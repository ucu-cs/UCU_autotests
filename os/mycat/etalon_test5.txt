FOREWORD


The dry wit of the New England Yankee has done much to cheer the Lonely
Traveler on his way. It has oiled the thinking machinery when it
creaked and provided inspiration for that spontaneous good fellowship
which helps so much to make life worth living.

The following pages are not the product of an overworked imagination,
but a record of actual happenings. The characters who pass in review
before the reader are real personages whose various experiences have
gladdened many adjacent firesides.

However, the author realizes that certain serious and literal souls are
so constructed that what to others is a source of glee and merriment,
is to them but \xE2\x80\x9Cthe crackling of thorns under a pot.\xE2\x80\x9D Hence the origin
of his conscientious plan to display in the book\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cshow window,\xE2\x80\x9D so to
speak, a sample of the brand of Yankee humor the reader may expect to
find should he resolve to read further.

Therefore, let us turn aside from these gracious words of the author as
above and consider for a moment the soliloquy of Uncle Andrew Cheney,
who did not like his son-in-law.

Uncle Andrew did not like work very well either, which is often
unfortunate for a husband and father of a family. In view of his own
impecunious state, it was peculiarly annoying to him to continually
be witnessing the lavish display of an elderly neighbor who had
considerable inherited property, but, who though a long time married,
was childless.

One summer evening Uncle Andrew was sitting disconsolately on the steps
of the little country grocery store, when he heard the clatter of
horses\xE2\x80\x99 feet and saw the well-to-do neighbor driving by with his pair
of high stepping colts. Uncle Andrew scowled but said nothing. Again
came the thud of feet and the horses and proud driver, coming back up
the country road, once more passed the store. Uncle Andrew glowered at
the spectacle with increasing disgust, but still managed to restrain
himself.

A third time the gay equipage swept past. This was too much and Uncle
Andrew, deeply stirred, began to talk to himself. A neighbor, sitting
near was the only listener, but what he heard he considered well worth
repeating.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Yes,\xE2\x80\x9D Uncle Andrew muttered. \xE2\x80\x9CYou are a mighty smart man, you are.
And you\xE2\x80\x99ve got some fine hosses, too.\xE2\x80\x9D

A gleam came in his eye.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a smart man, but I\xE2\x80\x99ve got one thing you haven\xE2\x80\x99t got and never
will have; and that\xE2\x80\x99s the biggest liar for a son-in-law there is in
this county.\xE2\x80\x9D

CHAPTER I

SHOWING SOME GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS


When the young business man or girl stenographer who has grown up
in one of the innumerable thriving towns or cities of the broad
Mississippi Valley, scans the morning paper on the way to the daily
task and reads of the incidental happenings duly chronicled as New
England News, there may perhaps be a glance of the mind\xE2\x80\x99s eye at
that little corner of the map of the United States as revealed in
the not remote school days. Then it was necessary, if one would be
on harmonious terms with the teacher, to at least memorize the state
capitals of Vermont, New Hampshire, and little Rhode Island, as well
as those of the somewhat much more imposing looking states of Maine,
Massachusetts, and Connecticut. And how small and insignificant they
all looked compared with the rest of the map!

It is true that geographies of good standing are not supposed to
deceive, but it is doubtful if any of them ever quite did justice to
the northeast corner of the U. S. of America.

And when, as sometimes happens in these modern times, the young
business man marries the little stenographer and by industry and
intelligence becomes prosperous, there is a desire for the well earned
holiday. He and the girl stenographer now become a matron, if permitted
choice, are impelled to explore that same little corner of the earth
so shabbily set forth by the map, but so attractively described by
acquaintances who have toured that section in summer.

And perhaps they will repeat these visits and view many smiling
valleys and listen to the soothing lullabies of the surf by night and
to unconvincing statements of hotel clerks by day--and yet will have
missed the most satisfying and illuminating characteristic of New
England--contact with the real typical New England Yankee.

Nowhere on earth does the aphorism that appearances are often deceitful
more frequently prove to be true than in New England, especially in
the rural districts. The impressive appearing motorist displaying
the now familiar license tag of the region may be a local tradesman
rated in the commercial register as \xE2\x80\x9Ccapital $500 to $1000, credit
limited.\xE2\x80\x9D Just behind in a cloud of dust the carelessly dressed man in
shabby looking buggy drawn by a placid old horse, may own a fine farm,
many pedigreed cattle and possess in addition an abundance of reserve
cash with which to take advantage of any favorable opportunity for
investment. While the apparel may \xE2\x80\x9Coft portray the man,\xE2\x80\x9D it is far from
being an infallible test in New England. Even when the native of this
region is transplanted to some bustling city, he is prone to develop
carelessness in dress as prosperity steals upon him.

       *       *       *       *       *

The native resident who remarks casually that the New England climate
consists of \xE2\x80\x9Cnine months winter and three months late in the fall,\xE2\x80\x9D
is not probably making any plans to remove elsewhere. He is taking
a sardonic pleasure in making it clear that he is laboring under no
delusions as to what the seasons will reveal in the months to come. He
makes no attempt to gloss over the enormities of the midwinter season,
but indeed seems to take much satisfaction in quoting the below zero
records which make a Philadelphian, for instance, gasp with horror.


Overlooked by Tourists

A sturdy woman of middle age, who had been born and raised in a
northern New England region, was chatting with a traveler about some
recent extremely cold weather and told him that the temperature at her
home had gone down to about 38 degrees below zero. As he expressed
some interest she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cover in the next town it was 46 below.\xE2\x80\x9D Upon
noting the surprise occasioned by this statement she hastened to say
that it was 52 below at the same time in another town about twenty
miles distant. She then assumed an expression of great candor and
proceeded, \xE2\x80\x9CMy daughter, who lives about ten miles beyond that place,
wrote that their thermometer registered 58 degrees below zero.\xE2\x80\x9D

She was a truthful woman and a good Methodist. The abashed listener
hastily changed the subject.

Stories of such extreme cold seem to be exaggerated, to strangers who
have traveled these districts in ordinary winter weather, but it is
merely exceptional rather than impossible. To people of normal health
such cold waves are merely an unpleasant incident. Those of experience
will insist that on the average the winter of even, steady cold is
healthier than the warm ones.

While there is, of course, a temptation to elderly people of means
to spend their winters in some warmer section, there are plenty of
instances on record to prove that it is usually better to \xE2\x80\x9Cstick
it out\xE2\x80\x9D at home, unless of course the change of climate is to be
permanent. Withstanding the cold develops vigor for the relaxing days
of spring and summer. Besides, in this matter as in many others, it is
evident that nature abhors a quitter.


\xE2\x80\x9CYear Before Last Winter\xE2\x80\x99s Snow\xE2\x80\x9D

It is the winter of unusually deep snows that stimulates the Yankee
sense of humor. An early summer visitor driving through a deep gorge,
scarcely touched at any part of the day by sunshine, found a man busily
shoveling snow which had evidently drifted deep across the road.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must have had lots of snow here last winter,\xE2\x80\x9D he remarked as he
drove by.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! no,\xE2\x80\x9D was the reply, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is winter before last\xE2\x80\x99s snow.\xE2\x80\x9D


The School Master and His Snow Grave

Among the legends clustering about a little country schoolhouse is a
comedy in which deep snow furnished the motif and more literally the
environment. An earnest young college student who was self-supporting,
secured the privilege of teaching the winter term of school. Among
his pupils were several husky youths to whom burning the midnight oil
made little appeal. It soon became evident to the parents that the
well-meaning but somewhat diffident teacher was destined for trouble.
A tremendous snowfall with high drifts brought events to a climax.
While the teacher was away for his lunch at the noon hour, the boys
dug a deep \xE2\x80\x9Cgrave\xE2\x80\x9D in a snowdrift near the schoolhouse, and when their
unsuspecting victim approached he was promptly seized, and in spite of
his struggles, placed in the grave and lightly sprinkled with snow.
Needless to say he was glad to resign his position and make way for a
successor of probably less education but considerably more muscle.

       *       *       *       *       *

The successive snow storms often bring about a condition of the back
roads that makes traveling difficult in the latter part of the winter.
Under these conditions it is an unwritten law that as compared with
those who travel light, the heavily loaded team shall have the right of
way. On a certain occasion this custom was peremptorily challenged.


Drifted Roads and the Right of Way

Two families of the neighborhood were far from friendly. Two brothers
of one of these uncongenial families returning home from town with a
horse and sleigh chanced to meet the robust scion of the other family
with two horses and a big sled loaded with logs. Instead of yielding
to the work team as precedent required, these young hopefuls demanded
half of the roadway. Although fully appreciating the personal motive in
this action, the driver of the log team blandly explained that if he
were to turn his horses into the soft deep snow by the roadside, his
load would be stuck in the drift. Interpreting this explanation as an
evidence of timidity, one of the young men jumped from the sleigh and
taking the two team horses by the bridles, started to turn them into
the drift. The driver was quick as well as athletic and in a very few
seconds a three cornered fist-fight was well under way. It was short
and decisive, after which the two brothers meekly turned their horse
and sleigh out into the snow drifts, passed the load of logs and went
home. The scarlet evidence of bloody noses in the snow soon faded, but
numerous firesides were cheered by the story which soon went the rounds
of the neighborhood.

While the rural midwinter season tends to physical inactivity, the
Yankee sense of humor is apparently stimulated. It may be said,
however, that while the sarcastic brand of humor is not popular,
occasionally some \xE2\x80\x9Cdeep thinker\xE2\x80\x9D will evolve an intricate plot like the
following.


The Post Holes in the Ice

In a certain community there was a newly hired farm hand whose
ingenuous innocence was a constant temptation. A young blacksmith
found out that the farm hand was especially fond of trotting races. He
accordingly proceeded to elaborate on a mythical trotting meet that was
supposed to soon take place on the lake. The stranger\xE2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled.
That was something like the real life. He asked what it was going to
cost to see the races. The blacksmith named a very high figure, but
hastily reassured the young man that it would be easy for him to secure
a season ticket if he would help to get things in readiness. The farm
hand eagerly agreed and asked what he could do. The blacksmith told
him that of course there would have to be a board fence around the
ice track and that it would be necessary to dig post holes in the ice,
indicating the section of the lake where the fence must be built.
The next morning the confiding hired man got a day off and promptly
proceeded to the lake, devoting several hours to the laborious task of
post hole digging before someone\xE2\x80\x99s curiosity led to an investigation
and the disillusionment of the victim.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is not characteristic of the normal New England mind to dwell upon
that which is somber. That trend of mind which contemplates with
satisfaction the gloomy and funereal, never fails to create amusement
among normal Yankees.


The Man Who Took Comfort at Funerals

There is an old time story of the eccentric old bachelor who lived with
his married brother, a bustling person of numerous activities, noted
for a propensity to begin many enterprises but seldom finish them. Poor
\xE2\x80\x9CHamp,\xE2\x80\x9D the bachelor, was constantly being speeded up at the endless
jobs. One day he announced his intention to take an afternoon vacation
and attend a funeral. His taskmaster objected.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy do you want to go to that funeral? You went to one only last week
and you never were acquainted with either of the families.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHamp\xE2\x80\x9D hesitated a moment. A half day\xE2\x80\x99s release seemed wonderfully
inviting.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, to tell the truth,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cabout all the comfort I take is in
going to funerals.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

The grim visaged old farmer who sits with bent shoulders guiding his
slow moving pair of farm horses along the dusty road, reflects the
stern realities of making ends meet--and perhaps a little bit more--as
the tiller of a rocky New England farm. But the smartly dressed tourist
may have far less of that mental flexibility which enables one to shift
the processes of thought from that which is burdensome to that which
renews the cheerfulness of youth. As an example of this capacity there
is the incident of the field of oats.


The Story of the Field of Oats

A farmer was standing by the roadside looking disconsolately at his oat
field which he somehow seemed to feel was a personal reproach. A cold
wet season had had a most discouraging influence and there was promise
of but a very small crop.

Along the highway came a well-known elderly citizen who would be sure
to notice the oats and estimate them for just what they were worth.
He stopped his horse and passed the customary salutations and seeming
in no hurry, the conversation covered quite a range of local topics.
The owner of the oat field began to breathe easier. Perhaps this man
had not noticed the oats. He exerted himself to be agreeable to the
traveler. The latter finally straightened his reins. The patient horse
began to look expectant, slowly started up and then the blow fell, but
not on the horse. His driver gave a comprehensive glance across the
field.

\xE2\x80\x9CYour oats,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Care short--but thin.\xE2\x80\x9D

For the benefit of the uninitiated it might be said that it is
perfectly possible to secure a fairly satisfactory yield of oats even
if in short stalk, provided that there is a thick stand. From the
foregoing it will be evident that the outlook in this case was very
unfavorable.

       *       *       *       *       *

Monotony is supposed, by those enlightened ones of the earth who reside
in large cities, to be inevitably associated with rural life, but youth
can generally be depended upon to provide a thrill now and then, even
in the back woods.


The Kitchen Dance \xE2\x80\x9CUp the Branch\xE2\x80\x9D

One evening in late winter, three enterprising young men in search of
diversion, decided to hire a horse and sleigh and attend a dance, which
by some underground source they had heard was scheduled for that date
at a farmhouse some three or four miles away \xE2\x80\x9Cup the Branch.\xE2\x80\x9D

Now, of course, the code of etiquette required these young gallants to
engage a barge, pair of horses and driver and also invite three young
ladies to accompany them. But funds were scarce with them and relying
upon what is now known as \xE2\x80\x9Cnerve,\xE2\x80\x9D they felt sure they could secure
dancing partners among the girls who would be sure to be present.

Driving up to the door of the farmhouse with a flourish, they turned
their horse over to the volunteer hostlers and joined the party. As
they were good dancers and not burdened with bashfulness, they were
not long in making acquaintances among the girls present and were soon
enjoying themselves greatly. To be sure they noticed a marked lack of
cordiality among the other boys, but they did not allow so trifling a
matter as that to disturb them.

All pleasures came to an end and about three o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the morning it
occurred to the three young heroes, that as each of them was expected
to be \xE2\x80\x9Con the job\xE2\x80\x9D that morning, it would be well to start for home and
get a little sleep. So they called for their horse and making graceful
acknowledgments to the young ladies for the pleasures of the occasion,
they put on their top coats and took their places in the sleigh.

The horse was quite restive and apparently in much haste to start. One
of the trio took the reins and the volunteer hostler, giving the horse
his head, they started at a fast pace homeward.

It was very dark and deep snows of the winter, now mostly melted away,
had left a rather uneven roadbed. There were frequent deep depressions
into which the rapidly moving sleigh would sink with nerve-racking
concussions. One of the passengers protested to the driver.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s the use in driving so fast?\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CMy teeth are all getting
loose.\xE2\x80\x9D

The driver tugged on the reins.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t understand the nature of the beast,\xE2\x80\x9D he said. \xE2\x80\x9CHere, get hold
of the reins with me and see if we can\xE2\x80\x99t make him slow down a little.\xE2\x80\x9D

They tugged at the reins with all their combined strength, but
apparently it only made the horse go faster. Accordingly they gave
their principal attention to getting through the \xE2\x80\x9Ccradle holes\xE2\x80\x9D with
as little shock as possible. The fast pace of the horse was rapidly
bringing them toward their home town and they soon saw the street
lights. The horse evidently had but one object and that was to get the
job over with and reach the stable and his own comfortable stall.

Moving down a long street at a very fast pace, the horse made a sudden
sharp turn toward his stable. The sleigh, skidding violently across
the wide, icy street, struck the curb and capsized, throwing the three
heroes of the dance out upon the sidewalk together with the sleigh
robes and other equipment.

The horse, with the sleigh still attached, then dashed up the street at
a mad gallop toward the stable.

Gathering themselves up, somewhat shaken and bruised, but not seriously
marred by their experience, the devoted three picked up the robes and
blankets and made their limping way to the stable.

They found the horse and somewhat shattered sleigh being inspected by a
much disgusted looking stable man.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s the matter with you fellows, anyway?\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t you know
enough to harness a horse?\xE2\x80\x9D

The light of the lantern solved the mystery of the wild ride home from
the dance. The obliging volunteer hostler had carefully refrained from
putting the bit in the horse\xE2\x80\x99s mouth.

After paying the bill for damages sustained by the sleigh, the young
adventurers decided that the boys \xE2\x80\x9Cup the Branch\xE2\x80\x9D had evened the score.


The New Maple Sugar Tub

Not far from the scenes of the above comedy, there lived on a little
farm, an elderly man of very thrifty habits. He took great pride in the
maple sugar he produced. Deciding to have the family supply all in one
large receptacle, he had a can made by a local tinsmith to contain two
or three hundred pounds of the finest maple sugar. This was filled at
the proper season and stored in an attic at the head of a long flight
of stairs. Several people of the vicinity were invited to inspect that
new sugar tub and its contents.

One day a great misfortune came to the farm. The house caught on fire.
There was very little water available with which to fight it and it
made rapid headway. It was soon evident that there was no hope of
saving the building, so sympathetic neighbors helped to remove such of
the contents of the house as could be carried out before it was too
late. The old man was naturally much broken up and while they were
looking upon the ruins, expressed his regret that he had lost that tub
of sugar. Someone said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought you were up there in the attic. Why didn\xE2\x80\x99t you roll it down
stairs?\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man turned a rueful countenance and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought of doing that, but I was afraid it would jam the tub up to
let it bump down those stairs.\xE2\x80\x9D


A Yankee Philanthropist

And now by contrast with the simple soul who took such pride in his
new, shiny, sugar tub, there is the story of another type of Yankee
whose business shrewdness had made him a marked man in the community,
even in the days of comparative youth. Cool, calculating and with
unerring judgment, all his various enterprises prospered, and he
was looked upon with wholesome respect as a man who lived up to his
contracts and expected the same of others. This man shipped livestock
to the Boston market and on a certain warm day in midsummer was to
send away a carload of fat hogs collected from the surrounding farm
neighborhood.

It is important that fat hogs intended for shipment be kept cool. Among
those who appeared at the proper time to make delivery, was a man from
a little farm away up on the mountain top. He had a very fat hog which
promised to weigh heavily and produce a handsome financial return.
Somehow he had been careless and allowed the hog to make the journey
in the hot sun without sufficient protection. At the first glance the
experienced buyer saw the hog was overcome with the heat and told the
owner that he could not accept it. The poor farmer was stupefied but an
inspection of the sick porker showed him that the shipper was justified
in his rejection. He was very much cast down and said that he had been
depending upon the proceeds of that hog to meet a pressing obligation.
The shrewd Yankee buyer in his cool imperturbable manner noting his
distress, turned to his assistant:

\xE2\x80\x9CHarry,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cmake out a check for the amount as per weigh bill,\xE2\x80\x9D
which was promptly done.

The check was handed over to the farmer and he was instructed to
take the hog, now in a state of collapse, to a remote corner of the
adjoining meadow, kill and bury it.

And yet, had anyone accused the hog buyer of being a philanthropist, he
would have resented the idea promptly.

       *       *       *       *       *

Another instance of philanthropy, bearing upon the same important
article of commerce, left a somewhat different impression.


The Butcher Who Was Too Generous

In a certain thriving town a meat dealer had gradually acquired a wide
acquaintance. As he was a genial man with a ready sense of humor, he
was regarded with general favor by outlying farmers as well as by his
local customers.

A man who had a farm back on the hills came to this dealer one day
and contracted to deliver to him on a certain date an unusually fine
specimen of dressed pork, guaranteed to be as near perfection as the
most fastidious customer could require.

The appointed day arrived and likewise the farmer and the hog, which
being placed upon the scales presented an attractive picture, at least
from the standpoint of those who like pork. The dealer seemed well
pleased.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy wife said it was a shame for me to sell this hog,\xE2\x80\x9D said the farmer
as the dealer started to adjust the scales, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe said she wanted that
hog\xE2\x80\x99s head for \xE2\x80\x98sowse.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! she did,\xE2\x80\x9D said the dealer, \xE2\x80\x9Cwell, I will make her a present of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

The butcher immediately proceeded to decapitate the hog and wrapping
the head up in coarse brown paper, handed it over to the delighted
farmer who was overwhelmed at such unexpected generosity. The butcher
then weighing the hog, figured a moment on a slip of paper and turning
to the till counted out the amount coming for the meat at the agreed
upon rate.

When the farmer handed the hog\xE2\x80\x99s head to his much surprised spouse she
inquired:

\xE2\x80\x9CHow much did the hog weigh?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt didn\xE2\x80\x99t seem to weigh up as much as I expected,\xE2\x80\x9D said the farmer. \xE2\x80\x9CI
thought it would weigh twenty-five or thirty pounds more than it did.\xE2\x80\x9D

The woman looked at her husband suspiciously.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid the butcher weigh the hog before or after he cut off the head?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe weighed it afterwards.\xE2\x80\x9D

The comments of the wife when she found out the real significance of
the \xE2\x80\x9Cpresent\xE2\x80\x9D she had received, may be imagined. The value of the head
would normally be about one third as much by the pound as the entire
carcass.




CHAPTER II

RELATING TO CERTAIN CONJUGAL INFELICITIES


The capacity of New England housewives for self-sacrificing devotion to
family has been made evident by many a biographical history of favorite
sons. When the father and mother are both united in the common purpose
of giving their children opportunities which were perhaps almost wholly
denied to themselves, it is seldom that serious conjugal differences
arise.

But, unfortunately, there are some whose natural good intentions are
easily undermined by their distaste for that monotony so commonly
associated with carrying out any worth-while plan.


Why Dave Left Home

In a certain rural district there was a man known familiarly to his
acquaintances as \xE2\x80\x9CDave.\xE2\x80\x9D He had a wife and several children, also a
small farm. To all appearances Dave and his rather unprepossessing
appearing wife lived on amicable terms. Both were frugal, industrious,
and regarded as well meaning people. Therefore it was with great
surprise that the community learned that Dave had disappeared under
circumstances that admitted of no doubt that he had acted deliberately.

Although badly upset by Dave\xE2\x80\x99s unwarranted action, his wife was
determined to keep her little family together and carry on the farm
as a means of support. Admiring her grit the neighbors showed their
kindness in many helpful ways and thus encouraged, the deserted family
managed to complete the yearly cycle in tolerable comfort.

During all this time Dave\xE2\x80\x99s disappearance was a continual source of
conjecture to the neighborhood. Nothing had been heard of him since
that early morning when he had been seen walking rapidly down the road
a mile or two away from home.

One evening a man who lived on a farm adjoining the one now being
conducted by Mrs. Dave, was reading the weekly newspaper. Suddenly
there was a faint tapping at a nearby window. Laying down his paper
the farmer proceeded to raise the sash. Seeing no one he asked who
had rapped. There was a hesitating step forward and a shadowy figure
appeared.

\xE2\x80\x9CSay,\xE2\x80\x9D said the visitor, \xE2\x80\x9Ccan\xE2\x80\x99t you put on your hat and walk over home
with me? It\xE2\x80\x99s me, Dave. I\xE2\x80\x99ve just got back and I\xE2\x80\x99d feel a little easier
about showing up to the Old Lady if you were along.\xE2\x80\x9D

So modest a request could hardly be denied. So the neighbor helped to
restore Dave to the tolerance if not the good graces of his wife. On
the way to his unsuspecting family, Dave was apologetically garrulous,
explaining how he had been working some distance away and could not
very well leave his job. As he rambled on making an evident attempt to
excuse himself, his companion\xE2\x80\x99s patience became exhausted and he turned
to Dave with the logical question to be asked by any honorable citizen.

\xE2\x80\x9CDave,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s all very well that you have been telling me,
but what I want to know is, how you could sneak off the way you did
and leave your family?\xE2\x80\x9D

Dave hesitated and then proceeded to pass out an excuse that probably
caused more local feminine indignation than the actual sin of
abandonment had ever done in all the surrounding region.

\xE2\x80\x9CI guess it was a kind of mean trick,\xE2\x80\x9D said Dave. \xE2\x80\x9CThat morning I went
off I had no real notion of going. But you see after I had got up, got
dressed, and started the fire, I happened to look in the bedroom where
my wife was lying asleep, hair all frowzy, mouth wide open, and snoring
so you could hear her out in the road.\xE2\x80\x9D

Dave hesitated.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe looked so awful homely I just felt as if I
couldn\xE2\x80\x99t stand it any longer.\xE2\x80\x9D

It is probable that having variously contributed to supplying the needs
of the abandoned family for an entire year, the indignant women before
mentioned were careful not to express their views in the hearing of
Dave\xE2\x80\x99s wife. At any rate the historian mentions no further gaps in the
family happiness. So it may be assumed that the couple lived in perfect
accord thereafter.

       *       *       *       *       *

And now, having brought this episode to a delightful ending, it is the
more to be regretted that another rupture of conjugal domesticity had
a very different conclusion. In this case it was the beloved wife who
wandered from home and fireside.


The Discouraging Matrimonial Experiences of Bill Jordan

A middle-aged man of good habits but limited executive ability had
acquired a small farm on which he lived and kept house for himself. It
was a very uneventful life but \xE2\x80\x9CBill\xE2\x80\x9D was well seasoned to monotony. As
frequently happens this monotony was suddenly interrupted, and as might
also be expected, by a woman. Although of unknown antecedents, the lady
was bland and ingratiating. She seemed to discover many attractive
qualities in Bill which he had never dreamed of possessing heretofore.
It is unnecessary to linger over details. A wedding took place at an
extremely early date.

Life now seemed worth living and Bill was a happy man. His wife was
a good cook and he was a good provider. But somehow the wife did not
seem to enjoy her husband\xE2\x80\x99s society exclusively and began to make other
acquaintances chiefly of the male persuasion. Among them was a gay and
debonair widower known as \xE2\x80\x9CJim\xE2\x80\x9D who appeared to have much more leisure
than Bill had. And when Jim struck out some time later to secure a
better paying job in another state, Mrs. Bill decided to go along too.

Bill made no attempt to trace the missing couple, but went back to
the old way of living without complaint. When friends told him he
was well rid of such a baggage, Bill thought of the good suppers she
used to get for him and was mute. For months nothing was heard of the
missing spouse, but at last there were developments which can perhaps
be best explained in the language of a faithful friend of Bill\xE2\x80\x99s, a
French-Canadian, named \xE2\x80\x9CJoe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI seen Bill on the street and I say to him: \xE2\x80\x98Bill, what makes you look
so glum; your wife come back?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98No,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D Bill say, \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98he ain\xE2\x80\x99t come back no more; he dead.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI say, \xE2\x80\x98Aw gwan, Bill! What makes you tink he dead?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98I seen heem on der paper.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI say, \xE2\x80\x98Aw you don\xE2\x80\x99t want ter believe all you see in der paper, Bill.
Dey got to print some lies for fill heem up.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

It appeared that Bill had that morning received a letter from some
alleged friend of the strayed woman which contained a clipping
mentioning the decease of Mrs. Bill and requesting that forty dollars
be advanced for burial expenses, a sum modestly designed to come within
the financial capacity of the bereaved husband.

Greatly against the advice of his friend, Joe, Bill insisted on
forwarding the forty dollars, after which he resumed his daily routine
of attending to his farm and cooking his meals. And again after many
months was the same routine interrupted.

One afternoon just as Bill had kindled a new fire in the cook stove,
so that his supper could be preparing while he was milking his cows,
there came a rapping at the door, which being opened revealed the
presence of Mrs. Bill, very much alive and wearing the smile which had
been so attractive while it lasted. Naturally there were explanations
to be made, but Mrs. Bill soon made it apparent that she had been a
sad victim of deception. And when she told Bill to go along and do his
milking and she would show him the best supper on his table that he had
seen since she went away, Bill was ready to let bygones be bygones. He
went to the barn and hustled his various duties, not even grudging the
forty dollars of which he had been beguiled for the flimflam funeral.
But his jubilation was short lived. No delicious supper was awaiting
his return. His wife was missing; likewise forty-six dollars in the
bureau drawer which Bill had been carefully saving up little by little
for taxes.

Thus did romance fade, and while it must be admitted that in this
depressing narrative of a woman\xE2\x80\x99s guile there are many suggestions
of humor, it is a sordid tale at best. But in another instance of
sadly impaired confidence, the victim\xE2\x80\x99s faith in a faithless wife was
restored to remain unshaken, thus establishing in concrete form the
formula that ignorance can really be bliss of a certain quality at
least.


Another Tale of a Confiding Husband

Hosea W-- was the possessor of a small property left to him by his
deceased wife who had inherited it from a notoriously frugal father.
Hosea was an amiable, simple minded person of very limited earning
capacity. Noting his loneliness after his wife\xE2\x80\x99s death, Hosea was
marked out as a worth-while \xE2\x80\x9Cprospect\xE2\x80\x9D by a widow, to whom to apply
the term \xE2\x80\x9Cdesigning\xE2\x80\x9D would be very inadequate indeed. Of a gracious
personality and a keen intellect, it was probably only because of a
reluctance to leave familiar scenes that she failed to become another
Cassie Chadwick.

As before stated, the widow classified Hosea as being worth her
consideration. He had certain small possessions, including a home,
and she was practically without a penny. To resolve was to act.
The conquest was easy and before the community had any more than a
suspicion of the real situation, the marriage knot had been tied.

To have a real home of her own after years of poverty was an agreeable
change. But there was a fly in the ointment. Although an adoring
husband, Hosea was not only vacant minded, but very economical. The
honeymoon, while a rapturous state of affairs to Hosea, became very
insipid to his broadly experienced wife. She resolved upon a solution
that would both rid herself of a tiresomely ardent husband and give her
possession of his property.

She thereupon began to take careful note of certain eccentricities
frequently revealed by her spouse. With the data thus collected, she
succeeded in persuading a physician that Hosea was in urgent need of
mental treatment and secured a certificate to that effect.

The next move was to take the unsuspecting husband on a little tour.
Among the interesting towns visited was one in which was located a
well-known retreat for the insane. The gracious bride suggested that
they inspect the asylum. Shortly thereafter the husband found himself
deprived of both wife and liberty.

News of this astonishing transaction spread rapidly. Indignation
developed everywhere among old friends and neighbors. They said Hosea
was foolish enough without doubt or he would never have married the
widow, but that he was no more crazy now than he had always been.
Application was made for a writ of _habeas corpus_ and within a very
few days the victim was set at liberty.

This rapid change in the order of events was made possible by the
fact that the county court was in session. After Hosea had appeared
before the judge he received quite an ovation. One by one his friends
congratulated him on having not only escaped from a nasty situation,
but on having also plenty of evidence on which to base the divorce
suit which was to follow.

Hosea expressed his gratitude for having such vigilant friends.
He would send his wife packing in record time. Well pleased with
themselves, the self-sacrificing neighbors returned to their various
homes, picturing to each other the discomfiture of the widow, but they
reckoned without their host.

A few days later the news was handed about that Hosea and the widow had
\xE2\x80\x9Cmade up.\xE2\x80\x9D She had convinced him that it was all a mistake. Love had
conquered.

       *       *       *       *       *

To consider this chapter complete at this stage would be to leave a
somewhat painful impression upon the reader. This is as unnecessary as
it is undesirable. In order therefore that this history of conjugal
vicissitudes be made to reflect in greater accuracy that noble
institution of matrimony, as it really is in so many happy households,
let us speak of the experience of another agriculturalist known
familiarly to his associates as a well disposed, amiable citizen with
an exceedingly capable wife and promising family.


\xE2\x80\x9CPurty Bur-r-ds\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJim\xE2\x80\x9D lived on very harmonious terms with his better half, but he had
one bad habit. When he had occasion to visit a nearby village for
supplies, he was apt to linger rather late. Under these circumstances,
his wife, with a proper understanding of the necessity of regularity in
farm details, would milk the cows. It is not of course to be expected
that she did this very willingly, but she would do it if the occasion
seemed to require it.

Late one evening in autumn, an acquaintance of Jim\xE2\x80\x99s, passing by his
establishment, was surprised to see Jim driving his cows in from the
pasture, same being presumptive evidence that they had not been milked.
As he passed the gateway he met Jim face to face.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt seems to me you are pretty late getting in your cows, Jim,\xE2\x80\x9D was the
remark.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s pretty late. I have just got back from town.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you have to milk \xE2\x80\x99em all yourself?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim, \xE2\x80\x9Cme wife can milk if she\xE2\x80\x99s a mind to.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s the matter tonight?\xE2\x80\x9D was the natural query.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! she\xE2\x80\x99s mad at me tonight,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe says she\xE2\x80\x99s good and tired
of doing the milkin\xE2\x80\x99 and me loafin\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x99round the town.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Jim,\xE2\x80\x9D said the traveler, who knew Mrs. Jim and admired her
spunk, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen the women get their backs up we have to do about as they
say.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s right ye are,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim, \xE2\x80\x9Cthey know how to raise the divil
himself when they feel that way. They are purty bur-r-ds but they have
their outs!\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

It will be noted by the reader that Jim accepted the inevitable which
was certainly the proper attitude. Every normal husband appreciates
the fact that the advantages of matrimony greatly outweigh any
associated drawbacks. In fact there is an occasional husband who seems
to appreciate it too much, which is abundantly illustrated in another
legend of rural New England, long since forgotten by most of the local
inhabitants.


\xE2\x80\x9CSeven Wives and Seven Prisons\xE2\x80\x9D

A young woman had continued to linger in the parental household until
she had considerably passed the average age of marriage. Somehow the
young men of her acquaintance had failed to appreciate her. Therefore
it was all the more gratifying when a recent arrival in the community,
a man of ingratiating appearance, began to pay her marked attentions.
Her romantic impulses which had been subdued by untoward circumstances,
could now be given full sway. Her admirer was impetuous and would hear
of no delays, and they were soon married.

The historian does not furnish any details of the honeymoon nor how
long it lasted, but it would appear that the bride, although of a
clinging nature, was very curious as to her husband\xE2\x80\x99s antecedents, and
this, unfortunately, was the weak spot in his armour. The more the
aforesaid antecedents were investigated, the more unattractive they
proved to be and within a very short time the bride indignantly refused
to have any further dealings with her husband, incidentally starting
a line of inquiry with startling results; the man was apparently a
bigamist.

With indefatigable zeal, the bride and her disgusted parents continued
their investigations which soon resulted in the bridegroom being snugly
established in the local jail.

Then followed a remarkable series of revelations. A wife was discovered
at about every turn in the crooked path of the prisoner, who engaged a
lawyer and resigned himself to the inevitable.

Some months were to elapse before a regular session of court and in
the meantime the bridegroom found time hanging heavily on his hands.
Apparently the game was up and, with the inordinate vanity of certain
criminal minds, he decided to write an autobiography. In due course
of time there appeared a remarkable book, entitled, \xE2\x80\x9CSeven Wives and
Seven Prisons,\xE2\x80\x9D which created a sensation. It also aroused much local
feminine indignation, because, in his desire to \xE2\x80\x9Cget even\xE2\x80\x9D with his
last wife, whom he regarded as responsible for his present misfortunes,
the bigamist declared in his book that of all the wives he had ever
had, she was not only the most disagreeable, but also the homeliest and
the most generally unattractive.

Apparently masculine depravity could go no further.


The French-Canadian Who Wanted a \xE2\x80\x9CWar for the Womens\xE2\x80\x9D

Owing to the frailties of poor human nature, it often happens that even
the most docile of husbands when disciplined, justifiably, of course,
by their life partners, will seem to resent it. This is no doubt due to
a yet remaining trace of that philosophy of the stone age which made
the husband regard his wife as being subject to correction by himself.
Of course with most enlightened husbands this quality, if it exists, is
merely atavistic.

\xE2\x80\x9CPete\xE2\x80\x9D was pretty well Americanized, but under stress of a little
excitement was apt to have relapses of his early struggles with his
verbs, singulars and plurals, etc. He was an estimable citizen in
many ways and fully appreciated by his wife, a buxom lady who could,
however, show a terrorizing sense of indignation on occasions when
\xE2\x80\x9CPete\xE2\x80\x9D had lingered too long with the bottle.

One of these interviews had just occurred and his wife\xE2\x80\x99s disapproval
had reached a new high record. A neighbor happened along just as the
lecture was finished and \xE2\x80\x9CPete\xE2\x80\x9D ambling somewhat uncertainly and
disgustedly toward his barn was heard muttering to himself:

\xE2\x80\x9COught to be a war for the womens; too many womens; kill off some of
the womens.\xE2\x80\x9D

But Pete was always glad to accept the olive branch and with his own
natural good sense and the loyal regard and good judgment of his wife
as factors, domestic felicity was always restored as soon as the
sobering up process was ended.

Thus it appears that conjugal life, often looked upon with great
skepticism by certain unmarried people, too cautious for their own
good, as being monotonous in the extreme, is very frequently much
the reverse; also that, generally speaking, husbands, especially of
advanced age, will agree that they have deserved most of the wifely
discipline they have experienced in their married lives, although
they may, especially if in a certain part of New England, quote to
prospective husbands, from the old time song:

    \xE2\x80\x9CAh! young man, how little you know,
      What trials do from wedlock flow.
    You have a few days and nights of ease,
      And then you\xE2\x80\x99ve a scolding wife to please.\xE2\x80\x9D




CHAPTER III

LEGENDS OF THE ECCENTRIC


The unusual mental twist which frequently escapes notice in the crowded
city, is often the center of interest in a rural neighborhood. Those
who thus excite morbid curiosity in their youth are indeed unfortunate
and often suffer keenly from the semi-ostracism which sometimes
follows. But the elderly who have developed unusual characteristics
seem on the contrary to rather pride themselves upon their
peculiarities, holding the view of the ancient Quaker who is reported
to have said one day to his wife: \xE2\x80\x9CEveryone is queer but me and thee;
and thee is some queer.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

Of the various minor misfortunes to which the elderly are subject,
perhaps deafness is the most to be dreaded. This is illustrated in the
case of the elderly country merchant.


\xE2\x80\x9CYou Don\xE2\x80\x99t Have to Yell at Me\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. H-- was the prosperous owner of a general store and had about
everything he needed except normal hearing. He was deaf, unmistakably
deaf, but with the pathetic obstinacy of some thus afflicted, he would
not admit it.

Late one afternoon a well-known citizen called at the store on an
errand for his wife. Others were waiting as the following transaction
was pulled off, and not strange to say, seemed to find it rather
amusing.

\xE2\x80\x9CI want a half pound of cream tartar.\xE2\x80\x9D

The storekeeper seemed unusually impressed.

\xE2\x80\x9CFreem Parker,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s happened to him?\xE2\x80\x9D

Freeman Parker was a well known and popular citizen of the vicinity.

\xE2\x80\x9CA half pound of cream tartar, I said,\xE2\x80\x9D the customer replied, raising
his voice.

\xE2\x80\x9CFreem Parker is dead,\xE2\x80\x9D said the merchant.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, when did it happen?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI want a half pound of CREAM TARTAR,\xE2\x80\x9D was the reply in a very loud
voice.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! you want cream tartar, do you,\xE2\x80\x9D said the dealer in icy tones.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou don\xE2\x80\x99t need to yell at me. I\xE2\x80\x99m not deaf.\xE2\x80\x9D

As before suggested, it is good policy in a rural district to cultivate
reasonably cordial relations with one\xE2\x80\x99s neighbors. Therefore it was
probably poor tactics for a certain exasperated farmer to set a bear
trap in his corn crib. To be sure, he was eminently successful, finding
an exceedingly undesirable citizen the next morning securely fastened
by one hand in the savage jaws of the trap. But it may be taken for
granted that the farmer, who released the man at once, must have felt
easier when the man left the neighborhood which it is hoped he soon
did. Another farm owner was much more diplomatic.


The Story of the Stolen Bundle of Hay

In this instance there was an exhibition of forbearance and strategy
much to be admired.

Finding the barn door open one morning in the late winter, the farmer
was at a loss to understand how the fastenings became loosened. Further
inspection showed that hay had been thrown down from the loft. Still
further examination revealed signs that hay had been carried away,
presumably in a bundle on somebody\xE2\x80\x99s shoulders.

A couple of mornings later there was further evidence of the same petty
thieving. The farmer decided to watch and see what happened. As it was
fairly comfortable sleeping on the hay rolled up in a blanket, the
adventure assumed a considerable degree of entertainment.

About midnight the farmer was aroused by someone carefully opening the
barn door. It was too dark to identify the intruder and in fact the
farmer did not want to know who of his nearby acquaintances could stoop
to anything so contemptible.

The thief had a long rope which in the dim light he laid upon the floor
of the barn. He next piled on as much hay as he could well carry on his
shoulders, and tying it up with the rope, he hastened away.

The farmer watched the man crossing the field. Suddenly an idea came
to him; he did not want to have trouble with a neighbor and he did not
want to lose any more hay. Following at a little distance behind the
thief, his footsteps naturally unheard because of the rustle of the
hay, the farmer struck a match and held it up to the bundle for an
instant and then dodged behind a tree. A moment later the hay burst
into flames. The thief dropped his rope and, screaming with terror,
rushed from sight. It was evident that he regarded the fire as of
supernatural origin. The farmer lost no more hay.

       *       *       *       *       *

Another farmer met a similar problem in a rather different manner. He
was not overburdened with tender solicitude for ne\xE2\x80\x99er-do-wells, as the
following record will show.


The Raid on Jim Green\xE2\x80\x99s Pork Barrel

Jim Green was the sort of agriculturalist who worked hard by day and
slept hard by night. It therefore required several successive attempts
one very early morning before his more wakeful wife succeeded in
arousing him.

\xE2\x80\x9CWake up! wake up!\xE2\x80\x9D said she, in a loud whisper, meanwhile nudging her
sleeping husband vigorously.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy--why, what\xE2\x80\x99s the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s somebody in the cellar,\xE2\x80\x9D she whispered, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve been hearing
strange noises for several minutes.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jim was now wide awake and hastily slipping on a few clothes, he made
his way to a window and in the dim light soon made out the figure
of a man crouched down by the cellar window, evidently working with
a partner. Further strain of the eyes revealed a pile of what Jim\xE2\x80\x99s
experienced vision showed him to be salt pork, lying on the ground at
the man\xE2\x80\x99s elbow. Jim tiptoed to a side door, opened it quietly and made
his way as silently as possible to where the man was kneeling. But
the slight rustle of his clothing or the jar of his footsteps alarmed
the watcher at the window and, glancing over his shoulder, he hastily
dodged around the corner of the wood shed.

Jim promptly took the missing man\xE2\x80\x99s place by the cellar window and
awaited developments. Shortly thereafter a man in the cellar came to
the window by which Jim was crouching and passed out several pieces of
very damp salt pork which Jim received silently.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve got all there is in the barrel,\xE2\x80\x9D he whispered, \xE2\x80\x9Cexcept the
last layer. Probably we better leave that so the folks here won\xE2\x80\x99t be
entirely out of pork.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D Jim whispered, \xE2\x80\x9Cpull it all out; what do we care whether they
have any pork or not?\xE2\x80\x9D

The man in the cellar went back and, plunging his arm deep in the
clammy brine, succeeded in digging up the last layer of pork which
he brought to the window, passing it up to the owner outside. He
then climbed out of the cellar window himself, where he was promptly
collared by Jim and identified as a shiftless farm laborer of the
neighborhood. He was soon released, however, after he had revealed the
name of his partner, another bird of similar feather.

Not until long after the two prowlers had removed from the
neighborhood, did Jim tell the story. Neighbors then remembered that
when Jim Green needed farm help, the two pork thieves always responded
promptly.

Comparatively few city born people realize how important a factor
the weather is in the daily routine of the farmer. They know that a
long-continued drought causes short crops and that floods sometimes do
considerable damage in certain valleys. Of the inconvenience caused
by unwelcome showers which sometimes become epidemic in busy seasons,
they have no knowledge. In a certain thriving farming section, there
had been a series of sudden thunder showers which had been very
discouraging to hay makers.


How Lote Platt Beat the Thunder Shower

\xE2\x80\x9CLote\xE2\x80\x9D Platt had grown somewhat irascible in his old age and weather
eccentricities had gradually become a personal matter with him. When
unceremonious thunder showers had soaked a certain crop of clover hay
about the third or fourth time, Lote began to feel peevish. However, he
spread the hay out to dry and after one wet surface had responded to
the sun\xE2\x80\x99s rays, he turned the other side up and early in the afternoon
found the clover in prime order to go in the barn.

He hastened to rake it into long windrows and was just preparing to
send his hired man after the oxen and cart when he heard the grumbling
of thunder and felt the coolness of the rain breeze. Another shower was
coming!

The hired man started on the run to get the oxen, but Lote soon
realized that the shower, and apparently a very wet one too, was going
to reach the hay field long before the oxen could be gotten there.

\xE2\x80\x9CBoo-boo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lote, as an unusually loud peal of thunder made the air
vibrate. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll show you something you never thought of.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lote was at the extreme windward side of the field and the long
rows of freshly raked hay stretched out before the strong breeze,
the forerunner of the approaching storm. Dropping on one knee, Lote
scratched a match, shielded it a moment with his old straw hat and then
held the blaze to the end of the windrow. Fanned by the wind, the fire
followed the long row of dry hay across the field. Then another blaze
followed by others also, and when the shower arrived, the clover which
had cost so much labor to be fitted for the hay mow, had ceased to be a
problem.

       *       *       *       *       *

When the proverbially amiable citizen bursts forth in rage, it is
astonishing to those who look on, and apt to be quite disconcerting to
a perfectly innocent victim. It certainly was to the lumberjack who was
\xE2\x80\x9Cbawled out\xE2\x80\x9D by Uncle Jimmy Ryan.


The Tale of the Old-Fashioned \xE2\x80\x9CSettle\xE2\x80\x9D

A logging enterprise was under way back along the edge of the mountain
and Uncle Jimmy\xE2\x80\x99s wife was induced by the boss to board some of the
help. A newcomer had joined the gang and was informed at quitting time
that arrangements had been made for him to join the others at Uncle
Jimmy\xE2\x80\x99s.

The new recruit made his way with a half dozen other husky workers to
the little low roofed farm house and going into the combined kitchen,
dining and living room, dropped his bag in a corner, tossing his
overcoat on one end of what seemed to be a large chest along the wall
back of the cooking range.

Uncle Jimmy, a short and roly-poly man of sixty-five or so, was moving
blandly about, speaking to one and then another of the \xE2\x80\x9Cguests,\xE2\x80\x9D
when suddenly his eye fell on the overcoat, hanging over one end of
the chest. Rushing forward, he caught the coat and turning to the
astonished man who owned it, proceeded to express great indignation,
although in his excitement he had lapsed into the Irish brogue of his
early days so that what he said was unintelligible.

Finally the wife who had kept serene during her husband\xE2\x80\x99s tirade, made
the matter clear.

The \xE2\x80\x9Cchest\xE2\x80\x9D was an old-fashioned \xE2\x80\x9Csettle\xE2\x80\x9D with an adjustable back. It
contained a mattress and at about five o\xE2\x80\x99clock every day Uncle Jimmy\xE2\x80\x99s
mother of ninety or more went to bed in the settle, the wooden back of
which was shut down, closing tightly. A circular opening in the end,
near the old lady\xE2\x80\x99s face, provided air circulation.

The lumberman had unknowingly closed the opening. The offender
apologized and harmony was restored.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is no place like the farm for those unfortunates whose ability
to perform crude manual labor is their chief asset. The farmer who
must exercise a never failing forbearance in the management of horses
and cattle often extends his sympathetic supervision over the mentally
defective ones who can be utilized in providing the necessary hand
labor. Thus it came about that one of those grown up children had found
a comfortable home at Mr. Hubbard\xE2\x80\x99s.


The Lost Harrow Teeth

Thomas was socially inclined and the boys of the community were too
kindly disposed to exclude him from their company.

The owner of a nearby farm had been \xE2\x80\x9Cseeding down\xE2\x80\x9D a stumpy addition
to his pasture, and early in the summer some boys, including Thomas,
wandered in that direction one Sunday afternoon, discovering a small
wooden harrow with iron \xE2\x80\x9Cteeth,\xE2\x80\x9D which had been left on the field until
a more convenient season. The shrinking of the wood in the summer sun
had loosened these teeth and a few of them had dropped out. Thus it
came about that the boys were afflicted with a wonderfully funny idea.

A few mornings later Mr. Perry, the owner of the harrow and
incidentally of several farms in the neighborhood, had occasion to
drive up to Mr. Hubbard\xE2\x80\x99s place on business. It was but a short
distance and he could easily have walked, but for the fact that he was
very lame.

Mr. Hubbard was at home, and receiving his visitor very cordially, they
entered into an earnest conversation. The child of misfortune, Thomas,
came around the corner of an outbuilding and seeing the two men so
busily occupied, stopped at once. He seemed to be much agitated.

The conversation continued, the two neighbors, however, subconsciously
watching the boy. Suddenly he rushed forward.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou old lame cuss!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, addressing the astonished visitor.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou old lame cuss! I don\xE2\x80\x99t know anything about your harrow teeth.\xE2\x80\x9D He
then dodged back out of sight.

The two men looked at each other in amazement.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you suppose he means?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Perry.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D was the reply, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I intend to find out.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHere, you, Thomas!\xE2\x80\x9D he called, \xE2\x80\x9Ccome back here.\xE2\x80\x9D

The boy came reluctantly forward, and after some questioning revealed
that the boys in their holiday spirit of mischief had concealed the
loose harrow teeth in a hollow stump near where the harrow lay as a
joke on the Perry boys--a trifling matter in itself but which had
assumed great and terrifying importance to poor unfortunate Thomas.

       *       *       *       *       *

To speak of the childish wrath of the aged is misleading in its
suggestiveness. More properly we should refer to the childish wrath of
the old man; for it is an undeniable fact that elderly women exhibit
much greater patience with the inevitable annoyances of life than old
men do.

A popular cartoonist has frequently exhibited these sudden tactics
of impotent wrath in a very amusing way. But his imagination never
has suggested anything more violent in its explosiveness than Uncle
Reuben\xE2\x80\x99s rage at a balky \xE2\x80\x9Csalt shake.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Story of the Salt Shake

Uncle Reuben and his more amiable wife were visiting with relatives.
His hostess was one of the New England type who never could do enough
for her guests.

Uncle Reuben who was quite advanced in years and whose habitual
irritability had proportionally increased, was feeling unusually
peevish this morning. It was midsummer and exceedingly warm and humid.

The contents of the glass salt shake allotted to this peevish old
gentleman had become, like everything else, affected by the prevailing
humidity. The most vigorous shaking failed to produce any results.
After repeated attempts, Uncle Reuben paused and quietly examined
the salt shake which he held in his hand. His amiable wife, knowing
his characteristics, looked anxious. His kindly hostess, also well
acquainted with the aforesaid characteristics, looked deeply concerned.

Finally Uncle Reuben spoke in those tones of forced calmness which are
usually associated with some great crisis.

\xE2\x80\x9CPauline,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI wish to buy this salt shake.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t sell it,\xE2\x80\x9D replied his hostess, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou may have it, and
welcome.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I want to buy it!\xE2\x80\x9D said Uncle Reuben in dramatic tones.

\xE2\x80\x9CI want to buy it. I want to take it out to the stone pile and grind it
to powder.\xE2\x80\x9D


\xE2\x80\x9CBetter Give Them to Some Poor Boy\xE2\x80\x9D

Just because a man has to be supported as a public charge by the town
he lives in, is no reason why he should not have some definite ideas
about correct dress.

\xE2\x80\x9CUncle Timmy\xE2\x80\x9D may have seen better days, but it was so far back in
his history that no one remembered anything about it. He was supplied
with board in a private family at the town\xE2\x80\x99s expense, the poor master
incidentally providing two other urgent necessities, _viz._, wearing
apparel and chewing tobacco, the latter being purchased in quantity and
\xE2\x80\x9Cdoled out\xE2\x80\x9D to Uncle Timmy little at a time, as otherwise the expense
of this luxury would have reached a very large item in the course of a
year.

About once in so often Uncle Timmy would happen around to see the poor
master to talk things over. He was very sociable indeed and would go
into all the details as to the menu at his boarding place, which was
very seldom satisfactory.

One day Uncle Timmy appeared, and after he had given a report of how he
was enjoying his present boarding place, it occurred to the poor master
that a certain pair of misfit shoes, which were of no special value to
anyone, might be utilized by this long-time guest of the community. So
he brought out the shoes and suggested that Uncle Timmy take them home
with him.

The old man turned the shoes over and over and examined them carefully.
When it was suggested that he try them on, as apparently they would fit
him, he shook his head.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CI guess I won\xE2\x80\x99t take them. You better give them to some
poor boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

There is no doubt that Uncle Timmy was naturally an aristocrat.




CHAPTER IV

FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS AND SMALL TOWN LIFE


Those sections of rural New England which have possessed natural
advantages sufficient to restrain the young people from their common
propensity to emigrate to the cities or to the western states, are rich
in family legends which show that frequent persistence of family traits
which is exceptionally pronounced in the six little states of the
northeast.

       *       *       *       *       *

A well-known family had occupied a prominent position in a certain New
England town for several generations. During all this period certain
pronounced characteristics had afforded amusement to the people of the
community, especially those of the father and daughter whose mental
processes are illustrated by the following narratives.


The Young Man Who Had \xE2\x80\x9CSpeerit\xE2\x80\x9D

The father had reached quite an advanced age, and although very
amiable, had become exceedingly economical. There were people who
would have said he was stingy--a common enough accusation against the
aged. Besides his commodious house in town, he had a small farm and
every spring he looked about and engaged some young man to undertake
the double r\xC3\xB4le of handy man around the house and farm laborer. The boy
who took that job could be always sure of steady occupation; he was
expected to rise early and work late.

One spring the old gentleman succeeded in securing a perfect treasure.
A boy of eighteen years or thereabouts was engaged from a distant farm
and came to town prepared to enjoy, what was to him, metropolitan
life. A naturally willing worker, he soon found that there was little
opportunity for recreation, at least during the daylight hours. In time
he gradually made acquaintances who soon confirmed his own opinion
that he was being imposed upon. He was still in awe of his employer,
however, but finally an occasion developed when he could restrain
himself no longer. On a very hot evening, after a hard day on the
farm, he was directed to go into the wood shed and saw up some very
dry fire wood of various uneven lengths. This was too much, and with
a fluency which absolutely astonished both himself and listener, he
proceeded to tell his employer just what he thought of his stinginess.
For several minutes the old man stood perfectly amazed, the boy
meantime hastening to his room, where he put on his best clothes and
went up town. He naturally expected to be discharged, but such was
not the case. After thinking the matter over a few minutes, the old
man began to chuckle to himself, after which he shuffled off up the
street, telling one citizen after another of his recent extraordinary
experience.

\xE2\x80\x9CI like that boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CHe has speerit.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Lady Who Secured a Wardrobe

This old gentleman had a wife who was in delicate health and a
middle-aged daughter who was not delicate. She was a very capable
housekeeper and as a rule not socially inclined. She stayed at home
month after month, year after year and finally her married sister and
sister-in-law, neither of whom were reluctant to point out the path
of duty to their amiable parent, insisted that it was only right that
\xE2\x80\x9CSally\xE2\x80\x9D should have a vacation. They pictured out the need of change
of scene, incidentally laying particular stress upon the even greater
need of a replenished wardrobe. The old gentleman was very reluctant
to yield to their persuasions, especially in the matter of the
appropriation for clothes. It gave him a pang to pass over the money
necessary for the outfit, but under such effective concurrent pressure,
the outcome can easily be imagined. He finally resigned himself to the
inevitable, wrote a handsome check and costumers were put to work.

While these numerous family discussions were going on, \xE2\x80\x9CSally\xE2\x80\x9D had
seemed to show but a languid interest. This was attributed by her
sisters to the fact that she had stayed at home so long that she didn\xE2\x80\x99t
want to go anywhere else. In the light of subsequent events it would
appear that their diagnosis was correct.

After the first pangs of separation from the cash, the father began to
take an extraordinary interest in the outfitting process. He passed his
judgment on the different fabrics, the styles into which they were to
be made up and seemed to be looking forward with anticipation to the
time when \xE2\x80\x9CSally\xE2\x80\x9D would start out on her vacation trip with a wardrobe
equal to that of any woman who had left that town in a long time.

Finally the outfit of new dresses, coats, hats, and other essential
articles was complete and the day was set when the vacation should
begin.

According to the plans, Sally was to go to New York to meet a family
friend, visiting other points of interest as her impulses might
suggest. The day of departure arrived, and Sally\xE2\x80\x99s father was alive
to the situation. A maid had been secured for a certain limited
engagement and she was called early and told to prepare breakfast.
The old man knocked vigorously on Sally\xE2\x80\x99s door to make sure that she
didn\xE2\x80\x99t oversleep. Breakfast was ready and Sally did not appear. Her
father began to be anxious lest she miss the train. He sent the maid
up to knock at the door, who returned saying that Sally had answered,
\xE2\x80\x9CAll right.\xE2\x80\x9D Still she did not appear and it began to be certain that
if she went that day she would have to go on a later train. Her father
was indignant at her unwarranted indolence. He went up stairs and
pounded once more on Sally\xE2\x80\x99s door, which she opened, clad in her usual
kitchen apparel. The old man demanded an explanation which was promptly
forthcoming.

\xE2\x80\x9CI didn\xE2\x80\x99t have the slightest intention of going to New York any of the
time, but I knew that the only way I could ever get you to furnish me
with any decent clothes, was to pretend I was going. Now I have the
clothes and I am glad to have them, and I am going to stay at home and
you can pay up that maid and let her go about her business.\xE2\x80\x9D

It must be regretfully stated that no record has been preserved of what
Sally\xE2\x80\x99s feminine relatives had to say to her.

In certain social circles astonishing heraldic pedigrees make their
appearance, heretofore all unsuspected by the average list of
acquaintances, but there can be no camouflage about family pedigrees
in a strictly rural neighborhood. An eminent financier in a New
England town had a relative who did not add any prestige to the family
escutcheon. Having little inclination to work and a very moderate
earning power even when he did work, a small annuity which he received
was greatly appreciated by this scion of a lofty family. For a short
time after his quarterly allowance arrived, \xE2\x80\x9CLafe\xE2\x80\x9D lived in luxury.


The Story of \xE2\x80\x9CLafe\xE2\x80\x9D and the Livery Stable Man

A widely known hotel man of the community had as a side interest, a
small but well equipped livery stable, which in the days before the
automobile, was a handy source of income. On a certain sultry summer
day who should ramble into the livery stable but Lafe. The owner
happened to be at the office and Lafe negotiated with him for the use
of a horse and buggy, for a couple of hours. Knowing his man, the
proprietor suggested that he had better pay in advance, as he himself
might not be there when Lafe returned. This was but an agreeable detail
to the man who was just then in funds and he passed out the money
without any hesitation whatever, after which he took his seat in the
buggy which had been run out of the barn preparatory to harnessing the
horse to it.

As stated before, it was sultry and Lafe was not only oppressed by
the heat, but also by several drinks he had enjoyed shortly before.
He fell asleep. Therefore, when the horse was led out, it was decided
that he better be led back into the barn again for a time and await
developments. Lafe slumbered on, finally arousing himself just about
the time when the two hours were up that he had contracted for. The
livery stable man was not a trickster, but he greatly enjoyed a joke.
He informed Lafe that he had had his ride so far as he was concerned,
having occupied the buggy and having been in a position to use the
horse, if he so desired. Lafe saw the joke, and being a good loser he
promptly went away with a broad grin on his face, resolving to \xE2\x80\x9Cget
even.\xE2\x80\x9D The livery stable man industriously spread the story which came
to Lafe\xE2\x80\x99s ears quite frequently.

Some months afterwards the stable owner happened to be about sixty
miles away taking a train for home and behold there was Lafe, also
taking the train. The memory of that unenjoyed but paid for ride was
still lingering in Lafe\xE2\x80\x99s mind, so he asked the practical joker if he
would not advance the money to pay his railroad fare.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy should you pay any railroad fares, when your cousin is a big owner
in the railroad?\xE2\x80\x9D was the reply. \xE2\x80\x9CYou just tell the conductor who you
are and he will pass you without any ticket.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you back me up, if I do tell him?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Lafe.

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly,\xE2\x80\x9D was the answer. \xE2\x80\x9CThat will be all right.\xE2\x80\x9D

[Illustration: A SHADY DRIVE \xE2\x80\x9CDOWN EAST\xE2\x80\x9D]

Whereupon Lafe took his seat in the front end of the day coach, the
livery stable man being seated with a friend in the back part of the
same car. Enter the conductor. He approached Lafe, demanding a ticket.
Then followed a brief but animated conversation as a result of which
Lafe turned and made a signal to the man in the rear of the car, who
promptly nodded his head. The conductor therefore proceeded about his
duties, collecting fares from various passengers, until he approached
the livery man, who, stating his destination, handed him a mileage
book. The conductor took the book and promptly detached two fares
instead of one. When the owner of the mileage book asked the reason, he
was informed by the conductor that he had been told by the man down in
front that he would get his fare at the other end of the car and that
he had confirmed the arrangement.

It may be taken for granted that among the habitues of the hotel and
livery stable, the foregoing transactions were fully appreciated. Lafe
was temporarily a hero, and no one enjoyed the joke better than the
livery man did.

While it was regarded absolutely essential in small town life to be
able, in New England phrase, to \xE2\x80\x9Ctake a joke,\xE2\x80\x9D there was of course a
reasonable limit. A joke ceases to be a joke when there is any evidence
of ill nature or maliciousness back of it. Just where the dividing line
comes in of course varies with the circumstances.

In a certain rural town there was a young man whose tendency to
slow wit was counter-balanced by a very amiable disposition. It is
not surprising therefore that there should have been those who were
inclined to take advantage and subject him to ridicule. This was less
annoying to the victim of these jokes than to some of his friends.


The Man Who Wanted to Fight a Year Afterward

One election day, in early September, the amiable young man in
question, after depositing his ballot and going down the stairs from
the hall where the election was held, was intercepted by some local
clown who, taking him entirely off his guard, kicked him down the last
few steps of the stairway to the floor below, where he landed in a
very undignified attitude. With unruffled amiability the victim of
horse play scrambled to his feet, brushed the dust from his clothes,
and joined heartily in the empty laughter of the onlookers.

His close friends had not happened to witness this episode, but heard
of it before leaving the hall. On their way home they expressed
themselves very indignantly and asked the amiable victim why he
submitted to such abuse, assuring him that he could easily make short
work of the other man and there was no reason why he should put up with
any such treatment. This put the matter in an entirely new light to the
man who had shown such remarkable good nature a short time before. He
thought deeply and said nothing.

The year rolled around and another September found the same assemblage
at the town hall for the election. Everyone had forgotten the stairway
incident of the year before, with one exception, and that was the
victim. To the absolute amazement of all present, he hunted up his
astonished antagonist of the year before and it required the combined
efforts of all the young man\xE2\x80\x99s friends to keep him from committing
serious assault on the joker. He was restrained with some difficulty
and taken to one side of the hall where his friends proceeded to
explain to him that his grievance was now outlawed.

The trademark has become no small factor in modern business. Its
imitation by rival firms is not only frowned upon as a breach of
ethics, but in most civilized or even semi-civilized countries, it is
illegal.


A Rural \xE2\x80\x9CTrademark\xE2\x80\x9D

There was one such violation, however, many years ago in a small town,
none of whose inhabitants perhaps had ever before heard of such a thing
as a \xE2\x80\x9Ctrademark\xE2\x80\x9D in its modern meaning.

One of the chief sources of income to farmers in that section was
butter-making. At that time all butter was put down in wooden tubs,
which were mostly hand made. An old growth spruce tree of good size and
of a certain grain would be sawed into right lengths. These would be
split with great care into staves. These in turn would be shaved down
as smoothly as possible, enclosed in ash hoops and fitted out with a
cover, the rim of which was likewise an ash hoop.

An old man who had become quite skillful in manufacturing these butter
packages, finally acquired such pride in his work that upon finishing
each tub he would take a soft lead pencil and write his initials in
large flourishing characters. As he was practically illiterate, his
monogram was all the more amusing to others.

These packages were not only supplied to certain farmers, but were
furnished to a nearby country store to be carried in stock. There were
other builders of hand-made butter tubs who were not so careful about
the finish of their articles.

One evening this creator of artistic butter tubs meandered to the
village store. A waggish individual who saw him there and enjoyed his
self-satisfied and expansive manner in the store, had one of those
bright ideas which so frequently afflict humanity. In the back room
of the store there were some butter packages manufactured by a rival
of the artist before mentioned. These tubs were a little more uncouth
in their getup than usual. The maker of this brand of packages had the
excellent taste not to identify himself with his completed product by
any monogram. Selecting one of the roughest looking of these packages,
the joker borrowed a pencil and soon produced a crude imitation of
the well known initials. He then walked into the inner store, handed
the butter tub to the rival manufacturer and asked him how he ever
had the face to put out such coarse looking work as that. The artist
indignantly denying any responsibility for the tub, or even knowledge
thereof, his attention was immediately called to the trademark on the
bottom.

This was the last straw and the creator of masterpieces in the
butter-tub making art, nearly produced a riot. He accused the
storekeeper of connivance and a gross fraud on the community and
threatened dire proceedings in other directions. The disgusted
proprietor of the store finally succeeded in explaining the matter.
The perpetrator of the joke slipped out of the store by the back way
and eventually the rumblings of wrath and outraged culture subsided.

       *       *       *       *       *

It has been before stated that the satisfaction of living on fairly
amicable terms with one\xE2\x80\x99s neighbors in a farming region tends to
develop not only much forbearance but diplomacy as well. This was
illustrated in a certain case where the bone of contention was a line
fence.


An Early Example of Camouflage

A certain man who lived on a small farm had a perfect mania for
lawsuits. This was not so uncommon in earlier days, as it was rather
in the line of policy of certain pettifogging lawyers to encourage
litigation.

Between his farm and the adjoining one there was a division fence
which seemed to be always falling to pieces. The man who lived on this
adjoining farm suspected that the cattle were not altogether to blame
for the frequent breaches in the fence. The cattle continued to come
over onto his land and he finally decided to devote one whole day, if
necessary, to watchful waiting. He therefore established himself in a
clump of bushes where he had a pretty good view of quite a stretch of
the fence, and not very long afterwards he saw the half grown son of
the belligerent neighbor approach the division line and loosen some of
the rails to such an extent that it would be an easy matter for the
cattle to get across.

The man on guard was puzzled for a moment just what to do, but realized
the importance of avoiding hostilities with his neighbor, if it were
possible. Finally he had an inspiration.

The boy who had done the mischief was well known in the neighborhood as
somewhat defective mentally. Hastily removing his old coat, which had a
very dilapidated lining, the resourceful observer turned it inside out
and again put it on, dragging his old felt hat down over his eyes. Next
he rubbed a handful of black dirt over his face, after which with blood
curdling yells, he started down the hills toward the boy. One glimpse
was enough for the youngster who fled to the house panic stricken.
A little later on the diplomatist, resuming his normal appearance,
apparently happened along in a leisurely way, repaired the fence and
went home.

By a perhaps not unexplainable coincidence, the cattle remained on
their own side of the fence thereafter.


\xE2\x80\x9CNoah Built the Ark\xE2\x80\x9D

In another locality there were four brothers whose personal traits
were so markedly individual as to make the family stand out somewhat
prominently in the community. All these amiable peculiarities were of
course thoroughly understood by the local inhabitants. First one of the
brothers and then another would figure in some transaction in a way to
bring out the same family characteristic.

The oldest one of the four brothers bore the biblical name of Noah, and
was a carpenter. Another brother often assisted him at the same trade.
Still another brother was a farmer, while the fourth had no settled
occupation.

These amusing details of the various activities of these brothers
finally inspired a local humorist to sum up the doings of the four in
the following luminous example of rural verse:

    \xE2\x80\x9CNoah built the Ark,
      Seth laid the floor,
    Jim drove the geese in,
      And Tom shut the door.\xE2\x80\x9D




CHAPTER V

THE YANKEE TRADING INSTINCT AND SOME AMUSING EXAMPLES


In the ordinary processes of trade the Yankee is a firm believer in
the old Roman Law of \xE2\x80\x9C_caveat emptor_\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Clet the buyer beware.\xE2\x80\x9D
While there may be occasional instances of neighborhood disapproval
where this principle has been worked out to the discomfiture of the
too confiding, in general it is held in respect as the only basis for
sound business. That there can be a new dispensation whereby business
can be carried on safely on the basis of a tender altruistic regard
for the financial safeguarding of those who lack the ability to think
for themselves, and thus produce that utopia which certain enthusiasts
would seem to regard as possible, has yet to be demonstrated.


The Story of the Eccentric Cow

There was a man who wished to buy a cow. There was another man who
had cows to sell. When the prospective buyer, known locally as \xE2\x80\x9CEd,\xE2\x80\x9D
looked over the herd of the seller, his eye rested upon a certain cow
which the latter was especially anxious to dispose of. He had indicated
what he would take for several other cows, but had carefully refrained
from making any reference to the particular cow. Noting this omission,
the buyer gave the animal in question very special attention and asked
the price. He was told that this cow was not for sale as she belonged
to \xE2\x80\x9CHannah,\xE2\x80\x9D his wife. Ed immediately became convinced that Hannah\xE2\x80\x99s
cow must be a very superior animal and lost all interest in the other
quotations. However, he made very little headway at first, but finally
the owner said he would go in and talk with his wife and see if she
would consent to sell her cow. He went in the house and was gone quite
some time, but finally appeared and said that his wife had consented
to let the cow go, although it was apparent from his tone that she was
very reluctant to part with it. The trade was soon made and Ed drove
the cow home in triumph.

Shortly after the animal was established in her new home it was time to
do the milking, and the proud owner proceeded to begin the operation.
He soon found that the cow was quite reluctant to be milked and when
she had kicked the milk pail across the stable two or three times, he
called on his hired man for help. Together they attempted to mollify
the fractious animal but the results were far from satisfactory.

The next morning the same comedy was enacted and Ed became quite
pessimistic. He decided that it was sort of a mean trick for a neighbor
to wheedle a woman into giving up her favorite cow and he drove to the
farm of the original owner and told him so. He carefully refrained from
making any reference to the eccentricities shown by the cow, believing
that by a master stroke of diplomacy in showing such consideration
for the other man\xE2\x80\x99s wife, he might negotiate an exchange. The former
owner listened to his remarks and again said that he would talk the
matter over with his wife. Ed waited anxiously for the result. After an
interval of ten or fifteen minutes the devoted husband once more made
his appearance and informed Ed that Hannah had \xE2\x80\x9Cgot over feeling bad\xE2\x80\x9D
and decided she would not be selfish in the matter.

The new owner of the temperamental cow greatly regretted his haste in
concluding the bargain before he had inquired more definitely as to the
cow\xE2\x80\x99s disposition. But, realizing that a trade was a trade, he made the
best of the matter and no doubt derived enough amusement by telling the
incident to his numerous acquaintances to offset his financial loss.
Had he asked the original owner the plain question if the cow objected
to being milked, he would have been told the facts without doubt. But,
noticing his eagerness to buy, irrespective of all ordinary rules of
prudence, the original owner could not resist the temptation to drive a
hard bargain.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the earlier days of agriculture in New England, no farm of any size
was regarded as properly equipped without a stalwart yoke of oxen,
which were best adapted to the rough stumpy fields and relatively
uneven highways. Although money was scarce, time was in adequate
supply. There followed the necessity of that great empire building
vehicle, the ox-cart.


The Remarkable Incident of the Cart Wheels

There was a well-known resident of a certain rural community commonly
referred to as \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Reuben.\xE2\x80\x9D Being a natural mechanic, he acquired
an enviable reputation as a wheel-wright who could turn out better
cart-wheels than anyone in that region.

All the average farmer needed was the two wheels, which were built
exactly alike; he could do the rest of the work himself in his spare
time, the pole or \xE2\x80\x9Cneap,\xE2\x80\x9D as it was locally designated, being a simple
affair, as also was the cart body.

To this master builder of cart-wheels there came one day a farmer from
a remote mountain side and bargained for a pair which were to be paid
for at some future time in farm products. The wheels were to be ready
for delivery on the following Saturday week.

Uncle Reuben proceeded leisurely about his task, as work was rather
slack, but completed his job on the Friday preceding the promised date
and turned out a rather better job than usual. That very afternoon a
well-to-do farmer from a nearby valley drove up to engage a pair of
cart-wheels and as soon as he entered the shop, his eyes fell upon
those just completed. They were exactly what he wanted and he insisted
upon having them. Uncle Reuben told him the wheels were already sold
and who was to have them. The man of affluence was urgent. Uncle
Reuben could make the mountain farmer another pair and as a clinching
argument proposed to pay cash for the wheels. Uncle Reuben hesitated
but the temptation of ready cash payment instead of merchandise was too
much. He accepted the offer, the money was paid and that evening the
purchaser sent his man for the wheels.

All the next day Uncle Reuben worked feverishly on another pair of
cart-wheels for the original purchaser. As he worked he formulated the
excuse he must offer to allay the other man\xE2\x80\x99s disappointment. Along in
the afternoon the mountaineer appeared to get his wheels. He did not
get the wheels of course, but he carried away a most unique excuse.

In his blandest manner Uncle Reuben explained the matter very clearly.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know,\xE2\x80\x9D says he, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t see how in the world I could have done
it, but when I had got the wheels all finished I found I had gone and
built two right-hand wheels. A man came along who thought he could use
them and I let them go.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

There is probably no more effective form of the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cpitiless
publicity\xE2\x80\x9D than that which throws its calcium moral rays upon the
unconventional resident of a rural community in New England. There can
be little that transpires that is not only well known but carefully
weighed in the balances. There is an illuminating legend which tells of
an unwise battle with rural public opinion.


The Thrilling Experiences of a Mountain \xE2\x80\x9CDoctress\xE2\x80\x9D

A woman who with her husband and child had taken up her abode in a
remote district was at first well received. She became interested
in the little church and being of a bland disposition and an alert
mind succeeded in passing the censorship with comparative credit.
Unfortunately for herself and child the husband died and soon there
were rumors that she was not showing a proper sense of bereavement.
The local atmosphere became chilly and she decided that she must do
something to indicate proper devotion to her husband\xE2\x80\x99s memory.

About fifteen miles away, there was a distant cousin of her late
husband who was a dealer in monuments. To him she appeared one day
and mournfully announced her desire to erect a monument to her late
husband. She admitted that she had no money to pay for it, but said she
had a piece of land with a house upon it and that she would willingly
sacrifice that property to ensure the creation of a suitable memorial.
The dealer and incidental relative was very favorably disposed, not
only to the ingratiating widow, but to what apparently was a promising
venture. A trade was soon made, the widow departed and in a short time
the monument was properly erected in the cemetery. Nothing was said at
that time as to a transfer of the real estate, but some weeks later
the dealer being in the town where it was located, decided to take a
look at his new property. He found a small irregular patch of rocks and
bushes with a tumbledown rough board shanty upon it. A few inquiries
soon made it clear that the joke was on him and he never made any move
to secure a title. After a time the humor of the transaction overcame
his disgust at the trick and he told the story on himself, to the great
joy of those better acquainted with the characteristics of the widow.

It must be regretfully chronicled, however, that even the monument
failed to reinstate the lady in the good graces of her feminine
neighbors. She was lonely, very short of cash and possessed of an
inventive mind; naturally there were developments. For years there was
no lack of conversational topics in that community, at least among the
women.

Shortly after the monument episode there appeared an imposing looking
sign on the front of the widow\xE2\x80\x99s residence, containing her name with
the very unusual title, \xE2\x80\x9CDoctress.\xE2\x80\x9D Such medical knowledge as she
possessed was not claimed to be the result of any special study but
rather the evidence of some extraordinary intuition. There were plenty
of similar instances in the days before the practice of medicine was
legally restricted. It soon became apparent that the widow\xE2\x80\x99s patients
were chiefly resident boarders, generally one or two lonely old
widowers. In a vague sense, therefore, it may be seen that the widow
had forecast in her mind the general idea of the sanitarium, then
practically unknown. The hum of gossip reached a high crescendo and
the sanitarium project was soon abandoned--not however, because of the
gossip but for lack of sufficient clinical material to pay expenses.
Thereupon the people of the township began to wonder what would happen
next. They didn\xE2\x80\x99t have long to wait.

Although the possessor of extraordinary gifts in the healing art,
the widow had other talents which were not kept in obscurity. She
\xE2\x80\x9Cdickered\xE2\x80\x9D in real estate in a necessarily small way and was a horse
trader of recognized ability. But her ambition at this time was in the
medical field and having removed to commodious quarters she announced
her great discovery, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Mountain Envigorator.\xE2\x80\x9D

Although this panacea was widely heralded as calculated to relieve most
of the physical ills of mankind, and although Emerson, the Sage, has
pictured in graphic language the great procession of people who would
eagerly penetrate the trackless wilderness to do business with the
inventor of a better mouse trap than the one probably in use at the
Philosopher\xE2\x80\x99s Concord residence, there was singular apathy manifest
regarding the Envigorator. Sales were very, very slow and expenses
large.

However, the widow was resourceful. She fitted out a two-horse pedlar\xE2\x80\x99s
cart and engaged an assistant to travel about with her and help
introduce her remedy.

Thereupon for a season the money began to flow back to the widow\xE2\x80\x99s
purse. But such prosperity was too obvious to the assistant who soon
began to clamor for an exorbitant salary. It was a crisis and must be
met and was met.

At this time the widow\xE2\x80\x99s personal charms had become somewhat mellowed
with age, but she decided to exercise them. The young man with a
fortune in sight soon succumbed and they were married.

It will probably occasion no surprise to relate that the husband\xE2\x80\x99s
financial demands soon exceeded his most preposterous claims as an
employee. Dissensions arose, the business languished and the bridegroom
departed. The widow also went away, never to return, but before leaving
she accomplished a master stroke which aroused the admiration of the
most censorious women of the countryside.

In a nearby village there was a woman who had succeeded in making
herself feared for her vindictive type of gossip. She had long
specialized on the widow\xE2\x80\x99s affairs. Not content with revealing what she
knew, she finally surpassed herself with a story which could easily
be shown to be false. The victim saw her opportunity and the romancer
was given her choice of an immediate retraction or jail. A day or two
later the widow and the gossiping dame made the rounds of the village
and adjacent farms. At each call the hostess was informed by the widow
that her companion had an explanation to make. Whereupon the woman of
the poison tongue would proceed to relate that in telling the story
in question, she had drawn wholly upon her imagination. Before the
housewife could recover from her astonishment at such an unprecedented
narrative, the widow and her victim would have departed to convey the
glad tidings elsewhere.

       *       *       *       *       *

While there are few who can surpass the typical New England Yankee as
a natural shrewd trader, there are numerous residents of that section
of Canadian-French, Irish or Italian ancestry, who are amply qualified
to hold their own. A conspicuous example of this type of shrewdness is
recorded in which an Irishman, widely known as \xE2\x80\x9CTim,\xE2\x80\x9D took the leading
part.


The Expedient of the Cow Buyer

\xE2\x80\x9CTim\xE2\x80\x9D had a large farm and always had cows to sell to buyers, provided
he could get his price, which was usually a stiff one. To replace
animals thus disposed of, he would travel around the surrounding
country, securing a cow here and there, as they could be picked up at
his price. A fortunate sale left him very short of dairy cows, and
hearing of a farmer living some distance away, who had some to sell, he
lost no time in appearing on the scene.

The farmer in question had twenty good looking animals, but even Tim,
with all his experience and judgment, could not for the life of him
make up his mind which were the most desirable for his purpose. As he
saw the farmer did not know who he was, he assumed the guise of the
confiding novice. He asked the farmer to put a price on ten cows, as he
might select from the herd. After some hesitation the seller named a
figure which was a very fair price for good cows but a high price for
most any other kind. Every herd has its star performers and just how
to get the best from the herd was a problem. After much discussion and
innocent talk on his part, Tim finally asked the farmer to recommend
the cows that would be likely to be satisfactory to him, if he was to
accept his offer. This idea seemed to be attractive to the seller,
and he proceeded to point out a cow here and there in the herd until
he had finally named the ten to make up the order. Tim\xE2\x80\x99s decision was
immediate.

\xE2\x80\x9CAll right,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll take the other ten.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was an unexpected turn of affairs to the seller, but he was a man
of his word and Tim drove his ten best cows away with that deep sense
of satisfaction which the skillful trader always experiences when
things have come his way.

       *       *       *       *       *

It may be assumed therefore that the modern form of sentimentalism,
of which we hear so much in certain circles, whereby the energetic
and thrifty are held in disapproval because they do not show a tender
solicitude for the indolent and incapable, is not widely prevalent
in rural New England. Every real Yankee who gets the losing end of
a trade, under fair circumstances, accepts the results of his own
incapacity and resolves to be more cautious in the future. As an
example of this give and take state of public opinion may be mentioned
the case of the man who had contracted with a mechanic for a new milk
sled.


The History of a Milk Sled

The mechanic was well qualified. It could be taken for granted that
a finished article from his hands would be satisfactory. The only
difficulty was in getting him to complete the job. Being occupied with
various details he was inclined to procrastinate. In this instance he
made an excellent start, had the sled well near completion, and then
for some unaccountable reason could not seem to get the time to finish
it. The customer would inquire every day or two as to the prospects.
There was an abundance of promises but very little action. Several
weeks went by. The situation became very exasperating.

The builder of sleds had an excellent article of his own employed in
his collateral enterprises. One day the customer whose old sled was
now in the last stages of dilapidation, saw the mechanic on his way to
town and came to an instant decision. He drove to the latter\xE2\x80\x99s home,
changed his horses to the mechanic\xE2\x80\x99s sled and proceeded about his
business. When he saw the owner he told him he could have his property
back when he had finished the job promised weeks before. The mechanic
grinned appreciatively, and in a very short time the contract was
completed.




CHAPTER VI

DOMESTIC ANIMALS AND THEIR PART IN LEGENDARY HUMOR


One of the strongest potential arguments in favor of the so-called
\xE2\x80\x9Cback to the farm\xE2\x80\x9D movement, is seldom appreciated by city dwellers,
_viz._, the opportunity thus afforded for companionship with the
domestic animals.

To the average person there are horses, cattle, dogs and cats; but
those, especially farm people, who are in intimate daily contact
with these animals, realize that every horse, cow, dog and cat has a
separate individuality. Children brought up in such associations soon
recognize all these distinctive traits and thereby acquire a much more
broad understanding of the general manifestations of nature than is
possible to the children brought up to look upon such animals with
contempt, if not with dread.

People of average attainments in business, or socially, seldom
appreciate how much contact with domestic animals has to do with the
development of practical common sense and self-reliance among those who
have been fortunate enough to spend their early days in an agricultural
environment.

On every farm of any importance, the daily routine must to a certain
degree take into account the varying individual traits and capacities
of the farm animals. The boy who has grown up in these surroundings and
who has been taught to restrain his impatience, to exercise forbearance
and to help induce the sense of felicity and general comfort among the
domestic animals on a farm, which is essential to their well-being,
has incidentally laid the foundations for the development of that good
judgment which usually determines the difference between success and
failure.


The Story of a Wandering Sheep

The sheep is generally regarded as a very uninteresting animal, but
occasionally there is an exception.

A man who had a small farm, stocked mostly with cattle, had a few sheep
which he kept in a small pasture by themselves. Among this flock was
a young masculine who had gradually acquired the opinion that he was
an unusually brilliant and promising sheep. In order to exhibit the
good opinion he had of himself he developed a pugnacious tendency and a
disposition to wander about. Escaping from the pasture, he was reported
one day as being a trespasser on the farm of a near neighbor.

The following evening the owner of the young sheep proceeded to the
neighbor\xE2\x80\x99s farm to reclaim the wanderer and put him back where he
belonged. It had been a showery day and everything was saturated with
rain. Approaching the farmyard where the strayed sheep was reported
to be, the owner saw the wife of the farmer engaged in milking a cow.
Incidentally, he saw the sheep on the other side of the cow from the
matron. And almost immediately he saw other developments. The sheep
had been regarded with strong disfavor by the strange cows with which
he was surrounded and with a spirit of resentment he suddenly started
head down at the cow being milked. Although the lady who was busily
engaged in the milking process was totally unconscious of what was
happening, it was not so with the cow. Just at the psychological
moment, the cow sprang forward and the sheep came in violent contact
with the lady and the milk pail. The impact was so great that the woman
was thrown over backward in the soft mud of the barnyard, the contents
of the pail being liberally distributed about her robust person.

Although the physical injury was not serious, the damage to the lady\xE2\x80\x99s
dignity was such that the owner of the sheep decided that it was a very
inappropriate time to claim his missing property and hastily beat his
retreat to make his reappearance when the lady\xE2\x80\x99s wrath had somewhat
subsided.

       *       *       *       *       *

While the lady sheep is a model of amiability under practically all
circumstances, as before suggested, the male of the species develops
egotism at a very early date; he also develops a tendency to resent
anything and everything that reflects upon his dignity. So, while
it is entirely appropriate to emphasize the educational advantages
of farm life to growing boys and girls as calculated to develop many
desirable qualities, it is easily possible for such contact to result
disastrously to the young male sheep as evidenced by the following
depressing incident.


The Young and \xE2\x80\x9CSelf-Centered\xE2\x80\x9D Ram

Another young and somewhat self-centered male sheep had been tantalized
by small boys until his dignity was deeply wounded. He was one of
two or three that followed a herd of cows around a large pasture on
a dairy farm. In a certain portion of this enclosure there were some
wild raspberry bushes, and a certain estimable scrub woman of the
neighborhood went to the pasture one day to pick some berries. There
was something about this woman that didn\xE2\x80\x99t meet with the approval of
the young sheep and he made a sudden attack which resulted in the loss
of the berries and incidentally produced a few bruises. The woman
escaped from the pasture and went to the farmhouse and expressed her
indignation that any such wild beast should be allowed to be at large
to commit assaults on the neighbors. The owner of the sheep, a very
amiable man, apologized profusely and directed that the animal be
kept in confinement, at least until the berry season was over. He was
therefore confined in a ramshackle stable, tied behind a loose board.

Enter the villains of this tragedy! four small boys, each armed with a
small, harmless, but otherwise objectionable birch stick. The prisoner
glared at them, whereupon one after another they advanced and tapped
the young ram playfully on the nose with their sticks. In violent
resentment he would lunge forward against the loose board, making a
tremendous racket. Although this enterprise only lasted a few minutes
before it became tiresome to the gamins in question, it was sufficient
to completely wreck whatever might have been previously left of this
sheep\xE2\x80\x99s amiability. He became an anarchist then and there.

The next morning was rainy and there was no probability that any berry
pickers would visit the pasture, so the sheep which had expressed his
dissatisfaction by many loud protests during the previous days, was
gladly released to be allowed to go at large. It was here that Grim
Tragedy stalked forth. The farmyard was a quagmire as a result of the
rain and as one of the older \xE2\x80\x9Cboys\xE2\x80\x9D started to carefully pick his way
through the mud with two brimming milk pails, the sheep caught sight of
him and decided that this was the time to avenge some of those insults
of the day before. Just as the young man was crossing the deepest
portion of the bog, he was made the victim of a rear attack. The result
can easily be imagined. In his great wrath, extricating himself, he
cornered the pugnacious sheep and changed him into mutton in a very few
seconds.

It has been stated before that contact with the various animal
inhabitants of a well equipped farm is in itself an educational process
of no small value; it may be added that there is often as much
diversion as education in these experiences.


The Sudden Enlightenment of the Young Pup

Much has been written of geese and their superior mental qualities as
compared with other fowl. It is true that they are wise in certain ways
and that the average hen is very stupid by comparison. But the hen is
a never-ending source of amusement to many people, especially when
zealously engaged in bringing up a brood. It might be almost assumed
that the hen has reasoning power at times, as for example:

A collie puppy was added to the equipment of a certain farm and after
a few days he began to make a general tour of investigation. He seemed
to find the young chickens about as interesting as anything and while
doing them no injury he would nose them about to the terror of the
chickens and the great indignation of the mother hens. At a time
of emergency some noble figure should always step forward and this
emergency was no exception. Early one morning the pup was seen flying
across the yard, uttering the most agonizing cries, one of the maternal
hens standing squarely in the middle of his back, incidentally giving
him her opinion of dogs in general and himself in particular. The hen
hopped off and went back to the chickens and the puppy was absolutely
cured. He had no further curiosity in that direction.


A Hen Heroine

Another true instance of hen wisdom deals with an ancient female
of that species, who had lived to ripe old age because of her
extraordinarily good judgment in bringing up chickens. One day the
owner heard a great outcry. Looking out she saw the hen engaged in a
vigorous battle with a crow. It may be incidentally mentioned that
while the crow does not ordinarily molest young chickens, there are
exceptions and this was a very bold marauder indeed. However, he
reckoned without his host, as the old hen had lived long enough and had
acquired sufficient knowledge of crow depravity to meet the emergency
in a business-like way. She viciously attacked and continued to fight
the crow, who was unable to get in a position to fly away, until help
arrived and the crow was promptly dispatched. No young fowl, a year
or two old, would have had the requisite courage, but this hen, who
had long since passed the stage of edibility as poultry, had gradually
developed the intelligence and pluck to fight the crow with his own
weapons.

It is often pathetic to see how difficult it is for a normal small boy
who lives in the crowded sections of a big city to find any legitimate
outlet for his energies. He grows up with relatively few opportunities
to develop any sense of personal responsibility. Not so the boy on the
New England farm. If it is a real farm and conducted as a means of
livelihood for the family, responsibility is constantly camping on his
trail.


The Story of the \xE2\x80\x9CLolling\xE2\x80\x9D Horse

Two farm boys about ten years of age who lived in a period when there
were no automobiles, had early been accustomed to the care of farm
animals and had incidentally had some casual experiences in driving
horses.

One day they were given permission to visit a married cousin of one
of the boys at her home some miles away. For the first time in their
young lives they were allowed to start out alone with a horse and
buggy. It was a great occasion and they began their journey with much
anticipation, but before they had gone a mile Dull Care had settled
upon them and attended them continuously until their return in the
early evening.

Only a short time before, one of the boys heard a distressing story
relating to an ox that had died from being overheated. A premonitory
symptom of the approaching demise of the ox had been that he \xE2\x80\x9Clolled.\xE2\x80\x9D
This had made a deep impression on the boy who heard the story.

It would hardly seem to be necessary to explain that of all domestic
animals, the horse is the only one which perspires freely. This affords
relief to the horse when hard at work on a warm day. And it of course
provides a clue to his condition. The teamster will not push his
overheated team horses too hard. With the ox team it is different. Heat
exhaustion may be near and still there will be little or no evidence
of such condition, the most characteristic symptom, however, being the
tendency of the ox to \xE2\x80\x9Cloll\xE2\x80\x9D or allow his tongue to protrude from his
mouth in his panting efforts to perform his task.

Therefore with this bovine tragedy fresh in mind it is easy to imagine
the consternation of these two holiday seekers, when, after jogging
along at a comfortable pace for a mile or two, the horse, beginning to
show some evidence of perspiration, and turning his head to snap at a
pestiferous fly, disclosed the fact that his tongue was protruding.
The boys looked at each other with horror. What had they done? The
none too reluctant animal was restrained to a slow walk and after a
time the boys saw with great relief that he had his tongue back in his
mouth where a horse\xE2\x80\x99s tongue ought to be. They slowly made their way to
the home of their hostess and, not wishing to disclose the fact that
they had been overdriving their horse, they carefully refrained from
speaking of the heavy weight of anxiety with which they were oppressed.
They made an early start for home and after a slow, tedious journey
in the hottest part of the day, they arrived and turned over their
horse apparently as sound as when they had taken him in charge. Their
mysterious manner, however, caused interest and when the facts were
made clear, it afforded much amusement to the two families who could
not refrain from making subsequent allusions to \xE2\x80\x9Cthe lolling horse.\xE2\x80\x9D
It may be said in explanation that the horse in question merely had a
little habit of occasionally protruding his tongue, which the boys had
never happened to notice before. It may be taken for granted, however,
that the sense of responsibility thus displayed by the boys, was not
lost sight of by their elders.

And it may also be assumed that the next time that horse was driven by
those boys, he was not permitted to lag on his journey.

       *       *       *       *       *

The common exchange of farm implements, wagons, or sleds, in rural New
England, does not generally include the loaning of team horses. The
average farm horse, as before suggested, has his special individuality,
and it is not a difficult thing for a work horse to get demoralized
in the hands of a strange driver. In such cases, he may become very
reluctant to take hold and pull a heavy load.


The Farmer Who Borrowed the Blind Horse

A certain farmer, however, had a horse which he was always ready to
turn over to any responsible borrower. The horse was blind and his
age had long been a matter of conjecture. One day a neighbor, unaware
of the extraordinary docility of this poor, blind beast, asked if he
could have the horse to drive eight or ten miles on a necessary errand.
Permission was readily granted and he led the horse home, harnessed
him, and started out. He succeeded in getting back home in the middle
of the night. The next morning he led the horse back to the owner.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is my custom,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cto pay for a borrowed horse in praising,
but this time I want to pay some other way.\xE2\x80\x9D

Just how much blindness had to do with the total lack of courage
of this borrowed horse would be hard to say, but it was probably a
contributing factor.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is sometimes hinted that people who have retained health and
comparative youthfulness to an advanced age, have reason to thank
themselves for the excellent judgment they have manifested in avoiding
undue exertion rather than for any unusual inherited vigor. There are,
however, other factors besides the avoidance of physical labor to be
considered, as for example, cheerful temperament and an active, alert
mind. This latter quality seems to hold good with the animal creation
as shown by the following example.


The Lame Horse That Was Suddenly Cured

A young couple, who had arrived at a state of mind in which there
was considerable mutual interest, found it very desirable one day to
take a little drive. Their parents lived on two adjoining farms and
it was a busy season. Spare horses were scarce. Finally an agreement
was reached. The young lady agreed to furnish horse and harness if
her companion would furnish the buggy. This seemed to be a practical
arrangement and they started gayly out on their trip. After lunch in
town, there seemed to be nothing else to do but start for home, but
they were in no great hurry to arrive there, so at a certain turn in
the road they decided to make a detour.

The little Morgan mare of quite advanced age, contributed by the
young lady as her quota of the team, had very peculiar ideas. She
thoroughly disapproved of the trip in the first place, and secondly the
young man\xE2\x80\x99s driving was also entirely different from anything she was
accustomed to. At the prospect of returning home, however, she seemed
to cheer up amazingly until she found herself being turned off on the
side road. She moped along for a few yards and then began to be very
lame.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a nice prospect!\xE2\x80\x9D said the driver. \xE2\x80\x9CI think we had better turn
straight around and get home, if we can.\xE2\x80\x9D

The young lady was quite well acquainted with the little white mare.

\xE2\x80\x9CLet me take those reins,\xE2\x80\x9D said she.

She took over the reins and gave the poor, lame horse a couple of
slashes with the whip and a miracle was performed. The lameness was
cured in an instant.

One of the most frequent tragedies of agricultural life is where some
farmer allows himself to feel that he has somehow lost a considerable
part of the pleasures of life by living remote from town. In such a
case the farmer, if well to do, may dispose of his farm and move to
a nearby village. And then, far too often, physical and even mental
degeneration will soon be in evidence. Lack of occupation is no doubt
a considerable factor, but the loss of the interest and congenial
companionship associated with domestic animals is probably no small
item in this disintegration.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the consideration of animal life and its influence upon farm
environment, the wild birds should not be overlooked. As with the human
race, these birds present the varying characteristics of those who are
helpful and popular and those who constitute a problem.


The Bird Policeman

The crow is both a pest and a useful citizen. He is not nearly as
popular with the average farmer as he ought to be. It is the old story
of the roughneck\xE2\x80\x99s total contempt for the opinion of his neighbors,
human or otherwise. The crow\xE2\x80\x99s attitude is in general as follows: \xE2\x80\x9CYou
can\xE2\x80\x99t put anything over on me.\xE2\x80\x9D He is an ardent believer in \xE2\x80\x9Ccollective
bargaining\xE2\x80\x9D and when it is desirable to raid a field of ripe corn, the
entire crow colony is carefully organized for the purpose. Pickets
will be established to warn of the approach of any man with a gun.

But, however sardonic may be the attitude of Mr. Crow toward the poor,
plodding human farmers, he is quick to recognize his master, the
kingbird.

In a certain farmyard the crows and hawks had established a reign
of terror among the hens and chickens. Broods of chickens would be
depleted one by one until there were few survivors and the women of the
household became thoroughly exasperated. This went on to a greater or
less extent for several years. One bright June morning a certain Mr.
and Mrs. Kingbird arrived from a more southern clime and looked the
premises over. They decided that there was an excellent opportunity
to establish a home in one of the shade trees. They had hardly got
at work, however, before the male bird found it necessary to take up
a certain line of police duties. He discovered that the crows and
hawks had been making themselves very much at home in that immediate
neighborhood.

Within twenty-four hours the word had gone around to all the marauders,
and for years thereafter they never came near those premises again.
Each season the kingbird and his wife would come back. That was
sufficient protection for the young chickens who could scratch about
within the limits of their enclosure with perfect safety. It can be
taken for granted that everything was done by the owners of the farm
to make it pleasant for the bird policeman, who by his extraordinary
activities and fearlessness strikes terror to the heart of the swiftest
hawk, lest he be blinded by one of the lightning dashes of the kingbird
who always aims for the eyes.


The Evicted Swallows

At the same farm some swallows had established a system of commodious
mud dwellings under the eaves of the south and east side of the
barn. They occupied these premises year after year with apparent
satisfaction. One spring they were abruptly and summarily dispossessed,
although allowed to re-establish themselves on the other side of the
building. This is but a mere detail in bird life. The warm southeastern
exposure looked good to some bluebirds and they promptly evicted those
who had apparently secured the right of possession by a long lease.


The Proprietary Attitude of the Robins

Robins, to most people, are merely robins. It would surprise the
average city inhabitant however, perhaps, to know that even the robin
may be individualized by farm dwellers, so that a certain old cock
robin who has been coming back, presumably with the same wife, year
after year, is promptly recognized on his arrival. In advanced years
the cock robin sometimes seems to develop obesity or at least great
abdominal extension, which may quite naturally be due to gradual
indisposition to labor but with no compensating tendency to reduce
rations. This is, however, so frequently observed in other male bipeds
that it should not occasion surprise.

The robin is perhaps the most popular of birds in the rural districts.
It is an unwritten law among native New Englanders that they shall
not be harassed or molested. The house cat which has been detected
catching a robin is in great disfavor immediately.

About the first sure indication of actual spring in this section is
the appearance of these welcome birds whose cheerfulness seems to be
contagious. They seem to be socially inclined toward humans and are
quite apt to locate their nests in close proximity to some farmhouse.
Indeed at times they seem to assume a rather proprietary attitude
toward the farm owners themselves, as shown by the following typical
incident.

One sultry day in July, it was noted at a certain farmhouse, that
there seemed to be considerable excitement among the robins. They
were unusually vociferous and someone wise to their habits suggested
that probably the young birds were about ready to make their first
trial flights. On the Sunday morning in question, most of the family
had gone to church when a certain slacker, who was left behind, took
his comfortable seat on the porch facing the lawn. The house dog was
lying on the grass nearby and all was quiet among the robins with
one exception. The exception was expressing high disapproval of
something. Suddenly there was the chatter of a squirrel in a clump of
trees a short distance away, and the dog arose to his feet and started
leisurely down to investigate. When he had gone about fifty feet there
suddenly developed a perfect din of protest, several robins joining
in the chorus to explain to the dog how unwelcome he was and no doubt
including various other uncomplimentary comments.

It was plainly depressing to the dog; he had had no quarrel with the
robins and saw no reason why they should talk to him in such abusive
terms. He came dejectedly back to his original location and lay down.
The chorus of disfavor stopped. Meantime, however, the robin in the
tree directly in front of the porch continued his tirade. Finally
the dog again arose and went around the corner, the man on the porch
decided to go in the house, and immediately all clamour ceased.


The Haunted Cat

At another farmhouse there were two well fed and properly cared for
cats actively engaged in the ever necessary warfare against mice. A
colony of swallows had built their nests under the eaves of a large
barn. So far as the human inhabitants of the farm could know there
was no essential difference in the moral characters of the two cats.
But while one of these cats could circulate around the buildings and
no swallow would seem to take any interest in the matter, as soon as
the other cat made her appearance in the space between the house and
barn, various active members of the swallow colony would immediately
issue forth from their retreat and proceed to swoop around and around
the cat a few feet from the ground, to her great discomfiture and
embarrassment. It became practically impossible for the cat to go out
of doors without undergoing this ordeal. She became a nervous wreck and
finally had to avoid this open area and take her promenades in another
direction.

It would be interesting to know just why the swallows made such a
discrimination between the two cats. Possibly the object of their
resentment had some time succeeded in capturing one of the birds, but
such an achievement by a cat is not very common, as the swallows are
extremely agile and capable of keeping out of reach. And if one cat
had become unpopular for this cause, why should not the swallows have
adopted aggressive and protective tactics toward the other cat who
might naturally be expected to follow the same predatory instinct if
given the opportunity?

To people who have spent their entire lifetime in the city, these
incidents of animal life might easily seem to be mostly imaginary,
but to those who are of receptive mind and keep a watchful eye upon
the various activities of the animal creation as revealed to them
by residence in the open country, there is presented a panorama of
individual traits, numerous and delightfully varied.




CHAPTER VII

LEGENDS OF RURAL SPOOKS


It must be regretfully stated that the old time folklore of the
supposed supernatural has apparently vanished from modern New England.
Skepticism has seized upon the present generation and such genuine
unalloyed ghost stories as still persist are regarded as the harmless
delusions of old age. Thus, much that furnished thrills in earlier days
has departed.

They were creepy enough, those ancient tales. And in most instances
they were vouched for as strictly true by people whose reputations for
veracity were beyond dispute.


The Ghost in the Milk Dairy

Take the story of the milk pans as an example. The people who occupied
the milk pan infested residence were an intelligent church going family
of the highest standing. They were not superstitious and in fact
regarded their spooky experiences as a joke. They had a dairy farm at
a period when cream separators were unknown.

The process at that time was to \xE2\x80\x9Cset\xE2\x80\x9D the milk in shallow tin pans
and skim off the cream when the milk had become sour. The cream was
then made into butter. Where there were quite a number of cows, a
considerable stack of these tin pans was required. Such as were not in
use would be placed in an orderly pile on a high shelf in the milk room.

Therefore, it can be readily understood that if one of these pans was
to slide off the shelf to the floor, it would make a loud noise.

Now, suppose the farmer and his family were sitting around the evening
lamp and all at once an unearthly din in the milk room should indicate
that a dozen or perhaps two dozen of those six-quart milk pans had
rolled from the top shelf to the floor, we would naturally expect one
or more members of the family to go at once to investigate.

Well, this highly respectable and truthful family would do nothing
of the kind. They would remain quietly reading the weekly paper, or
knitting, or popping corn, according to age and disposition; because
they knew no milk pans had stirred an inch. It was merely the spook
amusing himself.


The Spook Story of the Runaway Horse

A family lived on a back hilly road, and where the highway passed
their house it was quite steep. Comparatively few teams would be seen
during the day and still fewer would be abroad at night. It therefore
might be expected that when all the sounds of a horse galloping wildly
down the road with a rattling wagon at his heels should be heard, the
people would rush to the windows and doors to find out whose horse was
subjecting his driver to probable injury or sudden death; but they
didn\xE2\x80\x99t--at least after the first few times. They knew no horse was
running away; it was only the spook.

And still there are people in this age of jazz who think the \xE2\x80\x9Cold
times\xE2\x80\x9D had no excitement.

Most of the practical jokes of the spook were harmless, but in a given
instance he seems to have gone rather too far.


Table Tipping and a Victim

As could be expected a certain number of people were disposed to take
these \xE2\x80\x9Cmanifestations\xE2\x80\x9D quite seriously, regardless of the ridicule of
their neighbors. A group of these seekers after occult knowledge had
gathered one evening to engage in their favorite avocation of \xE2\x80\x9Ctable
tipping,\xE2\x80\x9D and were unusually favored with \xE2\x80\x9Csigns.\xE2\x80\x9D The small table
around which they were seated became so totally unmindful of the force
of gravity that a recent novitiate of corpulent figure was induced to
seat himself upon it to keep it in place. No sooner had he taken his
position than the table began to float about the room.

It was a triumphant moment for the believers. They were succeeding
beyond their wildest anticipations. The table, after various
oscillations, approached the stairway, still carrying the portly
investigator. Clinging to it were a number of enthusiasts who stumbled
up the stairway well toward the top. Suddenly the invisible force
weakened, and the table with its burden, fell with a crash.

The victim was considerably bruised but otherwise physically uninjured.
His vanity had however received a hard jolt and he took no further part
in the s\xC3\xA9ances.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is significance in the fact that although most people of the
rural districts long ago lost interest in \xE2\x80\x9Cspirit\xE2\x80\x9D phenomena, it has
lately engaged the attention of city dwellers to an increasing extent.
Such investigations passed under the ban of country people because of
the current impression that they were generally demoralizing in their
influence. Those who maintained the churches were skeptical and this
developed antagonisms, which affected attendance upon church and Sunday
school. The \xE2\x80\x9Couija board\xE2\x80\x9D is about all there is left of the old time
manifestations in rural New England.


The Story of the Ouija Board

But even the ouija board can carry consternation to the wayward.

A New England youth of unusually good looks became impressed with
the idea that his face could easily be made to be his fortune. The
matrimonial route seemed to be easiest and after a short courtship he
became the husband of a woman of considerable wealth. To be sure she
was quite deaf and some forty years his senior, but there could be many
collateral diversions. His elation was short lived. The old lady had
not lived so many years without acquiring wisdom. She promptly added
to her other bridal accessories a \xE2\x80\x9Couija\xE2\x80\x9D with which she soon became
proficient.

Before his marriage the young husband had made the acquaintance of
numerous fair ones of whom chorus girls seemed the most congenial. But
he soon found it wise to avoid their company. With her faithful ouija,
his wife could have him shadowed at all hours of the day. It was too
uncanny. He became the most docile and punctilious of husbands.

Coincidence often assumes an uncanny resemblance to the so-called
supernatural. Instances in which a certain type of dream was followed
by disaster are common to all classes of people. But what is to be said
of \xE2\x80\x9Csigns\xE2\x80\x9D during waking hours? as for example the following legend of
a highly intelligent married couple who would have scorned to palm off
such a narrative unless authentic.


The Unreal Arrival of Uncle Mark

Late one summer evening these middle-aged parents of a considerable
family had just retired to rest, the younger people being long since
abed and asleep. All at once the silence of the farm was broken by the
sound of a horse and buggy coming rapidly up the main road, and which
turned from the highway, passed through the yard and up a driveway into
the horse barn. The farmer and his wife exchanged glances, one of them
remarking that \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Mark,\xE2\x80\x9D a brother of the farmer, was evidently
making one of his customary unannounced visits.

Then followed the familiar sounds of the horse being detached from
the buggy and led into the stall. The farmer hastily readjusting his
clothing, took the lamp and went down stairs to admit the visitor.
Seeing and hearing no one he went down the porch and crossed the yard
to the barn. He found no strange horse, wagon or driver.

When the wife was told that what they had both heard so distinctly was
a delusion, she looked very grave.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat means bad news,\xE2\x80\x9D was all she said.

The farmer and his wife went to bed and let us hope they slept
the sleep of the just. The next morning a telegram announced the
sudden death of a near relative. It would be hard to convince any of
their descendants that this fine old couple had betrayed any weak
superstitious delusions in describing this mysterious combination of
happenings.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is probable that the experienced traveling salesman is about as near
immune to superstitious thrills as any type of citizen, but in one
specific case even his iron nerve gave way.


The Locked Door Which Swung Open

A young man of exceptional vigor and equipoise, traveling through a
hilly country, had occasion to make a late journey across a mountain.
The road was poor and the traveling tedious and he found that he had
sadly miscalculated the time required to complete the trip. He decided
to stop at the first likely looking farmhouse and beg for a chance to
stay over night.

By this time it was very dark but he was able to get a glimpse of
two or three cabins on the way that seemed too utterly unattractive
for consideration. Finally he came to a more commodious looking
establishment and decided to go no further if he could possibly avoid
it. Stopping his horse in front of the house he hallooed several times.
There was no answer, so inferring the inhabitants were sound sleepers,
the young man concluded to first find shelter for his horse and then
come back and in some way or other secure a night\xE2\x80\x99s lodging for himself.

An outbuilding was located and unharnessing his horse, he tied him to a
beam and after giving the animal some hay and a bedding of the same,
he went back to the farmhouse, intending to pound on the door until he
aroused the inmates. But he did not pound on the door.

As the weary traveler approached the front step, the door began to
turn, swung around slowly and finally stood wide open. There was not
the slightest noise nor sign of any human agency associated with the
door. Every individual hair arose on the young man\xE2\x80\x99s head. He thought
with joy and relief of that good, faithful animal munching his dry hay.
He hastened back to the shed, lay down as near the horse as safety
would permit, and so managed to pass the night.

At daybreak he resumed his journey, but before leaving he observed
positive evidences that the house was uninhabited. The door was locked!

It is probable that had the salesman had the time and disposition to
make a careful daylight inspection of the vacant house, he might have
discovered some perfectly natural cause for the mysterious actions of
the front door. But his curiosity was not very active just then.

       *       *       *       *       *

In another instance, the investigations of a traveling salesman nearly
caused a case of sudden death by heart failure.


The Joke Played on the Hotel Porter

This young man found himself marooned for the Sabbath at a little
hotel in a back country town. Sunday afternoon, finding nothing better
to do, he proceeded to put the blas\xC3\xA9 hotel clerk through a third
degree examination in regard to any local points of interest which
might alleviate the general tiresomeness of the situation. The only
interesting feature apparently possessed by the town was a haunted
house guaranteed to be genuine in every respect.

There was the usual legend of some ghastly tragedy, and the record of
spookish antics, frequently associated with such histories. Altogether
the salesman was disposed to consider this a real find and worth
looking after.

The most conspicuous member of the hotel staff was a colored porter.
Bland and attentive, this young man took his position very seriously
indeed. The salesman became very chummy with the porter. He found
several occasions to utilize his services and showed his appreciation
by liberal tips. It therefore seemed only natural to the porter that
the salesman should propose that he have his company for an evening\xE2\x80\x99s
stroll to look over the town, especially as the suggestion was
associated with the promise of an extra half dollar.

In his conversation with the clerk, the salesman had learned the
general location of the haunted house, and waiting until it was quite
dark he started out in that direction with his escort. He remarked on
the darkness of the night, saying it was just the kind of a night for
ghosts to be on duty. Finally he asked his companion if he knew of any
haunted houses in town. The porter rather reluctantly admitted that he
did know of one and that they were getting pretty near to it.

By this time the porter had evidently lost interest in the excursion
and suggested that he would be needed at the hotel. He was, however,
prevailed upon to go a little further. Shortly afterward, there loomed
up a large old-fashioned dwelling surrounded by considerable grounds
which he pronounced to be the haunted house. It was uninhabited, of
course.

The porter again urged that he would be needed at the hotel, but the
salesman insisted that he must get a little nearer before going back.
When nearly opposite the house, he stopped and took a careful look at
the building which now looked dismal enough in the dim starlight.

The salesman was possessed of a voice that he could make unusually
penetrating. He suddenly gave a tremendous leap backward and yelled in
a most agonizing tone.

\xE2\x80\x9CGreat Heavens! What is that?\xE2\x80\x9D

But his companion did not answer. He disappeared down the road at a
pace that no professional sprinter could excel.

       *       *       *       *       *

In \xE2\x80\x9Cthe good old days\xE2\x80\x9D a ghost seems to have generally appeared
to investigate any unusually spectacular murder. This came about
according to custom following the celebrated pedlar mystery.


The Pedlar Who Disappeared

A German Jew had built up a profitable trade among the farmers in a
certain section and was looked for every summer by his customers. He
traveled with a horse and cart and carried a considerable stock of
silks for dresses and heavy black broadcloth for men\xE2\x80\x99s suits. Another
item of considerable importance in his business was a choice stock of
Paisley shawls.

The prosperous farmer of that period was expected to provide his wife
with at least one black silk dress in addition to the one she may have
had as a part of her wedding outfit, the shawl adding the final touch
of elegance to her wardrobe.

Naturally the wife would expect her husband to be dressed according to
her standard, and that meant at least one new broadcloth suit every
ten or fifteen years. Therefore the pedlar could always count upon a
considerable number of sales and it can be taken for granted that he
made at least a fair profit.

It was, however, often necessary for him to extend credit as actual
money was very scarce in those times. But he knew his customers and
rather encouraged this class of business.

One season the pedlar made his usual rounds, did a considerable credit
business, delivering his goods as usual and--was never seen again.

The farmers who had provided themselves with funds to settle their
accounts could not understand the case. The pedlar was apparently the
last man of their acquaintance to neglect his collections. Time passed,
the year rolled around and nothing was heard. It was indeed a mystery.

One day a marvelous story went the rounds. A well-known young man
announced that he could keep his secret no longer. He had a confession
to make.

He said that about the time of the pedlar\xE2\x80\x99s last visit, returning home
one evening, he had overtaken two men on a lonely road through the
woods, who were carrying a heavy burden wrapped in a blanket. Finding
they were discovered the men had required him, on penalty of death, to
help them bury a man\xE2\x80\x99s body. It was the pedlar.

Pressed for details as to the identity of the probable murderers, he
named two well-known business men of a nearby town who, presumably,
tempted by the large sums of money habitually carried by the pedlar,
had committed the crime.

The accused were naturally placed under arrest, but their denials of
the crime were not vehement as might have been expected, but were
calmly contemptuous. They arranged their affairs as best they could
and settled down to endure confinement in the county jail as patiently
as possible until the next session of court. There does not seem to
have been any evidence to corroborate the testimony of the principal
witness, and when he later appeared before the county prosecutor and
told him the alleged confession was merely a romance suggested to his
mind through a badly distorted sense of humor, there was nothing
further to be done with the alleged murderers except to release them.

While in these latter days such a hoax on the authorities would likely
prove unpleasant to the joker, he apparently escaped any legal penalty.
But he found it expedient to shortly leave the neighborhood, as the
theory was promptly advanced that the original confession was really
justified, but that the witness had in some manner been induced by the
accused parties to retract, probably by a liberal bribe. His later
prosperity in a large New England city was generally attributed to this
source by censorious former neighbors, although others, probably better
informed, were aware that he was a highly paid and valued employee in a
large mercantile establishment.

This would seem to be the logical end of this narrative, but although
the subsequent history of the case can be rather briefly told, what has
been heretofore stated is but the beginning of the story.

Those who had been accused of the crime did not follow the example of
the unreliable witness, but remained to spend the balance of their
days attending to their usual occupations in the town where they had
lived so long. One of these men was considerably older than the other,
and although there had been no special intimacy apparent between the
two from year to year, when the older man eventually developed what
promised to be a fatal illness, the other promptly gave over his
business to a subordinate and took up his abode at the home of the sick
man. Day after day, and in fact night after night, he was always at
the invalid\xE2\x80\x99s call and it was generally and plausibly reported that no
one was left alone with the sick man from that time until his death.
Naturally those who enjoyed the sensational, immediately assumed that
the attendant was afraid to permit his former alleged associate in
crime any opportunity for private conversation with others lest he
unburden his mind by a confession.

Enter the ghost!

During the last years of the man so carefully watched by his partner,
he lived in a large old-fashioned house on a back street, surrounded
by ample grounds. The household consisted solely of himself and an
elderly woman acting as a domestic. The man was to a considerable
extent a recluse, but whenever he had occasion to leave his home after
nightfall, which was seldom, his housekeeper would immediately make
haste to visit a friend. She declared that nothing would induce her
to stay in alone at night, because of numerous uncanny noises and
especially certain dismal groans proceeding from some never fully
revealed part of the house. Coincidentally with the death of the owner
these spookish manifestations ceased. Many long years have passed
since that time and the house is still standing in good preservation.
It has been occupied by different families during this time and only
the oldest inhabitants remember that at one time it was regarded as
harboring a ghost.

All the actors in this tragedy or comedy have long since passed away,
but the legend persists as one of the most unique old-time mysteries of
New England.

The skeptical reader might easily dismiss the foregoing history as
being in all probability the result of too much imagination and rural
credulity, but those who vouch for another story of \xE2\x80\x9Chants\xE2\x80\x9D are still
living and their testimony is absolutely beyond question.


The Sudden Discontinuance of the \xE2\x80\x9CSpirit Raps\xE2\x80\x9D

A young couple with an infant child occupied a typical New England
house located on a thriving farm. The house was in a good state of
preservation and the residents were healthy and normal in every
respect. Their sleeping room, however, became widely noted among their
acquaintances. It was fairly infested with \xE2\x80\x9Cspirit raps.\xE2\x80\x9D

The exhibit was usually about as follows: Soon after retiring and while
perhaps getting into the drowsy stage that borders upon dreamland, a
series of raps would suddenly start on the ceiling and pass diagonally
across the room. After moving from the farthest corner the raps would
gradually seem to come down the wall at the head of the bed, at which
point raps would be heard on the wooden headboard and upon the pillows.
This occurred on numerous occasions and became quite a nuisance.

One evening the young couple went to bed unusually fatigued from a hard
day\xE2\x80\x99s exertions. Just as they settled down to sleep, the raps started
in louder than usual. Exasperated by these unwelcome noises, the
husband suddenly expressed his mind. He told his wife that he wished
those certain kind of spirits would go back to Hades where they came
from and let him sleep.

It was not surprising that he should have lost patience, but it was
surprising that the raps did then and there cease, never again to be
heard.

       *       *       *       *       *

Another old-time story of the mysterious was told by a young woman
whose Puritanic regard for strict veracity was almost a joke to her
friends.


The Supernatural Illumination

With her young child in the cradle, she was sitting in the early
evening in a room which looked out upon an open space of ground
including the driveway. Save for the child, she was absolutely alone
in the house. It was a very thick, starless night, threatening rain.
At her back as she sat in the darkness, resting from her labors and
thinking that she must get a light and do some sewing, there was a
window almost entirely hidden by vines which were allowed to shade that
part of the room, there being other windows to furnish light.

Suddenly there flashed on the wall before her a bright reflection of
the vine-covered window, the frame standing out clear and distinct as
though there were no vines at all. She looked at this reflection with
great astonishment a moment, sprang to her feet, opened the door and
started out on the porch which commanded a complete view of the entire
front of the house and the open field beyond. There was not a sound nor
a sign of anybody abroad. It is asked in the Scriptures if a woman can
forget her sucking child, but in this instance she could, for she ran
down the road like a wild thing to a nearby house, where she secured
the companionship and moral support of a kindly old woman, and returned
for the protection of her sleeping infant.

To the present generation these tales of the supernatural would be
generally regarded as rubbish. Those who lived in years of maturity a
half century ago would hardly be inclined to so classify them. On the
contrary, they would regard them as unsolved mysteries existing at the
time, often amusing and seldom terrifying. Let those of that era be the
judges.




CHAPTER VIII

TALES OF RURAL LAWYERS AND THE COURTS


The fact that there are many amusing fiascoes in running through the
regular grist of rural court cases should not in any way reflect upon
the personnel of the members of the legal bar. The section in which
most of the following incidents occurred has been noted for a century
for the exceptional ability and commanding personality of its lawyers.
But any attorney engaged in general law practice is continually turning
up something which, if commonly known, would be regarded as ranking
high in the field of humor.

       *       *       *       *       *

An attorney, who during his career became widely known throughout the
country in general, was for a long time active in practice as a country
lawyer in a little town. No case was too great or too little to command
his attention.


The Litigating Horse Dealer

Among his clients was a farmer who was also engaged in horse trading.
It might perhaps be said that horse trading was his principal
occupation. This man was an enthusiast. Any horse he happened to own
was a living wonder. He sold horses, but most generally his method was
to exchange his own for some other horse, each of the parties of the
trade trusting to their wits to get the better of the other.

As this man, whose first name was Oliver, was extremely fluent
regarding the merits of his horses, there were frequent cases in which
the party of the second part was disappointed. When the new owner would
compare the horse itself as revealed to him by actual contact and
use, with the glowing recommendations of the dealer at the time the
trade was made, righteous indignation would often lead to a demand for
satisfaction. In such cases he would receive no consideration whatever
and if he had the real genuine spunk of the period, he would engage a
lawyer and begin legal proceedings at once.

This was at a time when petty litigation was extremely frequent and
encouraged by the legal profession. Pacifists were not in fashion and
those who were too dignified to settle disputes with their fists, would
maintain their self-respect by starting a lawsuit. This class of court
cases is pretty generally frowned upon at present, as the standards
of the legal profession have advanced steadily the past century,
maintaining a close parallel with the similar ethical development of
the medical profession.

When Oliver became involved in one of these occasional disputes, he
would promptly refer the matter to his attorney, who generally managed
to extricate him from even the most unpleasant situation. There was one
occasion, however, when this eminent attorney was almost inclined not
to act.

After an unusually successful horse trade, Oliver one day appeared at
his attorney\xE2\x80\x99s office with a rather grave face.

\xE2\x80\x9CSaul,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI traded horses with a man over on Scrabble Hill and
he is all stirred up about it. He has put the matter in his lawyer\xE2\x80\x99s
hands and thinks he is going to be able to make out a strong case.
What do you think I better do about it?\xE2\x80\x9D

The lawyer regarded the matter calmly. It was hardly necessary to ask
any questions. The details of such transactions were apt to bear a
strong similarity in different trades.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat can you prove?\xE2\x80\x9D he asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CHang it! Saul!\xE2\x80\x9D said Oliver. \xE2\x80\x9CIt isn\xE2\x80\x99t a question of what I can prove;
it is what I have to prove.\xE2\x80\x9D

The attorney, therefore, although not especially edified at this kind
of professional routine, proceeded to give Oliver an outline of the
kind of testimony that he should be able to produce to offset the
righteous claims of his opponent. Tradition says that Oliver was nearly
always prepared to furnish the evidence, having some very accommodating
friends and neighbors.


The Attorney Who Scorned Divorce Business

In a certain locality in northern New England there was a journeyman
tinsmith who was nearing his thirtieth birthday. This young man,
although possessed of much natural wit and ingenuity in argument, had
never exhibited any desire to better his position. A young girl, of
seventeen or eighteen years, aroused his ambition and he decided to
study law. His mind absorbed information like a sponge, and by teaching
school during the day and studying at night, he was able to prepare
himself for what proved to be a very satisfactory examination for
admission to the bar. His success was immediate. Marrying the girl who
had inspired him to a higher walk in life, he became a brilliant figure
in the legal annals of this period.

At the height of his career his wife died, and just as he had never
manifested the slightest interest in any other girl prior to his
marriage, he was equally indifferent to all other women after the death
of his wife. But apparently to overcome moments of black depression
which assailed him out of business hours, because of his tense grief at
the loss of his wife, he gradually acquired intemperate habits. Then
followed a strange record for a thoroughly modern court, of frequent
cases called in their regular order, quietly transferred further down
the docket list, because of the murmured report of some tipstaff
to the judge that \xE2\x80\x9CJim,\xE2\x80\x9D who was to try the case, was temporarily
incapacitated. Such was the personal regard in which this man was held
that there seldom was an instance where an opposing attorney made any
objection.

[Illustration: A TYPICAL NEW ENGLAND ELM]

Not inconsistent with the foregoing history, was the absolute refusal
of this lawyer to ever have anything to do with divorce practice.
Knowing his contempt for that class of law business, an elderly man one
day climbed his office stairs and appeared before the eminent lawyer.
There ensued a conversation about as follows:

\xE2\x80\x9CJim,\xE2\x80\x9D said the old gentleman, \xE2\x80\x9CI have come to see if I can\xE2\x80\x99t engage
you to help me get a divorce from my wife.\xE2\x80\x9D

The lawyer glared at him and then detecting a humorous twinkle in the
old man\xE2\x80\x99s eyes,

\xE2\x80\x9CHow long have you been married?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

\xE2\x80\x9CFifty-two years,\xE2\x80\x9D was the prompt reply.

Lighting a fresh cigar from the stump of an old one, as he was almost a
continuous smoker, the lawyer promptly dismissed the matter.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, sir; I shall not undertake to get a divorce for you. But you may
go home and tell your wife that if she wants a divorce, I will be glad
to act for her and it won\xE2\x80\x99t cost her a penny.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

The early history of a certain state was associated with considerable
difficulty in establishing a distinct separate existence. The early
settlers therefore became unusually well informed in the general
principles of the juris-prudence of that period. Naturally they did not
allow much time to pass after their state organization was assured,
before establishing a system of county courts.


The Murderer Who Was Not There That Day

In one of the counties there was all the machinery for carrying on
a considerable court business, but affairs were so exceptionally
peaceful that there was very little for the court to do. It was
therefore a matter of pride to the inhabitants of that county when it
became necessary to try a real red-handed murderer.

The judge had little, if any, experience in murder trials, and felt the
importance of the occasion quite seriously. There was great general
interest during the trial and the court room was packed. At last the
case was ready for the jury which filed out, soon returning with the
verdict of guilty. The judge arose and directed the prisoner to stand
before him.

\xE2\x80\x9CPrisoner at the bar,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CYou have been tried by a jury of
your peers, and let us hope, superiors, and have been found guilty of
the crime charged against you. I therefore sentence you, etc., etc.,\xE2\x80\x9D
repeating the usual formula, of which the substance was that he should
be hanged early in the spring following the present session of court,
which was in the late autumn. Then recollecting himself, he said to the
prisoner:

\xE2\x80\x9CIs there any reason why the sentence should not be imposed upon you?\xE2\x80\x9D

The prisoner who had assumed a bored attitude throughout the entire
trial, manifested but languid interest.

\xE2\x80\x9CI dunno as I have anything to say, except that I don\xE2\x80\x99t expect to be
there that day.\xE2\x80\x9D

He was not there that day. The jail was a ramshackle affair at best and
the prisoner, after apparently enjoying the hospitality of the county
during the extreme cold months of the winter, made his getaway a week
or two before the date set for his execution, and was never heard from
again.

       *       *       *       *       *

Perhaps at no time in the history of a certain rural valley was the
legal profession more appreciated than it was following a public
hearing to, if possible, determine who was responsible for an epidemic
of incendiary fires.


A Celebrated Arson Case

Within a relatively few weeks, several sets of unusually fine farm
buildings were one after another destroyed by fire. There was an
incipient reign of terror developing. Farmers all began to wonder who
would be the next victim and little else was talked about in local
gatherings.

Another fire occurred, and it was decided that something must be done.
Finally a public hearing was announced to take place at an early date
and an attorney who lived about ten miles distant was induced to act as
interrogator.

On the appointed date the hall was filled to overflowing as few who
were anywhere within the radius of the fire zone, considered it wise
to remain away. One by one those who had been in attendance at the
various fires were called upon to give their testimony. Finally a young
man was summoned to the stand who it transpired had been present at
every fire. The attorney who conducted the interrogation was a noted
cross-examiner. It seemed unusual to him that the witness before
him should have found it convenient to be practically the first man
at every one of the fires. His manner, however, was friendly and
reassuring and he asked a great many questions. Within fifteen minutes
the audience were looking at each other and nodding their heads.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s got the right man,\xE2\x80\x9D was the verdict.

The attorney, however, was too discreet to indulge in any dramatic
accusations. He dismissed the witness in the blandest manner, after
which the hearing was halted and a discussion among leading citizens
took place. An elderly man of considerable force and personality was
deputized to have a quiet conversation with the young man who had
just been cross-examined. The result in less than half an hour was a
complete confession. The epidemic of fires was over.

It seemed that the guilty man had at the beginning yielded to an
impulse to touch a match to a lock of hay which he saw protruding
from a barn in the outskirts of the village. The resultant fire and
excitement were apparently too much for a brain never any too well
balanced. He found the diversion caused by these fires necessary
to his existence. He was sentenced for a long term and died in the
penitentiary.

The years following the Civil War were productive of a certain type of
attorneys who were more effective with the juries of that period than
they are apt to be at present. They cultivated eloquence to the limit
of their abilities. An attorney who had been an officer in the Civil
War acquired quite a reputation as a spectacular pleader. Especially if
an old soldier was in any way involved in the case, his oratory reached
unusual heights.


The Attorney Who Justified \xE2\x80\x9CAssault and Battery\xE2\x80\x9D

An old veteran of two or three wars was on trial at the county court
for some form of physical assault. Ordinarily harmless, this old chap
would become very pugnacious at times, especially when under the
influence of certain fluids. In this case he had done considerable
damage to the personal appearance of someone in about his own walk in
life and of whom he did not approve. The aggrieved party engaged a
lawyer who succeeded in having the case put upon the court calendar for
jury trial.

The evidence was very damaging to the old veteran and as there seemed
to be no good reason why he should not be taught a lesson, a term in
jail seemed extremely imminent, until the attorney for the defense, the
officer above referred to, began his argument.

The lawyer was named Johnson, and after making the usual rambling
introduction, gradually entered upon a lofty train of thought. He
pictured the hero of the two wars as a man to whom the entire community
was indebted, and pointed out the fact that even his principal
weakness for strong drink was the result of his big heartedness and
fraternal spirit. Proceeding with this line of argument he succeeded
in convincing the intelligent jury that a man who objected to being
battered and bruised by such a hero was not only a poor loser but a
pretty cheap sort of man generally. The result was a verdict of \xE2\x80\x9Cnot
guilty.\xE2\x80\x9D

The old veteran was overwhelmed with admiration for his lawyer\xE2\x80\x99s
ability and his enthusiasm promptly found expression.

Turning to his wife, a withered up old woman of about his own age, he
said:

\xE2\x80\x9CHurrah! We can now go home and if we ever have a boy, we will name him
Thomas V. Johnson.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Lawyer Who Was Going to \xE2\x80\x9CGet Over It\xE2\x80\x9D

An attorney of unquestioned ability had but one failing and one which
was far too common among the legal profession years ago. He was a
periodic. At such times his naturally acute business judgment would
become rather unstable. Like numerous other lawyers of that period,
\xE2\x80\x9CWad,\xE2\x80\x9D as he was generally known among his friends, did some insurance
business as a side line.

\xE2\x80\x9CWad\xE2\x80\x9D was elected to the legislature and immediately took a prominent
place. He was an able debater and fluent speaker and exceedingly
popular. Coming to the capital city from a week end trip to his home,
it was immediately evident that he had been indulging a little too much.

Soon after his return on this occasion Wad wended his way to a certain
insurance office to make a series of settlements for collections
he had made in his home town. As soon as the treasurer saw him he
recognized the situation, but being personally fond of the man, he
hoped to get through with the matter without any complications.

It soon became apparent, however, that Wad was in no condition to
settle any accounts. The problems of addition and subtraction were
entirely too much for him. The treasurer watched with mingled sympathy
and contempt his impotent efforts to group the necessary figures, but
finally lost patience.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou come in some other time, Wad,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CThere is no hurry. You
can just as well settle this matter some other time.\xE2\x80\x9D

The attorney paid absolutely no attention to this suggestion and
continued his erratic tussle with the illusive figures. The treasurer
who was extremely busy that day, and a model of methodical precision in
business details, was thoroughly disgusted.

\xE2\x80\x9CWad,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou\xE2\x80\x99re in no condition to do business today. You\xE2\x80\x99re
drunk. Come in when you get sober and we will settle.\xE2\x80\x9D

The exaggerated dignity of the man \xE2\x80\x9Cunder the influence\xE2\x80\x9D immediately
asserted itself.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I\xE2\x80\x99m drunk and you\xE2\x80\x99re a d----d fool; I shall get over it and you
won\xE2\x80\x99t!\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

The small town which may perhaps chiefly by reason of geographical
location be the county seat, always livens up when the county court is
in session. There are always a few cases sufficiently unique to arouse
general interest. But there were real thrills at a certain court on one
occasion because of the approaching trial of a real genuine bank robber
who had been apprehended after he had committed a real crime. The
community seemed to some of the inhabitants to be getting thoroughly up
to date.


The Story of the Wily Bank Robber

The prisoner was an up-to-date crook without a doubt. He was a
professional and wanted elsewhere, but the court in question was
permitted to have the glory of \xE2\x80\x9Csending him over the road.\xE2\x80\x9D

The trial was a perfunctory affair, and aside from the testimony,
which was somewhat exciting in spots, there was nothing to provide any
special entertainment for spectators. The prisoner was sentenced for a
term of years, and remanded to the county jail to await the convenience
of the sheriff before being taken to the penitentiary in another town.

The session of court ended shortly after, and there was no further
cause for delay in placing the prisoner where he could put on the
stripes. Arrangements for transfer were made to take place on a certain
nearby day.

At the county jail it had been noted that the prisoner had been very
much cast down by his conviction. He was listless, showing little
desire for food and was extremely pale. Before the day set for his
removal it became a question whether he would long be able to make the
journey. It was therefore decided to remove him at once.

Accompanied by the sheriff, the prisoner, properly handcuffed, was
taken to the train, which after a few miles, was to pass through a
stretch of mountain timberland and on a heavy grade. As the train was
approaching this wilderness, the prisoner requested permission of the
sheriff to go to the wash room. His mildness and apparent natural
amiability together with his extraordinary weakness had aroused the
personal sympathy of the sheriff. So he promptly removed his handcuffs
and granted his desire, taking his own stand by the door, according
to custom. On the heavy grade the train naturally went slowly. The
prisoner had slipped the bolt as he went in and nothing further being
heard from him the sheriff rapped on the door. There was no response.
After a few such attempts to arouse the prisoner who had apparently
fainted from weakness, it was decided to force an entrance. As may be
naturally expected, the window was open and the prisoner was gone. The
train was halted and an immediate search was made and the alarm spread
far and wide. Nothing was ever heard of the prisoner again.

The mystery of the sudden extreme pallor and weakness was soon
afterwards solved. A search of the cell recently occupied by the
prisoner disclosed a couple of wads of so-called fine cut chewing
tobacco which those wise in criminal annals promptly connected with
the escape. The prisoner had bound these wads of tobacco under his
arm pits and it was the absorption of nicotine thus resulting which,
theoretically at least, had produced the symptoms which had so aroused
the sympathies of the sheriff.


The Legend of the Pine Tree

The fondness for litigation, especially among certain farmers in olden
times, became almost a monomania in some instances. For many years
there resided in a tumble-down house on a little farm, a man who with
his wife was perhaps as near an approach to poor mountain white as can
be found in the New England states. And yet the story had it that he
had at one time been a prosperous farmer in one of the most fertile
valleys of his state.

According to the legend this man and a neighbor became involved in a
dispute as to the possession of a certain large and lofty pine tree
situated on the boundary line of the two farms. The quarrel eventually
developed into a lawsuit which was continued from term to term by
well-known dilatory tactics of that period. Each of the parties in the
dispute had employed able legal counsel. Eventually both of the farmers
became bankrupt after exhausting their means in continuing the legal
struggle.


The Man Who Wanted to be \xE2\x80\x9CSociable\xE2\x80\x9D

In another instance a man possessed of the same mania for legal contest
had gradually seen his property absorbed by a capable lawyer. To him he
always referred his numerous disputes. When the aggressive litigant was
unable to pay money, the attorney would arrange for settlement by note.
The notes were transferred into a mortgage and finally the mortgage was
foreclosed.

At the general windup of affairs certain farm animals, which were a
part of the few visible assets remaining, were sold at auction. It
might be expected that the belligerent lover of lawsuits would have
been somewhat cast down under those circumstances. But he was game.

At one time, however, it became necessary for the auctioneer to
admonish the man who, although afflicted with an impediment of speech,
was seen to be in earnest conversation with a prospective bidder. It
was assumed by the auctioneer that he was giving out tips as to which
cows about to be sold were most desirable. In an aggressive tone,
calculated to be heard by all present, the auctioneer called out:

\xE2\x80\x9CLook here, Mr. Thomas! You keep your ideas about these cows to
yourself!\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man turned about to look at the auctioneer a moment, then with
a whimsical glance at the spectators stuttered out his response as
follows:

\xE2\x80\x9CD--d--dammit; can\xE2\x80\x99t a m--m--m--man be sociable?\xE2\x80\x9D




CHAPTER IX

SOME EXPERIENCES OF THE YANKEE TRAVELING SALESMAN


When it gradually dawned upon the country merchant that by dealing via
the mails with responsible wholesalers and jobbers of the cities, it
might not be necessary for him to spend a week or two several times
a year going to \xE2\x80\x9Cmarket,\xE2\x80\x9D it incidentally became apparent to the
wholesalers and jobbers in question that it might not be a bad idea to
visit the merchant in his own store and stimulate his ambition to try
out new goods of new styles and designs. The result was the development
of a very unique type, the traveling salesman or \xE2\x80\x9Cdrummer.\xE2\x80\x9D

Perhaps the most conspicuous of these tourists was the grocery
salesman. It was necessary for him to interview his trade about every
thirty days in order to keep designing rivals from stealing away
his customers. As there was a profit in the business, the number
of wholesale houses increased, and likewise the number of their
representatives. There gradually developed a very intense competition
for all kinds of trade.

The commercial traveler was necessarily a man of optimism and usually
endowed with a capacity to endure much physical fatigue. It was lively
work covering a good, fair sized territory every thirty days. Naturally
it became increasingly difficult for a novice to establish himself in
the face of such intense competition.


The Hopeful Young Beginner

A young man who had acquired roseate views of the possibilities of
making a fortune as a grocery salesman, started out to cover a new
route. Visiting a group of towns in a certain state, he found the
merchants were all exceptionally well supplied with everything he
himself had to offer, but with courage unabated he kept on, believing
that when he arrived at a nearby thriving town with several active
dealers, his luck would change.

Reaching this town on a late afternoon train, he hastened to the most
prosperous grocery store. The proprietor was just about to leave the
store to \xE2\x80\x9Cgo to supper.\xE2\x80\x9D He, however, paused to listen with a wearied
air while the young man introduced himself, explaining that he expected
to travel over that territory every four weeks from that time on and
hoped to be able to serve him. The merchant finally spoke:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou say you expect to come here once a month?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do,\xE2\x80\x9D was the hopeful reply.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said the merchant, with a twinkle in his eye. \xE2\x80\x9CI think you
ought to do well; there have only been thirteen grocery drummers here
today.\xE2\x80\x9D

The young man\xE2\x80\x99s enthusiasm was somewhat dampened.

       *       *       *       *       *

One of the bugbears of the New England traveling salesman who must
cover his route at frequent intervals, is the midwinter blizzard. It
often requires a good many card games to fill in the waits. These
episodes are not without amusing details, but one of these unwelcome
events developed little that was humorous.


The Sick Engineer in the Next Room

Late one winter afternoon, two salesmen left a nice comfortable
hotel in a little town because the path of duty led them to take a
narrow gauge road up into the mountains. It was getting dark, had
been snowing heavily all day and the wind was just beginning to take
part in the program, frisking the feathery snow, here and there, just
to show what an innocent thing a winter breeze can be. But when the
train had gotten out of the way from the valley town and was making
its laborious way up a steep grade into the mountains, the real force
of the wind began to be apparent. The cars would rock back and forth
on their narrow carriages, but as there was no record that they had
ever actually capsized, everything was cheerful enough in the smoking
car. After a few miles, progress began to be very slow, as drifts
had accumulated on the track. Finally a trainman came through and
said that \xE2\x80\x9CJim\xE2\x80\x9D was in mighty bad shape and he didn\xE2\x80\x99t know whether he
could stick it out to the end of the line or not. Certain questioning
brought out the fact that \xE2\x80\x9CJim\xE2\x80\x9D was the engineer who had a high fever
and was almost delirious. The air became colder and colder and the
wind increased. After several hours, however, the short run of thirty
miles was accomplished and the two travelers started for the hotel. It
developed, that the hotel was not ostensibly open for business, the
proprietor having become peeved at repeated searching parties working
in the interest of prohibition. One of the travelers, however, knew the
ropes and led the way around through the back kitchen where the low
browed graduate of a New York dive, who conducted the tavern, was found
and he reluctantly agreed to provide rooms, though they proved to be
absolutely without heat.

One of the travelers immediately went to bed, having the foresight to
take his fur coat with him for extra covering, but he did not sleep
well. The train crew had succeeded in helping the engineer through the
drifts to the hotel and established him in a room adjoining that of
the salesman. The rooms were communicating and although the door was
closed, there was a wide crack at the top. All night long, under the
faithful administrations of the local doctor, the heroic engineer who
had stuck to his post and pulled his train through under conditions
that would tax all the faculties of a well man, was battling for life.
He proved to have an acute form of pneumonia. The night finally passed
and the salesman was able to get out of town from which point he went
to headquarters in a neighboring city to report. A few days later,
being back on the job once more, he saw a funeral cortege coming from
the railroad station. They were carrying the body of the engineer.

       *       *       *       *       *

To the salesman who visits his trade at frequent intervals, life is
chiefly made up of customers and hotels. The amusing experiences which
every commercial man has are, however, chiefly associated with his
various hotel homes. To be able to establish oneself for the night
at a cozy hotel where it is allowable to call the clerk and the head
waitress by their first names, provides relief from the intense mental
concentration necessary in bringing various customers around to the
salesman\xE2\x80\x99s way of thinking.


What Happened in the Hotel Barber Shop

The salesman who takes frequent trips is, as before stated, eventually
in a position to call everyone in a hotel establishment by their first
names, the hotel barber being no exception. One such barber became very
widely known to travelers because of his genial qualities and quick
wit, as well as his efficiency in carrying on his trade. It was only
the occasional visitor to his shop who failed to call him \xE2\x80\x9CDan.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDan\xE2\x80\x9D not only enjoyed the popularity of the traveling fraternity,
but was regarded with high favor by the prominent citizens of the
town, most of whom were regular customers. While the atmosphere of the
barber shop was cheerful, \xE2\x80\x9CDan\xE2\x80\x9D was careful to make sure that there
was nothing in that same atmosphere that would be in any way offensive
to his more conservative clientele. With unusual skill he was able to
give his shop a somewhat clublike atmosphere which of course helped
business.

One day a very discordant element obtruded itself. A well-known, but
not greatly admired, local citizen familiarly known to the villagers as
\xE2\x80\x9CHen\xE2\x80\x9D was having one of his periodical drinking spells. Rambling about
in his customary aimless manner under such conditions, he suddenly
made his appearance in the shop. A bank president was in the chair and
another well-known citizen was \xE2\x80\x9Cnext.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDan\xE2\x80\x9D gave a quick glance at the intruder, who obviously had no
business purpose in coming there, and detecting his condition at once,
he told the inebriate man in bland but decisive terms that he better
move along. \xE2\x80\x9CHen\xE2\x80\x9D was not in a frame of mind to be reasoned with and
showed no intention of moving out. He addressed his conversation
indiscriminately to all who might be present, much to their annoyance.
But \xE2\x80\x9CDan\xE2\x80\x9D was equal to the emergency. Suddenly laying down his razor,
he stepped quickly to his overcoat which was hanging on a peg and
took from one of the pockets a leather pipe case. Wheeling about and
pointing the pipe case at this astonished intruder, he said:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou get out of here, quick; or I\xE2\x80\x99ll shoot you right in your tracks!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHen\xE2\x80\x9D was no hero, drunk or sober, and he fled in consternation to the
other end of the village.

       *       *       *       *       *

Visiting the country stores of New England in wintertime, often
provides startling contrasts in the way of hotels. The traveler who
spends Tuesday night at a thoroughly modern commercial hotel in a town
of 5000 inhabitants, can spend Wednesday night in a similar hotel, if
he is traveling in summer via auto. In winter, however, he may find it
difficult to arrange for these comforts.


The Salesman Who Was Given a \xE2\x80\x9CWarm Room\xE2\x80\x9D

A salesman for a western firm who enjoyed the comforts of life, was
quite disturbed one evening to find himself in a small mountain village
and destined to stay over night at an old-fashioned hotel. This
old-time tavern was one of the oldest buildings in that section of
the state and much the oldest of all the hotels of that region. It was
built of brick, with small windows and high window sills, the glass
being small panes of the Revolutionary period. The sleeping rooms were
but narrow cells leading off from a long, dark corridor.

The outdoor temperature was about 20 degrees below zero, and as this
hotel had no steam heat, each room being warmed separately, the
salesman made a very vigorous demand for a fire in his bedroom. He was
promptly assured by the landlord that he should have a fire and a warm
room.

Stopping at the hotel was a traveling troop of Indian performers, the
male members of which camped out in the old-time dance hall on the
second floor. The salesman, who had not slept very well the night
before, went to his room early. He found an old-fashioned box stove
which was just beginning to throw out a genial heat. He felt very well
satisfied with himself that he had made his demands known.

With the door closed, the temperature of the small room soon passed
the genial stage. It became intense. The salesman therefore hastened
to open the window, believing that a little 20 degrees below zero air
would just about balance the overtime efforts of the stove. He found
the lower part of the window sash so thoroughly fixed into a bed of
ice that it was immovable. He therefore concluded that if he opened
the door into the hall, it would make things about right. This he
accordingly did and went back to bed. He was just dozing over when he
heard a rustling at the door. He looked out into the dimly lighted hall
to see one of the \xE2\x80\x9Cbucks\xE2\x80\x9D belonging to the Indian encampment looking
curiously into his room. He therefore concluded that it would be wiser
to close the door, as his confidence in the absolute integrity of the
members of the troop was not of the Fenimore Cooper type.

Having closed the door, the salesman then attempted to go to sleep,
but it was impossible. He arose and opened the stove door and made a
careful study of the contents. He found a large green chunk of wood
well coaled over and apparently capable of sustaining an abundance of
heat during the night. A high pitcher sitting in an old-fashioned bowl
contained some water and the luxury loving traveler succeeded finally
in slackening the fire to such an extent that he was able to get
several hours sleep.

The hotel was of very considerable interest as a historical landmark,
but it can be taken for granted that the picturesque history of this
hostelry was not appreciated by the traveling salesman.

       *       *       *       *       *

Modern conditions prevail with the country hotels of northern New
England at present. Only a few winters ago, however, a salesman who
opened a window of his steam heated sleeping room for air and then woke
up to find the faucet in his room frozen, was promptly presented with
a bill for damages the next morning by the landlord. It may be said,
however, that this hotel is not typical. There are numerous country
inns throughout New England which are comfortable in the coldest days
in winter.


Story of the Itemized Expense Account

A veteran hardware salesman, named Ed Stone, made two trips a year
among his wide circle of customers. He was genial, efficient and
popular, and was regarded as a valuable asset by his employers. The
oldest member of the firm, quite well along in years, was very prone to
petty economies. Looking over some of the travel accounts of several
salesmen representing the firm, he came to the conclusion that it would
be well to have them itemize their expense accounts. As Ed happened
to be at the store, he promptly advised him of the new policy. The
salesman who knew the peculiarities of the old gentleman, assured him
that it would be perfectly satisfactory to him to make out a detailed
report.

Starting out the next week, about one of the first points to be reached
was a small city where Ed had always been tolerably sure of a big
order. The store was conducted by an old-time merchant who had been
gradually pushed into the background by his aggressive and far less
competent son. While there were whispers that the firm were heading in
the wrong direction, their credit was still excellent.

So to the young man of the firm, Ed extended the fraternal hand, but
soon found that \xE2\x80\x9CTommy,\xE2\x80\x9D the son, was not in a genial humor. Business
was very poor, he was told. They had plenty of goods and would skip
the usual spring order. Further parley seemed to promise no results,
\xE2\x80\x9CTommy\xE2\x80\x9D showing symptoms of irritability.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Ed, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m sorry you feel that way, but I cannot see any
reason why you should not come down to the hotel and have supper with
me tonight. Like enough we will find a couple of the boys there and can
have a game of whist.\xE2\x80\x9D

After some persuasion, \xE2\x80\x9CTommy\xE2\x80\x9D accepted the invitation, appearing at
the hotel soon after the store closed, where he enjoyed as sumptuous a
dinner as the ingenuity of Ed could devise. Later on they went to Ed\xE2\x80\x99s
room, but there is no occasion for any further details, as everything
which transpired can readily suggest itself to any normal imagination
by the item which appeared in Ed Stone\xE2\x80\x99s expense account for that day.

    \xE2\x80\x9CFebruary 26th

    To getting Tommy Wilson into a frame of mind so that he would
    order his usual spring bill of goods.... $20.00\xE2\x80\x9D

Shortly afterward Ed Stone\xE2\x80\x99s circumlocutions brought him near enough to
the main office so that he ran in over Sunday and handed his expense
report to the senior member of the firm. The latter looked it over with
great interest for a few seconds and then turned to Ed:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, Mr. Stone,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat does this Wilson item mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

Ed smiled.

\xE2\x80\x9CI think,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll have to leave that to your imagination.\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man, who was a good citizen and a church man in regular
standing, swallowed hard and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! Well! I guess you need not bother to itemize your expense
reports any more.\xE2\x80\x9D


\xE2\x80\x9CTwo Barrels\xE2\x80\x9D

A great asset to the traveling salesman is individuality, especially if
it is of the constructive type.

A bakery and confectionery firm had a star traveling salesman who
covered a wide range of territory. Somewhat advanced in years, he
gradually became afflicted with an impediment in his hearing.

There is often tragedy in some gradually developing infirmity like
deafness, but it did not prove necessary for the firm who employed
Henry S--to make any change. They were very well satisfied to let Henry
stay on the job year after year, until he became quite an old man.

Henry always could be depended upon to get orders. Of course his
success in quite a large measure was due to his friendly personality
which made him cordially received wherever he went.

There are tricks in all trades and Henry became famous for one which
caused many a smile, not only among the storekeepers, but the traveling
profession as well.

Whenever in doubt, because of defective hearing, Henry always assumed
that his customer was talking business. A star feature of his line was
a certain brand of homemade crackers.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t believe I need any crackers today, Henry,\xE2\x80\x9D said the
storekeeper, raising his voice.

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo barrels, did you say?\xE2\x80\x9D said Henry.

The merchant laughed and nodded his head. He knew he could get rid of
them sooner or later and Henry was a thoroughly good fellow.


The Old Man Who Was Inveigled Into a Poker Game

In a certain New England town, two hustling citizens bought an old
hotel which with certain renovations and alterations, soon became an
attractive resort for commercial men. And while new customers flocked
to the old hotel, the old rural patrons also proved loyal and the hotel
did a thriving business.

One evening three enterprising commercial men began looking about for a
fourth partner for the purpose of going into retirement for a little
tussle with the god of Chance; in other words, they were to play poker.
No one turning up to take the fourth place, their attention was called
to an elderly man with white hair and a long white beard, who seemed
to be quite active for his years and, more as a joke than anything
else, they invited him to take part in the game. The old gentleman in
question lived on a farm and came from a very rural district, therefore
according to the usual precedents, he should be expected to gasp with
horror at the prospect of being decoyed into a gambling game with three
thoroughly up-to-date young travelers. Somehow he did not seem to be
disturbed by what the game developed into soon after he had taken his
seat.

The traveling men were well supplied with expense money and as they had
naturally expected from his moderately prosperous appearance, the old
gentleman seemed also to have plenty of funds. The contest lasted far
beyond the time when the elderly gentleman with the long white whiskers
might be expected to retire to rest, but he did not seem to be visibly
affected by the late hours. The game finally terminated in time to
give the commercial men two or three hours of very necessary sleep,
after which they had their breakfast, negotiated various small loans
to secure expense money and went their several ways. The hotel porter,
naturally cognizant of everything that happened in the hotel, tersely
explained the entire matter in the following words:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy Lord! Say, do you know that old chap with the white whiskers? He
just cleaned those fellows out of every cent they had!\xE2\x80\x9D

To those who knew the \xE2\x80\x9Cold gentleman,\xE2\x80\x9D whose hair became snow white at
a little past thirty and who carried that same luxuriant white hair
until he was eighty years old, the above incident is but a glimpse of
his many sided characteristics. He could be as generous with those
who needed friendly sympathy as he could be merciless with those who
attempted to overreach him.




CHAPTER X

TRADITIONS OF THE RURAL CHURCH


The New England pioneers who penetrated the unbroken, trackless forests
searching for suitable locations for future homes and who spared no
physical effort in establishing these homes, would have regarded
with contempt, if not with horror, the present day tendencies toward
shorter and shorter hours of labor. For in their dictionary the term
\xE2\x80\x9Crecreation\xE2\x80\x9D was practically unknown.

No new settlement could be regarded as fairly established until it
possessed a schoolhouse and a church. Naturally this involved much
extra labor and personal sacrifice.

So the New England tourist of the present day is constantly finding
these little old-fashioned emblems of self-denial tucked away, not only
in small hamlets but at the cross roads. The influx of numerous people
of different foreign nationalities and of the different religions, has
in many instances left the churches a difficult problem, financial and
otherwise, to the limited number of communicants yet remaining of the
old New England stock.

Before so many of the younger generation became ambitious for city life
and left the home farms to pass into the hands of strangers, these
churches were very active centers of culture and uplift.

However, with human nature as it is, it could hardly be expected that
there should not be some trying incidents connected with the close
intimacies of the country congregation. The new pastor soon found that
each of his parishioners had a very distinct individuality which was
often calculated to jar upon other individualities of his flock. The
nerve strain incident to preserving harmonious relations under these
conditions was no doubt responsible in numerous instances for the
\xE2\x80\x9Cnervous dyspepsia\xE2\x80\x9D which has so frequently afflicted country ministers.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the early days when barter rather than cash was the chief means of
exchange, the parson\xE2\x80\x99s salary was necessarily small, at least in actual
cash. To make up to him what they were unable to deliver in the way
of real money, the pastor was made the subject of countless acts of
generosity in the form of loads of wood, potatoes, pork and various
other elements of family subsistence. However, the crowning act of
generosity on the part of parishioners was the annual Donation Party.


The Story of the \xE2\x80\x9CRaised\xE2\x80\x9D Biscuits

In a certain parish there was a clergyman whose family did not take
very kindly to these rural substitutes for real money. Probably the
minister\xE2\x80\x99s wife had \xE2\x80\x9Cseen better days\xE2\x80\x9D before she became the partner of
a struggling country pastor. And quite likely she may have expressed
her disapproval of the stingy characteristics of some in the parish in
the presence of her children.

The annual Donation Party at this parsonage was a great success in
point of numbers, but the donations themselves were rather small. Each
matron of the community was of course expected to furnish her share of
the refreshments. Probably there was not sufficient team work in the
\xE2\x80\x9CLadies\xE2\x80\x99 Aid Society.\xE2\x80\x9D At any rate, the pastor\xE2\x80\x99s wife found herself,
at the conclusion of the evening\xE2\x80\x99s festivities, in possession of an
extraordinarily large number of exceedingly durable \xE2\x80\x9Craised biscuits,\xE2\x80\x9D
the other donations being far below the proper standard.

It became necessary for the pastor and his wife to visit an adjoining
town the next day, their children being left behind. During the absence
of the parents there were developments which scandalized the entire
neighborhood and filled the pastor and his wife with horror.

Shortly after their parents went away the children got busy. The
residents of the neighborhood passing the parsonage during the day
noted with mingled amusement and indignation the fact that each one of
the wooden pickets surrounding the ample enclosure of the parsonage was
surmounted by a raised biscuit.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a very hot Sabbath, but the faithful residents of the parish
were practically all in attendance. The parson accepted even the most
extreme views of the tense theology of that period. Therefore the
faithful mothers of the congregation arose early in order that they
might prepare all the children of walking age and upwards to appear
in clean clothes and clean faces by the time the last bell stroke was
heard.


The Small Boy Who Scandalized the Congregation

In accordance with the custom of that period, there were no free pews,
except for the extremely poor. The owner of each of these sittings
after carefully packing his family away in the limited space available
for that purpose, closed the door of his pew.

As before stated, it was a very warm day and little \xE2\x80\x9CJabe,\xE2\x80\x9D who for
some family reason or other was at present living with his three maiden
aunts, came to church attired only in his gingham shirt and cotton
trousers. Jabe was not old enough to appreciate the solemnity of the
occasion and it was beyond his understanding how people could be so
foolish as to be willing to sit perfectly still for two mortal hours
in church. Therefore, when he found that his attendance at church
was inevitable that morning, he looked about to provide himself with
diversion for the long period of hateful inactivity. The maiden aunts
were very devout. They gave their entire attention to the parson.
Except to occasionally lay a restraining hand on the \xE2\x80\x9Cwiggling\xE2\x80\x9D urchin
who was stationed between them, they seemed to have forgotten him.

In the pew immediately behind little Jabe and his aunts, there were
several young girls. Even at this time it was often necessary to frown
upon the effervescent spirits of girls in their teens. It can therefore
be readily understood how horrified and scandalized were the \xE2\x80\x9Cpillars\xE2\x80\x9D
of the church, when in the midst of the service, one of these young
ladies squealed hysterically. The minister ceased his discourse and
one of the deacons hastily demanded an explanation, which even in that
austere congregation seemed to be not only satisfying but amusing.
Little Jabe on his way to church, loitering behind his faithful aunts,
had spied a small snake on the roadside, pounced upon it and tucked
it inside his little gingham shirt. When the pastor had got well along
in \xE2\x80\x9Cfifthly,\xE2\x80\x9D Jabe had taken the snake by the tail and allowed his
head to emerge from his shirt front with the above named disastrous
consequences to the dignity of the morning service.

       *       *       *       *       *

Without doubt the first essential for the success of the country pastor
is the diplomatic instinct. He may be lacking in many other ways,
and yet continue to retain the good will and support of his parish,
provided that he can get in intimate contact with his people without
wounding their peculiar sensibilities.


The \xE2\x80\x9CDriveling Idiot\xE2\x80\x9D

A well-known clergyman, who was extremely popular in several parishes,
tells with much delight, his experience with a certain amiable old lady
who received him very cordially one day when making pastoral visits.

This minister was a comparative newcomer in the community and had
never had an opportunity to really make the acquaintance of the
lady in question. The conversation covered the normal range of small
town subjects, the lady showing very considerable interest in the
minister and his prospects and becoming more and more affable as the
conversation continued.

Finally it became the proper thing for the minister to gracefully
withdraw, which he did despite the urgent protest of his hostess to
linger a little longer. As he was about to take his departure, she gave
him a most approving look and dismissed him with the following words:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am so glad we have had this little visit. I am sure we shall all
like you ever so much. Do you know you greatly remind me of the
minister who was here when my husband and I first went to housekeeping.
He died a driveling idiot.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

In a remote village there was located a clergyman who divided his
energies between two small parishes. Diplomacy was not his strong
point. Probably not one-third of his hearers were communicant members.
And under his austere ministrations, many who were fairly regular in
their attendance showed a marked reluctance to allow themselves to be
enrolled officially.

In consequence of this unwillingness to assume church responsibilities,
the pastor held very pessimistic views as to their probable future and
did not hesitate to make it fairly clear and definite when occasion
permitted.

A great opportunity came to him and it may be truthfully said that he
made the most of it.


The Love-Cracked Suicide

Away back in the hills there was a young man of nineteen or twenty who
had become greatly interested in a somewhat frivolous maiden of sixteen
years. Psychologists of the present would have probably pronounced
Jim\xE2\x80\x99s development as about equal to that of ten or twelve years. He was
distinctly defective mentally, but a good worker on the farm and of
generally amiable tendencies. Theology to him was as remote a topic as
Babylonian literature.

But Jim had very definite views as to this girl. He was infatuated to
the point of desperation.

The young lady in question considered it a great joke. One evening she
would be very bland and agreeable and the next time Jim appeared, she
would be very much the reverse. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the
details which are too familiar to most people to require explanation.
She was having a beautiful time tormenting poor Jim. One evening she
carried it a little too far and Jim left her convinced that life was
not worth living. Retiring to a lonely hilltop with a heavily loaded
shotgun, he departed this life with almost incredible rapidity.

This unfortunate event created a wide sensation. Overwhelmed with
remorse, the young lady could not sufficiently abase herself.
Therefore, when the funeral was held in the little country church, she
appeared first among the mourners, although there is not the slightest
probability that she would ever have married poor Jim had he lived to
continue his courtship.

Knowing Jim\xE2\x80\x99s amiable qualities, all of the community were sympathetic
except the pastor. To him this situation presented the opportunity of a
lifetime.

The keynote of the funeral discourse was soon made apparent by the text:

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Paul cried with a loud voice: Do thyself no harm.\xE2\x80\x9D

Whereupon the astonished congregation found that instead of having
gathered to hear words of sympathy for the family bereaved by the
insane act of a love-crazed youth, they were to hear words of
condemnation and vituperation with direful warnings of eternal misery.

The more intelligent people listened with disgust, while those who
seldom, if ever, entered the church, looked on with amusement. With
the completion of the services, the people gladly withdrew from the
ministerial presence and when safely outside, their general views were
summarized by the comments of the local cobbler.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, the parson certainly had it in for poor Jim; he held him out
over Tophet for about an hour and then kicked him over in!\xE2\x80\x9D


\xE2\x80\x9CThere is a Lion in the Way\xE2\x80\x9D

On a certain July Sabbath the afternoon service in the little church
seemed to drag. There had been a long morning service, and a session
of the Sunday school earlier in the day, so it perhaps may not seem
surprising that some of the congregation were seen to nod at times and
then with renewed effort, concentrate their attention upon the minister.

The pastor of the parish was greatly beloved for his personal
characteristics, but not greatly admired as a preacher. His oratorical
process consisted of slow, rambling talks in a low monotone
intermingled with occasional emphatic remarks in a very loud voice.

The breeze which had been coming through the open windows died away and
the congregation became more and more drowsy. The pastor, amiable and
considerate, was the last preacher in the world to resent somnolence on
the part of his audience.

The sermon progressed and the pastor\xE2\x80\x99s thought was being slowly and
laboriously laid before the few who were still awake. When he found
it consistent with his system of discourse, he often projected an
allegorical picture upon the mental processes of his hearers.

Suddenly raising his voice until it echoed and re-echoed throughout the
edifice, he shouted:

\xE2\x80\x9CBut there is a lion in the way!\xE2\x80\x9D

A rustle passed over the congregation and all the drowsy ones sat up,
some few looking around hurriedly in various directions but becoming
speedily reassured.

The fact that a combined circus and menagerie was advertised to exhibit
in a nearby town within a few days might possibly have had something to
do with the unexpected success of the pastor\xE2\x80\x99s allegory.

       *       *       *       *       *

The enrollment in a certain community church was relatively small
because of a diversity of the religious beliefs among the various
families. Those who did not belong to the faith represented by the
minister were indisposed at that period to accept membership in the
church, even if they might be fairly regular in their attendance and
assist in the church financially. Others, of course, were indifferent
altogether.


The Man Who Borrowed \xE2\x80\x9CArabian Nights\xE2\x80\x9D from a Christian Woman

A man, naturally bright, but of limited education, had an unusually
good excuse for not attending church. He had a very large family
which taxed all his energies to support, and was sadly lacking in
church-going apparel. One day, while at the house of a neighbor, he
asked the woman of the household, who was a conscientious church
worker, to loan him a book to read.

Thinking that this man might enjoy tales of the marvelous, the woman
loaned him a copy of an expurgated edition of \xE2\x80\x9CArabian Nights.\xE2\x80\x9D He took
the book away with him and kept it for some time.

Finally one evening he brought it back. When asked if he had read the
book through, he said he had read part of it, but it had troubled him.
Asked for a more definite explanation, he expressed himself as follows:

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cto tell the plain truth, I was shocked when I started
reading. I could not understand how any Christian woman could loan me
such, a pack of lies as there is in that book!\xE2\x80\x9D

All of which well illustrates the different standards of the Victorian
period as compared with those of the present day.

       *       *       *       *       *

The congregation of a certain New England church, especially the
feminine portion, were full of appreciation, admiration and sympathy
for one of the deacons.


The Woman Who Was Not Going to be a Pack Horse

This man wore a constant expression of submission and meekness. He
was an exemplary citizen in every respect and was faithful in his
attendance to the duties of his office.

There was a special reason why the women of the church so highly
approved of the deacon. It was reported that his wife was very
impatient with him.

Gradually there developed an atmosphere of coldness toward the wife,
more than counter-balanced by the sympathetic friendliness toward her
husband. This was somewhat irritating to the lady in question, who
so far as she knew had never transgressed any of the general laws of
society nor of the church. After a while the deacon\xE2\x80\x99s wife became very
unreconciled at the situation and from dwelling upon the matter she
became probably more irritable than a deacon\xE2\x80\x99s wife should be.

One day some unfortunate event led this woman to express herself more
freely to her husband than she had done for a long time. As usual he
accepted her remarks with docility and calmness.

The deacon went to his room and the wife went about her tasks in a
tumult of dissatisfaction with herself and the entire situation. She
recalled legends of the deacon\xE2\x80\x99s early life which indicated he was of
a very high temper. If he had only said something in self-defense, the
situation would be more bearable. Shortly afterward she had occasion
to go up stairs and as her felt slippers made little noise, she
approached the conjugal chamber unnoted. Hearing the sound of her
husband\xE2\x80\x99s voice, she stopped at the nearly closed door to listen.

The deacon was engaged in prayer and she listened to hear him express
his thanks that although a wilful, perverse person, he had been
permitted to have a cross to bear, or rather a thorn in the flesh
in the form of his wife, in consequence of which he could develop
patience, endurance and the various divine virtues.

The deacon\xE2\x80\x99s wife listened to the foregoing in amazement and then it
all dawned upon her. Pushing open the door and quickly confronting her
astonished husband, she said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI understand it all now. Perhaps you think I am going to be a pack
horse to carry you to Heaven, but you will find out differently.\xE2\x80\x9D

The legend says that the subsequent amiability and angelic sweetness
of the wife eventually caused the deacon to appear almost irascible at
times.

Among the regular attendants at a little country church, were a rather
attractive, enterprising young lady and a very bashful young man.


The Enterprising Deacon Who Proposed at the Grave

As may often be observed, under such circumstances, the vivacious young
lady possessed great attractiveness in the eyes of the young man, but
held back by his natural diffidence, he failed to make his admiration
definitely known to the girl. She was not lacking in other admirers and
so it happened that when the young man in question finally developed
sufficient courage to ask the young lady to marry him, he was informed
in the most gracious manner that while she had always esteemed him
highly as a friend and might have even had a greater interest in him, a
more self-confident rival had secured her promise to marry him.

The young man was naturally very much cast down. The apparent admission
on the young lady\xE2\x80\x99s part that his answer might have been different had
he been a little more prompt in making his wishes known, was especially
depressing to him.

A few years passed and the young woman, who had apparently lived
happily with her husband, was unfortunately left a widow. Her former
admirer decided that he would not be backward this time, but just
as soon as any decent period had passed, he would resume paying his
addresses and thereby forestall any of the other eligibles of the
community. He called upon the young woman and was graciously received
and thus encouraged proceeded to carry on his courtship with a vigor
and enthusiasm that to his own highly developed sense of the fitness of
things, seemed to border upon impropriety. Finally he brought matters
to a climax by again offering his hand and fortune to the blooming
widow. Greatly to his chagrin he was informed, as before, that she was
promised to another man.

This was hard luck indeed and the disappointed wooer was almost
inclined to resort to that quite common rural expedient and marry some
other girl \xE2\x80\x9Cout of spite.\xE2\x80\x9D But somehow this did not seem to square with
his conscientious scruples and in fact there was no other girl about
who seemed to attract him. It was a depressing situation indeed.

But, as sometimes happens, she who had been maid, wife, widow and again
wife, once more became a widow. The twice disappointed devotee decided
this time there would be no delays due to a fantastic sense of what was
suitable and proper.

Accordingly the very next evening he called to see the doubly bereaved
woman. She met him very cordially and his hopes arose high. Feeling
that he had already made his regard for her sufficiently clear so that
there need be no time lost in preliminaries, he gave but a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99
consideration to discussing the weather and other common topics before
proceeding to the matter at hand. He asked her to marry him.

The young woman gazed at him sympathetically a moment and then murmured:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am so sorry but I am already engaged; Deacon Harris proposed at the
grave!\xE2\x80\x9D




CHAPTER XI

TALES OF RURAL THRIFT


There are probably few better schools for the development of thrift
than the small New England farm, which although necessarily limited
in its capacity to produce an income, still requires a considerable
investment in necessary equipment. Those courageous, hard working
couples who bring up a family upon one of these small homesteads, find
it exceedingly hard to make ends meet and may quite likely often find
themselves at the end of the year in the state of mind shown by the
humble tiller of a Vermont farm who when asked what kind of a season he
had had, replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot say that we have made any money this year, but we have got
considerable growth on the young ones.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Old Friend and the Load of Hay

For many years a family had subsisted upon a small farm which was a
source of profit chiefly to a money lender some fifteen miles distant
and made secure by means of a very energetic mortgage. It mattered not
what the family necessities might be, provision must always be made on
the first day of April for the payment of the interest.

One April first, when \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Aaron\xE2\x80\x9D had traveled the fifteen miles
laboriously through the mud to make his annual payment, he seemed to
the holder of the mortgage to be somewhat depressed. As he was normally
a very cheerful man, the money lender asked him how things were going.
He was informed that \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Aaron\xE2\x80\x9D was exceedingly short of hay with
which to feed his stock until the grass in his pasture had made
sufficient start to justify his turning his cattle out to seek their
own living.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! well! Uncle Aaron,\xE2\x80\x9D was the reply. \xE2\x80\x9CI have a whole barn full of
hay at my farm up the Branch and you can take your horse and wagon, go
up there and get a load for your cattle and it won\xE2\x80\x99t cost you a cent.\xE2\x80\x9D

Uncle Aaron made his way homeward with a light heart. To be sure the
roads were in a fearful state, but his old mare was faithful and
reliable and he felt sure she could make the journey and take home a
pretty fair load of hay for his lean and always expectant cows.

A couple of days later with his horse and hay wagon he made the
journey, securing as much hay as he thought his horse could get home
with over the muddy roads. Apparently Uncle Aaron overestimated the
old mare\xE2\x80\x99s capacity, as when he was yet six or eight miles from home
she seemed to have lost all courage. He could hardly get her along the
road. Finally he remembered that at a farm a short distance ahead,
there lived an acquaintance of his who would probably be glad to put
him up for the night. He succeeded in persuading his reluctant horse to
cover the remaining distance and turning into the farm road observed
his old friend looking at him curiously, but who quickly approached and
welcomed him gladly.

\xE2\x80\x9CJust drive into the barnyard,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cand put your horse in a
stall, give her some supper and then we will go in the house. My wife
will be glad to make your acquaintance.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was indeed a haven of rest for Uncle Aaron. With the old mare well
fed and furnished with a comfortable bed of straw to sleep on, as his
friend had plenty of straw, although he admitted being very short of
hay, Uncle Aaron accepted gladly the hospitality of his friend\xE2\x80\x99s wife
who served an excellent supper. Such cordiality was really delightful
after so weary a day.

The evening passed in reminiscences of boyhood days, and the occasion
was enlivened by several pitchers of cider which in turn recalled jolly
old songs in which \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Aaron\xE2\x80\x9D and his host joined with zest. It was
a late hour before the old friends retired to rest.

Uncle Aaron slept soundly and late. He was awakened to hear with horror
the clock striking nine. Breakfast must have been over at least two
hours, if not more. Leaping from the bed, Uncle Aaron hastily proceeded
to dress, but his attention was called to a chamber window by the
bellowing of cattle. Looking out he saw his host halfway across the
field engaged in some farming task, while a large herd of cattle were
in the barnyard eagerly consuming what seemed to be about the last
of his load of hay. Hastening from the house and chasing the cattle
back into the meadow, where they had evidently been eagerly searching
for an occasional bite of dead grass, Uncle Aaron accepted a late
breakfast with numerous apologies to his hostess, harnessed his horse
and dejectedly turned his way homeward. The load which the old mare had
occasion to haul over the still sticky roads, did not seem to be much
of an embarrassment the rest of the way home.

The sad feature of this melancholy tale, to Uncle Aaron, was the ever
present doubt as to the real good intentions of his old friend in
turning his hungry cows into the meadow that morning and leaving the
gateway insecurely fastened.

       *       *       *       *       *

The ambitious proprietor of a small farm is naturally somewhat
perturbed when winter finds him with insufficient forage for his stock.
It means that he must go to the expense of buying supplies from his
more fortunate neighbors, or that he must sell some of his cattle at a
sacrifice.


The Man Who Worked a Confidence Game on His Cows

The owner of a little mountain farm found himself as winter approached
with a shortage of hay, but more dry straw than usual. The question
therefore was how to enthuse his cattle with the idea of making one
good, substantial meal per day of the straw. It should be understood
incidentally that the grain had been threshed out of this straw,
leaving just the residue, which from the standpoint of the average
experienced bovine citizen was exceedingly unpalatable.

The experiment was tried of feeding straw to the cattle in the manger
in the way hay was fed, but with very unsatisfactory results. The cows
nosed over the straw with badly concealed disgust. When it became
necessary to feed hay, practically all the straw had to be removed. It
was a discouraging situation but Yankee ingenuity, which has so often
stood the test, did not fail in this instance.

Taking into careful consideration the exceedingly complex psychology
(?) of the average cow, the owner had a very bright idea. He hastily
pitched a large quantity of straw out into the barnyard where the
cattle went out to drink, making as high a pile of it as possible; this
he surrounded with a rickety fence.

The next day, at the normal time for the straw ration, the cattle were
turned into the yard, and gazed curiously at the straw pile. Watching
at some distance, the farmer saw one or two cows approach the stack and
thrusting their heads through the ramshackle fence, nibble cautiously
at the straw. The owner promptly rushed into the yard and chased the
cattle away.

Again the farmer watchfully waited, noting with gleeful enthusiasm the
marked change in the attitude of his cattle toward the straw. That
which had been scorned by them when fed as a legitimate ration, now
seemed to assume new and seductive attractions.

He again drove them away and went to his house for the noonday
meal. When he returned an hour or two later the temporary fence was
completely demolished, while the unusual abdominal distention of his
flock of cows gave abundant evidence of the success of his experiment.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are few legends of unusual thrift which come down out of the past
involving the medical profession. The country doctor has usually worked
hard, gone without sleep, trusted patients to whom no one else would
think of giving credit, and died poor.


\xE2\x80\x9CStew \xE2\x80\x99Er Down\xE2\x80\x9D

There were exceptions, however. A doctor who had for many years enjoyed
a fairly lucrative practice and who had shown unusual efficiency
in holding his expenses at a low figure, gradually found himself
handicapped by the infirmities of age with a naturally diminishing
professional income.

Although the old doctor was in affluent circumstances for that period,
it was very depressing to him not to be able to lay aside the usual
amount each year. He accordingly resorted to the extremes of economy.
The doctor lived alone except for a housekeeper, and having had a
misunderstanding with her, found himself left entirely to his own
devices. He accordingly engaged a half-grown boy to come and stay with
him and \xE2\x80\x9Cdo chores for his board.\xE2\x80\x9D

The boy did not find the environment especially exhilarating. The old
man was very irascible and hard to please. Furthermore his menu was
rather too simple to meet the requirements of a growing boy.

One evening returning from school, the young man hustled to do his
outdoor tasks in order to prepare for an early supper. He had even
more than his normally excellent appetite. In fact he was practically
famished. He hoped therefore that the old doctor would give
instructions for a tolerably elaborate meal.

But he was greatly disappointed. Seating himself near the kitchen
range, the old doctor who commonly held his cane in his hand, even when
sitting in his easy chair, testily gave instructions to the boy to
make a hasty pudding, prepared of course by sifting fine cornmeal into
a kettle of boiling hot water until the right admixture is made, and
then allowing it to cook for a short time.

According to the instructions, the youngster soon had the kettle
boiling and brought forward an ample supply of the cornmeal, the old
man watching every movement. Taking spoonfuls of the meal in one hand,
he stirred vigorously with the other, meantime sifting in the meal. In
his eagerness to prepare a sufficient quantity of the food to satisfy
his youthful craving, the boy had put an unusual amount of water in the
kettle. But when he had sifted in about half enough meal to produce the
requisite combination with the water, he was abruptly brought to a halt
by the old doctor.

\xE2\x80\x9CHold on there, boy!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CYou have enough meal in there. Stew \xE2\x80\x99er
down.\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man\xE2\x80\x99s word was law and there was nothing for the youngster to
do but to speed up the fire and stir the contents of the kettle until
the evaporation of the superfluous water had brought the food mixture
to the right consistency.

The boy decided that in the interest of self-preservation he had better
hunt for a new job.


\xE2\x80\x9CNever Mind, I Can Cut It\xE2\x80\x9D

Probably no more elaborate form of thrift has ever been carried out
than that of the old-time widow of small fortune and the determination
to live on her income. One of this type of widows succeeded in making
herself a social leader among a considerable circle of women who were
in much more comfortable circumstances financially. The airs and graces
of this old lady were not looked upon with special admiration by the
men of the community, but when an exceedingly amiable married woman of
the neighborhood was invited with her husband to have supper with the
widow, she prevailed upon her reluctant husband to go with her.

They were received cordially by the hostess who gave most gracious
attention to the husband. He was not especially responsive and his wife
looked on with considerable anxiety lest he should somehow allow his
disapproval of the widow to show out in the conversation.

Everything went smoothly, however, and the amiable wife began to feel
quite at ease. Called to the dining room, the table was found to be
set out in very attractive style and lavishly supplied with everything
except things to eat. The food exhibit was exceedingly meager.

They took their seats and the old gentleman gruffly replied to the
prattle of the widow and seemed to be making a pretense of enjoying his
meal.

Finally, however, that occurred which the wife had feared, and she felt
disgraced for life.

As the final artistic touch of the meal, the widow turned to the pie
which was apparently destined for dessert, cut it with great precision
exactly through the center, next dividing one of the halves into three
exactly equal parts. She then passed the pie to the amiable wife
aforesaid, who removed one of the geometrical portions with the grace
and ease customary on such occasions. The widow then passed the pie to
the husband.

Perhaps the old man was actually in that state of undernourishment
which produces such dissatisfaction in the masculine mind; perhaps he
was inspired by a sardonic sense of humor. What he did was to reach out
and take the half pie yet uncut and remove it to his plate. His wife
looked on with horror.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, papa,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat part of the pie is not cut.\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man smiled at her grimly.

\xE2\x80\x9CNever mind,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CI can cut it.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

The impression should not be acquired that New England thrift and
stinginess are synonymous. A person can be very economical and still be
generous and considerate.


The Empty Flour Barrel

A young married woman, whose husband was not regarded as a very good
\xE2\x80\x9Cprovider\xE2\x80\x9D and who had been housekeeping a year or two, was quite
flattered one afternoon at receiving calls by two estimable old ladies
of the neighborhood. It may be taken for granted that they knew pretty
nearly all the facts regarding the young couple in question. And their
disapproval of the husband was about equally balanced by their sympathy
for the wife.

After devoting an hour or two to conversation with her guests, the
young housekeeper excused herself in order that she might prepare the
five o\xE2\x80\x99clock supper. Styles of entertainment naturally change according
to the times, but at that period no farm supper table with guests
present would be considered as properly spread without an abundant
supply of hot soda biscuits which would be made more palatable by
serving some kind of fruit sauce.

Shortly after the young hostess had set about her task of preparing
supper, a pounding was heard in the kitchen. The two old ladies looked
at each other significantly. The pounding continued. The hollow sound
could suggest but one thing. The housewife was making a desperate
effort to gather up enough flour from a nearly empty barrel to make the
biscuits _de rigeur_ for supper.

The old ladies became more and more uneasy and the conversation died
away. Finally one of them arose.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know, I\xE2\x80\x99m going home! It doesn\xE2\x80\x99t seem to me as though I could
swallow a mouthful of one of those biscuits. That poor thing doesn\xE2\x80\x99t
have half enough to eat!\xE2\x80\x9D

While the other lady was hesitating, the hostess re-entered the room.
She of the uneasy conscience had already put on her wrap. The hostess
protested but with no results. Her decision being unalterable, the
other guest decided that it would be more diplomatic for her to make
an excuse also. And the ladies departed to their homes, each of them
more disgusted with Jake\xE2\x80\x99s improvidence than before they had apparently
encountered the direct evidence that his poor wife must be going hungry.

This was many years ago and probably not even millionaires now buy
their flour in barrels. But just because poor \xE2\x80\x9CJake\xE2\x80\x9D had been a little
slow about finding the wherewithal to lay in perhaps a year\xE2\x80\x99s stock of
flour for himself and wife, in one package, his wife\xE2\x80\x99s social status
received a serious jolt.

       *       *       *       *       *

Under the strictly home rule township system of the New England states,
only the large towns have their own resorts for the \xE2\x80\x9Cdown-and-outs\xE2\x80\x9D
known as \xE2\x80\x9Cpoor farms.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Town Pauper Who Made an Epigram

The small towns have from the most remote days generally arranged to
have the chronic town pauper boarded out in some family. Naturally
people in comfortable circumstances are not likely to furnish
entertainment for these unfortunates, who are generally farmed out by
the year in homes where the very moderate compensation for board would
be of financial assistance in meeting the year\xE2\x80\x99s expenses.

\xE2\x80\x9CUncle Hiram\xE2\x80\x9D had recently been transferred to the care of a family
which was not noted as given to a luxurious menu. There was no doubt
sufficient food, but it was very plain and \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Hiram\xE2\x80\x9D was naturally
somewhat of an epicure.

One day he appeared at the residence of the poor master and seemed to
be more dejected than usual. Suspecting that something was wrong, the
official began to ask questions.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Uncle Hiram, how are you getting along at your new home?\xE2\x80\x9D

Uncle Hiram was rather non-committal in his reply, seemingly reluctant
to make complaints, but after some urging he proceeded to make his
ideas clear in the following long remembered statement.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Thomas\xE2\x80\x99s folks are very good folks; but they have everything ter
buyee; and nothin\xE2\x80\x99 ter buy it with.\xE2\x80\x9D

As there was no evidence that Uncle Hiram did not fare as well in the
menu as the rest of the family, it was not considered necessary to try
and hunt him up a new boarding place.


The Conscientious Neighbor Who Ran An Account

It is a common belief that excessive thrift is a continual temptation
to dishonesty, but such is not necessarily the case. Perhaps there is
no more marked example of that exactitude in business transactions
which so frequently leads to the charge of stinginess than the instance
recorded of the obliging man who was asked by his neighbor to kindly
extend a little helpful supervision over the efforts of his young boys
to carry on the farm during his own necessary absence for a few weeks.
He offered to pay liberally for all the time required in carrying out
this plan.

The man cheerfully consented to do all he could for the youngsters
while their father was away.

The boys being carefully instructed as to their duties in his absence,
the father started on his journey well content that everything would
be all right. On his return he found that all had worked out as he had
expected.

The farm business had gone smoothly and when the obliging neighbor
presented his bill, carefully itemized, it was promptly paid and with
much pleasure.

The bill was carefully preserved as a souvenir for many years. It
comprised a considerable number of items, each representing some small
service for which the charge was accordingly trivial. Of course it is
impossible, and neither is it desirable, to go into details regarding
this bill, but one item may give a clue as to the conscientious,
methodical and business-like habits of the man who presented it.

That which has appeared heretofore in this chapter illustrates the
various phases of the habitual economy which has made the Scotch, the
New Englanders and other nationalities take so leading a place in
modern civilization. But there is another instance of the economical
instinct which stands out in very unpleasant contrast with the
foregoing.


The Thrifty Man Who \xE2\x80\x9CSwore Off\xE2\x80\x9D Using Tobacco

A well-to-do farmer had reached quite an advanced age and had been
recently left alone by the death of his wife. He had no children and no
obvious reason for denying himself anything within reason that would
help to allay his natural loneliness. But such a hold had frugal habits
taken upon him that one December he resolved that on January first he
would discontinue for all time his one indulgence, _viz._, \xE2\x80\x9Cfine cut\xE2\x80\x9D
tobacco, utilized in the manner made famous and conspicuous by many
eminent Americans during the preceding century.

Accordingly, having reached this decision, this model citizen began to
plan ahead. He found that his supply of \xE2\x80\x9Cfine cut\xE2\x80\x9D was in considerable
excess of his normal requirements. He therefore speeded up the matter
somewhat by increasing his daily allowance. But when the thirty-first
day of December arrived, he found himself with several days\xE2\x80\x99 supply on
hand.

There were acquaintances who would on request have cheerfully obliged
him by taking over his reserve stock. But this plan made no appeal. He
resolved to sit up until midnight, if necessary, and consume the last
of that \xE2\x80\x9Cfine cut\xE2\x80\x9D himself.

He carried out his plans according to program. But even his thoroughly
seasoned physique rebelled. The next day he was seriously ill. And his
funeral took place a week or two later.




CHAPTER XII

CHEERFUL TALES OF NEIGHBORLY INTERCOURSE


The impression may be easily acquired by the reader that the collector
of these authentic reminiscences is inclined to look with favor upon
those whose personalities are exhibited in these pages. Such an
impression is probably correct as it is not human nature to comment too
sarcastically upon that which adds to the joy of life.

In the average conservative rural neighborhood of New England, it is
regarded as excellent policy to cultivate the semblance of cordiality
in neighborly associations with special regard for humorous intercourse
whenever possible because people of even more than average human
frailty may have occasion to do kindly acts. Therefore, it is seldom
that neighborhood friction becomes openly demonstrative.

The boy or girl who has been raised in an atmosphere of forbearance and
who has been taught to avoid any outward display of personal dislike,
has acquired a very useful lesson. This may explain to a certain
extent the ability of the transplanted Yankee to avoid antagonisms in
neighborhoods in which there may be, generally speaking, less personal
restraint.


\xE2\x80\x9CAm I Ben Jackson, or Am I Not?\xE2\x80\x9D

It would have been perhaps natural for a certain Ben Jackson to have
resented what happened to him one sultry afternoon, but so far as
the record shows, if he had any such feeling he kept it carefully to
himself.

Ben Jackson had been to town a few miles away with a load which he
delivered with a yoke of oxen attached to a primitive cart of earlier
days. At that time it was but the most natural thing in the world that
there should have been included in Ben\xE2\x80\x99s purchases at the country
store, a bottle of rum. It must not be understood by this that Ben was
an intemperate man, for such was not the case. Like nearly everybody
else of that era, including deacons, clergymen, as well as Indians, he
considered that his health and that of his family required that they
have \xE2\x80\x9Csomething in the house\xE2\x80\x9D at all times.

On his way home with an empty cart and a docile pair of oxen, progress
was necessarily slow. A man who rises at three or four o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the
morning in order to put in a fair day\xE2\x80\x99s work before nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the
evening, has an excuse for becoming drowsy at times of inaction. Ben
had sampled the rum, found it good and tried it again, after which,
knowing that his oxen would probably find their way through the coming
strip of woodland without any guidance from himself, he stretched out
upon the cart and was soon fast asleep.

In the meantime the oxen had leisurely picked their way through the
woods until they came to a little opening at one side of the road where
there was some green grass. Having no one to restrain their movements,
they turned away from the road and began to refresh themselves. Just
about that time two young men came along who knew Ben very well and who
promptly grasped the situation. The little opening at the roadside was
rather rough ground and they could easily picture the oxen tipping the
cart to such an angle that Ben would roll off and possibly be injured.
It was therefore but a naturally kind act for them to guide the oxen
safely into a little arbor, release them from the cart and leave their
friend to enjoy his nap in safety. Incidentally they decided to sit
down in nearby obscurity and watch developments.

Ben\xE2\x80\x99s nap lasted for considerable time. But finally a swarm of
mosquitoes aroused him to semi-consciousness. He was surrounded by
trees and the entire scene was vague and unfamiliar. It seemed to him
that it must all be a dream. He began to talk and his kind friends,
before mentioned, listened eagerly.

\xE2\x80\x9CAm I Ben Jackson, or am I not? If I am Ben Jackson, I have lost a yoke
of oxen. If I am not Ben Jackson, I have found a cart.\xE2\x80\x9D

It can be easily understood that the friends in ambush soon reassured
Ben as to his identity. Just how much of the rum was left when he
finally arrived home does not appear in the record.

It will be noted that in this instance a practical joke was played
upon an unsuspecting citizen which placed him in a ridiculous light.
However, if the same practical joke had resulted in anything like
personal injury or damage to property, it would have been met with
local disgust or indignation, all of which indicates merely inherent
common sense.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the more leisurely days it was the custom that friends or neighbors
meeting while driving on the highway, would stop their teams and have
a little chat in the roadway. An exchange of jovial banter under such
conditions was not only frequent but expected. As an example there was
the chance meeting between Mr. Peck and Mr. Wells.


\xE2\x80\x9CThe Farther You Go the Better They Are\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Peck, who had recently removed from his native town some dozen
miles away, was returning to his new home from a brief visit to
his former town and met Mr. Wells, an old neighbor, in the highway.
Being congenial acquaintances, there naturally followed a general
conversation in which Mr. Peck inquired as to the well-being of various
mutual friends. There was much for Mr. Wells to tell, and Mr. Peck
enjoyed getting all the news from his old neighborhood. It required
several minutes for Mr. Wells to lay before Mr. Peck these numerous
details. Just about this time a heavy team approached nearer and nearer
and it was necessary, in view of the narrowness of the road, for these
old friends to separate. As Mr. Wells started up his horse to move
along, he remarked:

\xE2\x80\x9CThere are some mighty fine people in our old town.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Peck, \xE2\x80\x9Cand the farther you go the better they are.\xE2\x80\x9D

The personal application of Mr. Peck\xE2\x80\x99s remark will be appreciated when
it is explained that Mr. Wells lived on the very first farm across the
boundary line in the town under discussion.

In these degenerate gasoline days, there is less opportunity for such
friendly exchanges of left-handed compliments. When the horse was
the chief mode of conveyance, the frequent watering trough afforded
occasional chances for the circulation of the perennial Yankee jokes.


\xE2\x80\x9CSay, Put the Doctor Ahead\xE2\x80\x9D

A man returning to his farm from a visit to the grocery store, in
waiting to give his horse a drink, fell in behind an unusual collection
of vehicles. At the head of the line with his horse\xE2\x80\x99s nose in the
trough, was a well-known undertaker. Directly behind, waiting for
his turn was a veteran dealer in tomb-stones. And next in line was
the village doctor. The man in the rear, who knew all the parties
concerned, could not resist the opportunity to make a suggestion.

\xE2\x80\x9CSay,\xE2\x80\x9D he called in loud tones to those in front. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99ve got this
procession dead wrong; you ought to put the doctor ahead!\xE2\x80\x9D

All this is but a part of the record of the past. The actors have all
passed on, but there are many more recent echoes of amusing happenings
along the country roads.


The Scrambled Eggs in the Highway

At the foot of a long hill, near the outskirts of a certain busy town,
the middle of the snowy road for a protracted period of winter cold,
presented the appearance of well scrambled eggs. In reality it was not
exactly an optical delusion either. A well-known farmer, who lived
considerably back in the hill country, started out one \xE2\x80\x98day in his
old-fashioned \xE2\x80\x9Cpung\xE2\x80\x9D sleigh to deliver to a local grocery store two
or three weeks\xE2\x80\x99 accumulation of fresh laid eggs. These were carefully
packed in a receptacle with a loose cover. Just as he was reaching the
foot of the hill near the railroad, a train suddenly darted into view
and while his horse was old enough to have become steady, he had never
become reconciled to the arrogant actions of a locomotive. He gave a
quick leap and in spite of the best efforts of his driver, succeeded
in dumping the contents of the sleigh into the middle of the road. The
slaughter of eggs was practically complete.

The conventional thing to say would be that the driver, who soon
controlled his horse, returned to his home a sadly disappointed man.
But this would in reality be a misstatement. The spectacle of thirteen
dozen eggs totally wrecked in the middle of the highway and the
prospective wonderment of passersby so stimulated the farmer\xE2\x80\x99s Irish
sense of humor, that he told the story with great delight to everyone
whom he could induce to listen to him. Naturally his attitude regarding
this untoward event might have been somewhat different had he been in
circumstances which made the loss of the eggs a matter of any real
importance.

       *       *       *       *       *

The occasional wrecked vehicle which may be seen by the roadside in
country districts is more likely in these days to be a gasoline buggy
than one drawn by horses. But one midsummer day not long ago, travelers
along a back country road observed with much curiosity what remained
of an old time buggy which indicated a bad case of misunderstanding
between some horse and its driver. Those who found out the facts were
considerably amused.


The Story of the Rebellious Horse

A prominent farmer in the neighborhood had somewhere acquired a horse
whose disposition had become permanently sour. This horse was not
satisfied to work eight hours a day, or six hours, or in fact to do any
work at all. She was on a permanent strike and inclined to sabotage.
Her owner therefore decided that there was no use in bothering any
longer and announced his intention of having the horse killed.

About a half mile away there was a young man who believed that he
possessed certain hypnotic powers, at least in the matter of horses. He
told the owner of the striker aforesaid that it was a shame to close
out as good a horse as that, whereupon the owner promptly made him
a present of the animal. The young man led the horse home and made
elaborate plans for a process of education and benevolent philanthropy
which would cause the rebellious equine to see things in an entirely
different light.

As the eccentric horse had a record of becoming too handy with her
heels, it was desirable to proceed with caution.

The early results of the ensuing course of treatment were encouraging.
The horse seemed to respond to the humane methods of the experimenter.
Every evening the horse received a lesson and finally was harnessed
and driven short distances on the highway. His new owner, however,
seemed to prefer seclusion for his experiments. At last he began to be
convinced that the horse\xE2\x80\x99s nature was entirely changed. He was elated
with the success of his efforts.

Finally he decided that the time was near when he could exhibit his new
possession by daylight. He looked forward with much anticipation to the
admiration with which his efforts would be regarded by all the young
men of his acquaintance.

Before making this public show of his horse, he concluded to give it
one more tryout. He had always driven with a stiff check rein which
held the horse\xE2\x80\x99s head very high. When a horse\xE2\x80\x99s heels go up, its head
goes down. After making a little detour on a comparatively level road,
he turned on to a stretch of road which led up a hill. When he had
nearly reached the top it occurred to him that it was a little hard on
the now reformed horse to make her climb where it was so steep with the
head held up so high. He stopped the animal, got out of the buggy and
unhooked the check rein. He resumed his seat in the buggy, gathered up
the reins and started the horse again. Holding the reins very firmly
he was, for a minute or two, able to keep the animal\xE2\x80\x99s head in nearly
the desired position. Then followed a struggle between the horse and
the driver which resulted finally in the horse depressing its head to
the right angle, after which there was a most remarkable bombardment
of rapidly moving heels which, according to the driver\xE2\x80\x99s subsequent
report, established a new record over anything he had ever yet heard
of. The horse trainer fortunately succeeded in escaping uninjured from
the vehicle, got the horse by the head, unfastened the straps, and ran
what was left of the wagon up on to the bank at the roadside, from
which point he led his horse home, thankful that the shades of evening
were such as to make his movements obscure. The horse regeneration
experiment was a failure.

       *       *       *       *       *

While the more remote highways of New England are anything but a joy
during certain months, they become more attractive as the fields and
woodlands assume their summer hues.


What Happened to the Junk Man

One of the first signs of well developed spring in the farming sections
is the appearance of the traveling junk man.

The conventional outfit required for this branch of commerce is a
substantial wagon of medium size and a horse of sufficient age and
discretion to stand patiently by the roadside while the driver dickers
for old metals, wornout rubber footgear and the surplus burlap grain
bags which are apt to accumulate on the average dairy farm. It is
probable that the real, conscientious traveling tourist of this variety
does not allow himself to profiteer to a greater extent than say 4000
per cent. As might be expected, these travelers are not regarded with
much enthusiasm, although they are allowed to carry away that which
otherwise would be a total waste.

One of these aggressively industrious people was making his rounds one
day and left his team in front of a farmhouse While he interviewed
the proprietor. Just at this point some men were repairing the road.
Although his negotiations occupied several minutes, he returned empty
handed, climbed into his wagon and moved along. Shortly afterward
he turned off the main thoroughfare on to a side road which soon
became quite steep. His faithful horse had never failed him so he
was surprised to have him falter. Finally, in spite of the driver\xE2\x80\x99s
agitated words of encouragement, the wagon began to back down hill,
landing in a ditch.

No damage was done, but it was all very mysterious to the junk man. He
could not understand what had happened to the horse. The animal did not
seem to be sick and had never been inclined to be balky. At last he
concluded to take an inventory of the load. Lifting a pile of ancient
burlap bags in the rear of the wagon, he discovered eight or ten large
boulders, each being about as large as two men could lift. It seemed
very amusing to the men working on the highway a short distance away
when the junk man by herculean efforts succeeded in dumping the rocks
out of the end of the wagon.


What Happened to Another Junk Dealer

On another occasion a young scion of a prosperous junk dealer started
out with a high powered automobile to make a quick collection of
burlap grain sacks which at that time were in demand at very high
prices. Naturally he did not care to pay much for these bags and he was
not taken very seriously by the up-to-date farmers whom he visited.
Passing into an unfamiliar section he asked the manager of a large
farm whom he had been annoying by his persistent methods, as to how
he could reach a certain neighborhood not far away where there were a
group of large dairy farms. He received directions and shortly after
appeared at one of these farms complaining bitterly of the state of the
highway. The man who listened to his complaint could not understand
why he had found such bad roads. A little questioning demonstrated the
fact that in his disgust at the unwillingness of the opulent junk man
to take \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D for an answer, the manager of the farm before mentioned
had directed him to take a crossroad which was considered locally as
practically impassable, even for a farm wagon. The commercial tourist
succeeded in making his perilous way across to a place of safety but he
narrowly escaped heart failure.

       *       *       *       *       *

To those of rural districts who seldom travel far from the home
fireside, there are suggestions of possible interest and entertainment
in conversing with strange frequenters of the highway. This was
especially true of earlier days when, because of frugal habits and
rather unsatisfactory public roads, unfamiliar faces in the highways
were few indeed.


The Inquisitive Man by the Roadside

It is not surprising therefore that when a real old gentleman who had
served his community and even his state acceptably in his more active
days, observed an absolute stranger walking rapidly up the road,
he should have meandered out to the front gate for a little closer
inspection.

The traveler was evidently in haste, but was brought up to a short turn
with an interrogation from the old gentleman that it would have been
very impolite to have ignored. Then followed a conversation which is
yet occasionally referred to after more than half a century.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou seem to be in a hurry today.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere did you come from?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI came from Monkton.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen did you leave there?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDay before yesterday.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere did you stay last night?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI stayed in Goshen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere are you going today?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to Jericho.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat are you going to Jericho for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to school.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA man as old as you going to school! What are you going to school for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to school to see if I can\xE2\x80\x99t learn how to mind my own
business.\xE2\x80\x9D

The stranger passed on and left the old man thinking it over. The more
he thought it over the more he was sure it was a good joke on himself,
and being a genuine Yankee, he enjoyed the joke just as well as though
it had been on someone else and it soon became well known to his
acquaintances.

       *       *       *       *       *

But while the interchange of civilities among near or more or less
remote neighbors who chance to meet in the highway, is quite prone to
touch upon the humorous episodes which are constantly happening to
normal human beings, there is occasionally a glimpse of the pathetic.


The Misfortunes of Mr. Foley

A man who had quite an extensive acquaintance in a certain section was
driving to town one day and at a turn of the road met a genial old
Irishman who was jogging his fat and sleepy old horse along toward
home. The two had not met for quite a while and the conversation was
much prolonged. After inquiring as to Uncle Jimmie\xE2\x80\x99s health and that of
his family, and the outlook for the hay crop and various other subjects
of mutual interest, inquiry was made as to some of Uncle Jimmie\xE2\x80\x99s Irish
friends. Finally Mr. Foley\xE2\x80\x99s name was mentioned. A shadow came over
Uncle Jimmie\xE2\x80\x99s face.

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! it is indeed sorry I am for poor Mr. Foley. First he lost the foal
of his mare; then he lost a sow and litter of pigs; and now, poor mon,
he\xE2\x80\x99s lost his wife.\xE2\x80\x9D




CHAPTER XIII

SAD TALES OF PRE-PROHIBITION DAYS.


It would seem to be eminently fitting to group the events chronicled
below in the Thirteenth Chapter of this History.

In the light of present day happenings and with the echoes of rage,
despair and lamentation filling our ears, it would be hard to imagine
the incredulity with which many worthy, and otherwise, patriots of a
former generation would have regarded the possibilities of the present
prohibition era. Indeed, there are many who now, looking back to
earlier days, can with relief affectionately recall various old-timers
who have passed on to another existence, and thus been mercifully
spared the desolate days which now follow each other in hopeless
succession.

However, there is such a thing as carrying pathos too far. So we will
let the scenes shift to a famous day in the history of Hank Towner.


The Return of a War Hero

No one in his native town had ever suspected Hank Towner of being a
hero. The ordinary pursuits of peace held little attraction for Hank,
at least that portion which involved real actual labor. To be sure,
there was plenty of reason why Hank should work every day, but there
were other reasons why he did not work except occasionally, and the
chief of these reasons was John Barleycorn.

However, this is a world of unsuspected opportunity, as Hank found out
for himself. This was many, many years ago, but as Hank persisted long
years after the supposed scriptural limit of seventy years, his history
remains vivid.

War was declared with Mexico, and about the very first to respond to
the call for volunteers was Hank. Military life appealed to him, and
he became a model soldier. This fact, however, made little impression
upon his fellow citizens who had known him so long under different
circumstances. His company marched away and the war went on and
although Hank was reported to be a good soldier, it seemed to his
former associates that there must be some exaggeration about it.

One day the town woke up. There had been a great battle, at least
great for those times, and wonder of wonders, one of their own boys
had distinguished himself and become a national hero. The newspaper
reports were read eagerly and in all details. Hank who was assigned to
a battery company, had remained at his post when his comrades had fled
and had single-handed held the enemy back with volleys of grape-shot.

The town was even more impressed when it was learned that Congress had
passed a vote of thanks to the distinguished soldier whose heroism and
unfailing nerve had saved the day.

Every citizen of this patriotic little town thrilled at this report. To
think that they had had a national hero grow up in their midst and had
never recognized the fact! They really felt ashamed to look each other
in the face. But they resolved if Hank ever got back to his home town
he would get an ovation such as had never been known in that valley
before.

The war came to an end. The troops were ordered home. It was time to
show their appreciation.

A meeting was therefore held and the leading citizens constituting the
Reception Committee were authorized to equip themselves with badges,
engage a band and declare a public holiday for the town, in order
that the distinguished son who had cast such glory upon even the most
conspicuous of the town\xE2\x80\x99s people should receive suitable testimonial
of the esteem in which he was held. This of course is but a meager
abstract of the gracious phrases of those who elaborated the reception
plan.

No railroad reached the town at that time and Boston passengers came by
stagecoach. Definite arrangements were however made by which it could
be known just what day Hank would arrive.

The auspicious day dawned bright and fair and business was practically
suspended. Long before the stage was due to arrive early in the
afternoon, the streets were thronged. The Reception Committee had
repaired to the principal hotel, at which point the stage was to
deliver the distinguished passenger.

Stagecoaches were run on an excellent schedule in those days. And at
about the time prepared for in the program, small boys who had climbed
the tall trees on the hotel lawn, announced in shrill tones that the
stage was coming. A thrill passed through the crowd. This was a day
to remember. And indeed it was. The driver of the six Morgan horses
attached to the stage with the long reins wound around his hands,
brought his equipage skillfully down the long hill and through the
covered bridge, from which point he passed down the street and around
the corner. The road was now straight to the hotel and the spirited
horses came down the street with a rush, drawing up before the hotel
portico with a grace which none but Morgan horses could ever equal.

The Reception Committee of distinguished citizens, wearing their high
hats and badges, now came impressively down the steps of the hotel
and formed in a semi-circle at the side of the coach. Some unfamiliar
passengers climbed down from the top and two or three women looking
exceedingly disgusted, got out of the interior of the coach. There was
an awkward pause. Then someone asked the driver,

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere\xE2\x80\x99s Hank?\xE2\x80\x9D

The driver pointed significantly toward the interior of the coach. The
spokesman of the Reception Committee stepped forward and looked.

Hank had arrived! He was lying in a stupor on the floor of the coach,
while the strong alcoholic odor which floated out upon the atmosphere
made all further questions unnecessary.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is often hard to decide whether the man who performs a kind deed
for his neighbor or the neighbor himself is the most benefited by the
friendly act. In the following instance it is evident that the chief
benefit derived was to the party of the first part.


The Motorist Who Was Good to Antoine

Antoine was a natural born hustler. No one knew better how to get
a bumper crop from his farm or how to drive a harder bargain in a
livestock transaction. His naturally rapid accumulation of assets,
however, was being constantly depleted by the apparent necessity on
his part of taking a few days off every now and then, in order that
he might sample various brands of wet goods. As there was not only a
considerable expenditure of cash, but a loss of time involved in these
holidays, they were expensive, even if we leave out the consideration
of fines imposed when Antoine\xE2\x80\x99s powers of locomotion had become totally
suspended.

It was therefore an unpleasant sight to a certain prosperous young
business man of the vicinity, when one afternoon, at the intersection
of two busy streets he beheld Antoine whom he had known a long time,
ambling along very plainly under the \xE2\x80\x9Cinfluence.\xE2\x80\x9D To the young business
man it seemed a shame that so naturally industrious and worthy a
citizen should be allowed to perambulate directly into the arms of a
cop, which seemed likely to happen in the very near future, and thus
very likely find it necessary to pay a fine before he could get back to
his farm.

These reflections were followed by a noble and generous impulse.
Calling to Antoine, he told him he was going in the direction of the
latter\xE2\x80\x99s farm and would be glad to take him home in his car.

Antoine promptly accepted the invitation, climbed into the car and in
a short time was unloaded, safe and sound, in his own door yard. He
expressed loquacious thanks for the favor which had been done and the
young business man went on to look after some incidental matters in the
vicinity, feeling greatly pleased with himself.

Antoine\xE2\x80\x99s farm was not far distant from the trolley system which took
him into the town from which he had just recently been delivered. When
the motorist had made his rounds and returned to the starting point,
and had run his car up to the curb, he looked up the street and rubbed
his eyes. Had the last two hours been a dream, or had he actually
performed a noble act? A look at his speedometer convinced him that he
had actually made the trip, however.

What he saw that was so confusing was Antoine just getting off the
trolley car. There had been just about time enough since he had been
taken home for him to meander down the road and catch the car for the
original starting point.

Antoine had come back to town to finish the job.

       *       *       *       *       *

To certain citizens there would seem to be something radically wrong
with society when prohibition officers will deliberately receive and
sometimes actually destroy \xE2\x80\x9Cgood liquor.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Tale of a Rescued Keg of Whiskey

It was a shock to Harry W-- years ago when he heard that there had been
a prohibition raid on a certain bottler of soda water and various other
colored fluids, during which several five-gallon \xE2\x80\x9Ckags\xE2\x80\x9D of whiskey,
gin and brandy had been dumped unceremoniously into the river.

It seemed as though something ought to be done about such a reckless
act and after some reflection Harry decided there could be. Hastening
down the street to the outskirts of the town, he entered a fringe of
bushes by the river bank and waited. Sure enough, shortly afterwards
down came two kegs, the bungs of which had been knocked out before
their emersion and which were wabbling along in the current.

Wading out into the stream, Harry succeeded in towing these two kegs to
the shore, and pulling them into the bushes he anxiously sampled the
contents. In one of the receptacles, river water had very sadly marred
the flavor of the original contents, but in the other, by great good
luck, there was very little adulteration. Harry smacked his lips and,
carefully hiding the keg in the brush, hastily withdrew. Late in the
evening he secured his prize and succeeded in taking it unobserved to
the home of his father, with whom he lived, hiding it in the cellar.

When Harry told his father what he had done, the latter was greatly
pleased, but cautioned him that he must not let a certain younger
brother know anything about it, as he might indulge too freely.

From that time on, day after day, the father and son, coming in from
their tasks, would adroitly make their way to the carefully concealed
prize in the cellar, from which they would emerge with that deep
satisfaction associated with luxuries which can be enjoyed at someone\xE2\x80\x99s
else expense.

However, the younger brother became interested. It seemed to him that
there was \xE2\x80\x9Csomething doing\xE2\x80\x9D in the house. So, one morning he decided
that he was not able to work and left to himself he made a careful
search of the cellar. Just what he did afterwards may be inferred from
the sequel.

When the father and son sat down to supper, there was a vacant place.
Hugh was absent. Just what he was doing was uncertain, but the mystery
was soon solved. A kindly neighbor came in to say that a cop had found
Hugh parading the streets in such an extremely hilarious condition
that he had found it necessary to place him in seclusion to sober up.

The next morning Harry and his father went to court, paid the fine
and Hugh was allowed to go home. Just what became of the keg and its
contents does not appear in the history, but it is not likely that it
was taken back to the river.

       *       *       *       *       *

While the anguish produced by prohibition is of recent date in most
states, in one or two New England states it befell to an earlier
generation to endure this form of privation a good many years ago.


The Prohibition Whale Oil

In this region prohibition made its entrance about the time that whale
oil was in its last stages of usefulness for illuminating purposes.

It had been a long established custom to include among other
necessities at the grocery store, the refilling of the family jug
with Medford rum. And when, owing to meddlesome tactics of certain
teetotalers, storekeepers became somewhat shy about replenishing these
jugs, there was much dismay.

However, there were exceptional dealers who not only had a stock of old
Medford on hand, but felt a deep sympathy for old reliable customers
who were thus subjected to such inconvenience, and who would \xE2\x80\x9Cfind
a way.\xE2\x80\x9D One of these ways was to have the customer call for oil and
at the same time give a certain signal. When this plan was working
well, the customer would find the contents of the jug to be entirely
satisfactory.

One Saturday afternoon, two worthy citizens who lived on adjacent
farms back on the hills, started to go to the country store to do a
little \xE2\x80\x9Ctrading\xE2\x80\x9D for their wives. Incidentally one of them took along
the faithful old jug which had been refilled several times in a very
satisfactory way since the prohibition edict was supposed to be in full
working order.

Entering the store, the man with the jug approached the counter and
gave his order for a few small articles needed by the housekeeper at
home. As there were people standing about and the clerk was a new
recruit, the customer asked that the clerk fill the jug with \xE2\x80\x9Coil,\xE2\x80\x9D
at the same time giving him the usual signal, a broad wink. After a
brief chat with acquaintances regarding crops, the weather, etc., the
customer gathered up his parcels and his jug and accompanied by his
neighbor, who had also made some moderate purchases, went outside,
placed the parcels in the buggy and started for home.

It is quite likely that they would not have started for home nearly so
soon but for anticipations associated with the jug. A half mile or so
out of the village there was a bend in the road, an old-time covered
bridge being the only building in sight. The team was brought to a
halt and while the horse started to browse by the roadside, the jug
was brought out by the owner, uncorked and passed over to his friend,
who, relieving himself of a \xE2\x80\x9Cchew,\xE2\x80\x9D lifted the jug to his lips and
took a large mouthful of the contents. Controlling himself by violent
effort, he passed the jug back to the owner who was waiting with as
much patience as he could muster, leaned over the side of the buggy
and succeeded in relieving his mouth of its unwelcome contents. The
owner of the jug, however, was not so fortunate, as in his eagerness he
swallowed a good-sized mouthful of the whale oil before he discovered
his horrible mistake.

Tradition has it that these two worthies were never quite so friendly
after that unfortunate incident. What happened to the store clerk is
unknown.

Kerosene oil would doubtless prove to be a very enticing beverage
compared with whale oil, perhaps as nauseous as any oleaginous
substance yet discovered.

       *       *       *       *       *

When in prohibition times some pleading citizen who has been the
recipient of illegitimate favors becomes too much elated and
\xE2\x80\x9Cdiscloses\xE2\x80\x9D on his benefactor (?), he is regarded by the faithful as
having reached the subterranean depths of infamy.


The Righteous Wrath of \xE2\x80\x9CMarm\xE2\x80\x9D Hooker

Such was the opinion at least of a certain robust woman who kept
a hotel and who was widely known as Marm Hooker. Yielding to the
persuasions and implorings of a certain ne\xE2\x80\x99er-do-well, she supplied him
with a flask of stimulant which he needed for his \xE2\x80\x9Crun down system.\xE2\x80\x9D
The result was that the object of her benevolence became hilarious
and later on, under the severe cross-examination of the prohibition
officer, \xE2\x80\x9Cdisclosed\xE2\x80\x9D on his benefactress. In her opinion, human
depravity could reach no lower depths.

Besides providing accommodations for man and beast in the function of
tavern keeper, Marm Hooker would arrange once a month or so during
the winter for a public dance in the old-fashioned hall at her hotel.
Patrons who attended these dances were not exclusive in their social
ideas.

In a remote corner of the second floor of the tavern, there was a small
room and when the dance was well under way, Marm Hooker would withdraw
to this little sanctum of hers, while those whom she regarded as
trustworthy would one by one secure admission for two or three minutes.

One night who should appear at this dance, which was public, but the
ignominious person who had at one time \xE2\x80\x9Cdisclosed.\xE2\x80\x9D When Marm Hooker
learned that he was present, she frowned, but when she opened the door
of her sanctum, after repeated knocks and found that this same person
had the unparalleled impudence to again ask for liquid refreshments,
her indignation found expression, with such effect that the applicant
slunk away in confusion.

An hour passed. At a certain signal the door would be opened and a
customer admitted. Business had been brisk and the robust proprietress
had forgotten for a moment the impudent assurance of the man whom she
had chased away. There came another signal in exactly the prescribed
form and this genial lady, opening the door two or three inches, had it
pushed wider open and who should come inside but the obnoxious visitor
aforesaid. As he came in, he slammed the door shut, locked it and put
the key in his pocket. He then informed Marm Hooker that he should not
leave unless she supplied him with a flask of whiskey.

It would appear that the robust lady was cornered, but subsequent
events proved otherwise. Pausing for a moment in amazement at the
boldness of the intruder, she rushed forward and seizing the man with
an iron grip, hurled him against the door with such force that it was
completely shattered, the victim falling in a heap outside.

Righteous indignation can accomplish wonders.

       *       *       *       *       *

Those who reside in the great cities become somewhat callous to those
frequent tragedies to which poor humanity is still subject. But there
was considerable excitement in a little country town one morning
when an elderly resident was found dead in a clump of bushes by the
roadside.


\xE2\x80\x9CPoor Kelly Took the Rest\xE2\x80\x9D

The victim, named Kelly, was an amiable, harmless individual who was
well along in years and led a rather inactive life. While there were no
marks indicating violence, the circumstances were somewhat suspicious.

An inquest seemed in order and the proper officials gathered at a
suitable location to investigate, so far as possible, the circumstances
associated with the case. Inquiries, however, seemed to produce no
results, until at last someone recalled seeing Mr. Kelly the day before
in the company of Uncle Jimmy Daley, a kind and generally respected old
man who lived on a little farm some miles away.

A sheriff\xE2\x80\x99s officer was therefore hurriedly dispatched with a lively
horse to bring Uncle Jimmy to the inquest. In a relatively short time
Uncle Jimmy appeared, apparently very much cast down at the sad news
regarding Mr. Kelly.

Various other witnesses, who later recalled having seen the deceased on
the previous day, gave their testimony one after another, Uncle Jimmy
sitting disconsolately in the background. Finally he was called forward
and asked to tell what he knew of the departed.

There was of course an opportunity for the witness to go into
considerable detail, but he did not apparently consider it necessary.
And after he had made his simple statement, there seemed to be no
occasion to procrastinate the proceedings any further.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Uncle Jimmy, \xE2\x80\x9CI found Mr. Kelly yisterday here in tow-un
and as he lives along the road toward my place, I invited him to ride
with me. After we had gone up the road a piece, Mr. Kelly took a good
sized bottle of whiskey out of his pocket and offered me a drink.
Indeed he offered me several drinks on the way.\xE2\x80\x9D

The court thus assembled listened with breathless attention to this
simple statement of the witness, but were even more impressed with his
final words:

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Uncle Jimmy in a sad refrain, \xE2\x80\x9CI took what was good for me,
and Kelly, poor mon, took the rest. And now he\xE2\x80\x99s no more the day.\xE2\x80\x9D

Uncle Jimmy was excused. The court hastily agreed upon a verdict and
the inquest was over.




CHAPTER XIV

TALES OF THE FARM HIRED MAN


Any record of New England rural life would be incomplete that left out
the farm hired man.

The farm employer who does not make a careful study of how to get the
best service he can from his help, and at the same time retain that
good will and cheerful co-operation which are so essential to pleasant
personal relations, is not likely to succeed to any satisfactory degree.


The Hand Mowers at Murray\xE2\x80\x99s

Mr. Murray conducted a large and somewhat rocky farm in the days before
farm machinery had been developed to anything like its present state
of efficiency. He had a large field of grass that he was in a hurry to
cut and put in the barn. The field was pretty nearly rectangular and
one July day Mr. Murray devised a very ingenious plan. There were four
hired men to undertake the job of mowing the field with hand scythes.
Three of these men were assigned brief tasks, the fourth taking his
place to turn the grindstone while the proprietor ground the scythe.
This man was then told to mow around the field.

Another man was called up to perform the same duty at the grindstone,
after which he was sent after number one. The third and fourth each
took their turn and was started after the others.

It took just about the same time at the grindstone as to mow across
one side of the rectangular field. Consequently number one was just
starting on the last lap when number four struck in behind the others.

The owner\xE2\x80\x99s scheme was now plain to the four mowers. He was expecting
each man would exert himself to overtake the next one. But instead of
being resentful, the humor of the situation appealed to them. They
entered into the spirit of the occasion with enthusiasm and before
twelve noon they had completed their tasks and made a record.

Naturally the owner of the farm was much pleased with the result of
his carefully laid out plan. But it is not to be supposed that other
occasions did not furnish opportunity for the hired men to get even.
The farm holder who tries crafty methods to secure abnormal production
by his employees must expect to see the score balanced sooner or later.

       *       *       *       *       *

That \xE2\x80\x9CHope springs eternal in the human breast,\xE2\x80\x9D is shown by endless
demonstrations. A conspicuous example of that hope appeared in the
unique experience of the country editor.


The Sporting Venture of the Country Editor

In a certain green valley of a New England state, there was a race
course.... There were many gamey horses in that valley and the speeding
fever ran high. Several successive trotting events associated with
agricultural fairs, had drawn the attention of horse lovers to the
excellent track. And so it came about that the editor of a little
country weekly, who lived some distance away, conceived a brilliant
plan. Tired of the meager rewards of news gathering, he decided to
organize a trotting tournament on this popular track and make a grand
coup.

Therefore he made his announcements of several races for which he
solicited entries by well-known horsemen. The response in this respect
was disappointing, but he felt sure the revenues from gate admissions
would make the venture successful.

The eventful day was fair and the editor was quite elated to see a
considerable crowd gathering to watch the races. This state of mind,
however, received a rude shock when he sauntered out to the entrance to
get an estimate on the receipts. He found to his dismay that a large
proportion of the admissions had been on the strength of an annual pass.

Hastening to the secretary of the Association, he was blandly informed
that the grading of the track had been done on a co-operative plan by
which all the farmers of the valley who contributed a certain amount
of labor were entitled to admission at all times, except during the
week when the annual fair was being held.

This was a staggering blow. He was under obligations to pay the
trotting purses and the prospects were that he would be several hundred
dollars out of pocket. Accordingly he hastened to the owners of the
trotting horses and proposed that they accept a pro rata percentage
of the premiums as substitutes for the full amounts. He was coolly
informed that they didn\xE2\x80\x99t do business that way. Considering themselves
victimized, the owners began to take their horses off the grounds.

It was about at this point that real trouble began to loom up. Of those
visitors who had actually paid good money for admission, there was
a large element of farm hired men. They began to clamor for action.
They wanted what they had paid for. Getting no satisfaction from the
race horse people, they demanded an audience with the editor. He was
invisible. Finally someone reported that he had been seen entering the
woods in the rear of the grounds.

Just as the vociferous youths had about decided to organize a hunt and
capture the fugitive dead or alive, a carriage came dashing through
the gateway and a well-known citizen pulled up his horse before the
crowd, and demanded the attention of all. He said the gentleman by his
side was the man they were looking for and that, although he had been
alarmed by their threatening manner and had hastened away, he had come
back to face the music.

The editor now arose and announced that he had arranged for the race
events to be carried out. The volatile spirits of the boys were quickly
evident. The races were called. The horses performed in a satisfactory
manner and harmony reigned.

But back in seclusion the poor country editor was signing time notes to
make up the losses of the day.

And yet hope springs eternal!

The husky farm hand who works hard during the day might be expected to
retire early. And indeed he often does; but there are occasions when he
does not find it necessary.

It is really astonishing how much day and night work the healthy
outdoor worker of twenty or twenty-five can endure.


\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve Found the Spring\xE2\x80\x9D

It was late summer and very busy times on the farm, but this did not
stand in the way of plans for a certain evening\xE2\x80\x99s festivities. These
plans involved several young men, a robust but tender young rooster and
a supply of fresh, green corn, also for roasting purposes.

The scenes of these activities were on the shore of a little lake. The
fringe of trees stretching along the shore allowed the selection of a
location which was invisible to all but the parties interested.

The banquet was a great success. The corn was delicious and the roast
chicken even more so. There was an abundance of jokes and time passed
rapidly.

A supply of fresh water had been brought from the lake, but it was warm
and tasteless. Finally one of the boys suggested that he thought there
was a cold spring near by, if they could only locate it.

Away from the cheerful blaze of the bonfire, the shores of the lake
were dark as Egypt. But finally one of the boys said he believed he
could find that spring. Taking a small, tin pail, which they had
thoughtfully brought with them, he started out.

Nothing could be seen of the young man, but his flounderings about
among the dense underbrush were plainly audible. Time passed and he
seemed to have had considerable difficulty in locating the spring.
Conversation died away, as all were watching and listening. Suddenly
there came a noise of a succession of ramblings about in the bushes,
followed by a loud splash as of someone falling heavily in the lake.
The young men by the bonfire leaped to their feet. They were alarmed
but speedily reassured.

There was a gurgling noise for a moment, next the sound of someone
swimming in the lake and later pulling himself up by the bushes,
and then the well-known voice of the missing man came back with the
cheering words:

\xE2\x80\x9CBoys, I have found the spring!\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

As before stated, it is the tactful farm owner who secures the most
satisfactory production in the way of farm labor. The professional
farm hand with years of experience behind him, is quite prone to be
resentful of criticism.


The Expert Who Repaired the Fences

One of these old-time laborers was employed by a man who owned several
adjacent farms and there was always a superabundance of work on hand.

This farmer had a large mountain pasture for his young cattle and it
was rather essential that the fences be secure, as otherwise the cattle
might break through, wander away and be hopelessly astray before they
were missed.

One spring an old veteran farm hand was intrusted with the task of
repairing these fences. After several days, he reported that everything
was all right and was assigned to other work. A day or two later, a man
residing on the other side of the mountain, reported that the young
cattle had broken out and were in his enclosure.

The \xE2\x80\x9Cboys,\xE2\x80\x9D including the veteran aforesaid, were sent after the
strayers and devoted the entire afternoon in getting them back into
their proper domain. The next morning the same veteran fence fixer set
out again with instructions to make a thorough job of the repairs this
time, so that there would be no further trouble. He spent another day
on the fences and came back at night with positive assurances to the
owner that the young cattle could not possibly go astray again.

Two or three days later, the same neighbor came from the same distant
farm, informing them that the cattle had once more broken through the
fences and again a rescue party was sent after the wanderers.

That evening at the supper table those present seemed disposed to
consider the entire matter a pretty good joke on the fence builder,
who expressed his unqualified amazement as to how the fence could have
given away after all he had done to put it in repair.

The owner of the farm who had listened to the various jocose comments
in silence, finally volunteered an explanation:

\xE2\x80\x9CProbably a chipmunk ran along the fence somewhere and broke it down.\xE2\x80\x9D

When next the fence builder reported a satisfactory job, his guarantee
was found to be reliable.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sometimes the farm hand becomes a fixture in the family and is regarded
with real affection by those whom he has seen grow up from childhood.


The Man Who \xE2\x80\x9CArrived In a Great Hurry\xE2\x80\x9D

In a certain bustling New England city, there was a young married woman
who retained a very considerable regard for the \xE2\x80\x9Chired man\xE2\x80\x9D who had
lived in her family from her earliest recollections, even until the
present. It was her great desire to have \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Harvey\xE2\x80\x9D come down to
her city home and let her show him around. As he had scarcely ever left
the town in which he was born and had passed his lifetime, this lady
could see great possibilities of entertainment for herself as well as
for Uncle Harvey. Making her annual summer visit at the old homestead,
she repeated her invitation with such earnestness that Uncle Harvey was
finally, but with evident reluctance, induced to promise to visit her
without fail that fall.

Every time she wrote home she sent reminders that she had the old man\xE2\x80\x99s
positive promise and that he must not fail her. Finally he decided he
had to go.

Uncle Harvey had had very little experience in railroad travel and it
was quite a good many miles from the farm to the city home where he
was to be entertained. After considerable discussion as to whether he
should take a very early train that stopped at all stations, or go on a
later express train, he was finally induced to take his chances on the
fast train, although if left to his own choice he would have preferred
the slower train as probably being more safe to travel on.

With a new traveling bag, especially purchased for the occasion,
carefully packed for him, Uncle Harvey, in a stunning new suit
complete, was carried to the railroad station, assisted to buy his
ticket and escorted onto the train. His excitement was manifest,
although with pretended calmness he tried to keep it hidden. His escort
shook the old man\xE2\x80\x99s hand warmly and reminded him that he had promised
to write a postal card as soon as he reached his destination.

The train moved out of the station and Uncle Harvey was lost to sight,
but true to his promise he sent the postal card which arrived at the
farm the very next day. It was as follows:

    \xE2\x80\x9CDear Folks:

    I am here safe and sound. Ethel met me at the station. I am
    having a fine time.

    P. S. I arrived in a great hurry about three o\xE2\x80\x99clock.

  Uncle Harvey.\xE2\x80\x9D

It is one of the delightful tributes to our present civilization that
it is perfectly possible for an intelligent woman to live an entire
lifetime and still be so shielded from the sordid things in life as to
be hardly aware of their existence.


\xE2\x80\x9CWhere\xE2\x80\x99s Hadlock?\xE2\x80\x9D

In the cheery kitchen of an old but beautiful New England farmhouse, an
elderly woman was busily engaged in preparing the evening meal. She was
a woman of education and broad sympathies, prominent in the church and
in all good works. Her kindly solicitude for the household took into
account even the most transient laborer temporarily employed on the
farm.

One of the hands who had lived at the farm for several years was taking
a short vacation. It had vaguely come to the ears of the kind lady that
this man had been known to indulge a little too freely in stimulants.
It seemed to her, however, that there must be some mistake about these
rumors, in view of the never-failing good behavior, respectful manner
and general capability of the man in his relations with the family and
the farm.

Sad to say on this occasion above mentioned, there was disillusionment
in store for this friendly lady.

The kitchen door opened and the man who had been on vacation entered.
The cheery welcome with which she was about to greet him was checked on
her lips. Somehow he looked strange----different.

Standing in the entrance to the room and swaying slightly on his feet,
the man, whose hat was tilted a little to one side, inquired in tones
of solemn gravity:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere\xE2\x80\x99s Hadlock?\xE2\x80\x9D

The woman looked at him in utter bewilderment. He smiled a silly smile
and again asked the question:

\xE2\x80\x9CShay, where\xE2\x80\x99s Hadlock?\xE2\x80\x9D

And now it dawned upon this estimable old lady that those stories which
had come to her in the past must have had some foundation. For the man
who was asking this question was Hadlock himself.

       *       *       *       *       *

Many tales have been told of the French-Canadian \xE2\x80\x9Chabitant\xE2\x80\x9D which would
imply that he is a very conservative person. It would appear, however,
that when he becomes transplanted on a farm in \xE2\x80\x9Cthe States,\xE2\x80\x9D he is
quite capable of getting up to date.


A French-Canadian Version of Employers\xE2\x80\x99 Liability Insurance

A wide awake \xE2\x80\x9CCanuck\xE2\x80\x9D who was branching out as a progressive farmer in
a New England state, became much interested in a proposed employers\xE2\x80\x99
liability bill which was up for discussion in the legislature. Some
of his friends, being a little skeptical, he proceeded to make the
matter clear to them----how successfully the reader may judge from the
following:

\xE2\x80\x9CAll dose farmer mans be protect so when hees ole mare kick himself up,
broke it the harness, kill de wagon and de hire mans; or if the mow
machine run away from de span hoss and kill the whole beesness, hire
man, machine and horse,----What for that farmer mans hees be blame in
dis bill? No, sir; I guess not!\xE2\x80\x9D

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

By Jane Austen



Chapter 1


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Mr. Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D said his lady to him one day, \xE2\x80\x9Chave you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it is,\xE2\x80\x9D returned she; \xE2\x80\x9Cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you not want to know who has taken it?\xE2\x80\x9D cried his wife impatiently.

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was invitation enough.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is his name?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBingley.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he married or single?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow so? How can it affect them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Mr. Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D replied his wife, \xE2\x80\x9Chow can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that his design in settling here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDesign! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
party.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to
go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to
visit him if you do not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey have none of them much to recommend them,\xE2\x80\x9D replied he; \xE2\x80\x9Cthey are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You
take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh, you do not know what I suffer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.



Chapter 2


Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with:

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\xE2\x80\x9D said her mother
resentfully, \xE2\x80\x9Csince we are not to visit.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you forget, mamma,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo more have I,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\xE2\x80\x99s sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CKitty has no discretion in her coughs,\xE2\x80\x9D said her father; \xE2\x80\x9Cshe times
them ill.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not cough for my own amusement,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Kitty fretfully. \xE2\x80\x9CWhen is
your next ball to be, Lizzy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo-morrow fortnight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAye, so it is,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cand Mrs. Long does not come back
till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI honour your circumspection. A fortnight\xE2\x80\x99s acquaintance is certainly
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \xE2\x80\x9CNonsense,
nonsense!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\xE2\x80\x9D cried he. \xE2\x80\x9CDo
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books and make extracts.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,\xE2\x80\x9D he continued, \xE2\x80\x9Clet us return to Mr.
Bingley.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sick of Mr. Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D cried his wife.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If
I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called
on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now.\xE2\x80\x9D

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat an excellent father you have, girls!\xE2\x80\x9D said she, when the door was
shut. \xE2\x80\x9CI do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said Lydia stoutly, \xE2\x80\x9CI am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I\xE2\x80\x99m the tallest.\xE2\x80\x9D

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.



Chapter 3


Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s heart were entertained.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \xE2\x80\x9Cand all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\xE2\x80\x9D

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s visit, and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.

An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already
had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get
a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only
six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.

Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he
was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all
his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.

Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
to join it.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI would not be so fastidious as you are,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D and turning round he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
\xE2\x80\x9CShe is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.

The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\xE2\x80\x99s
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife\xE2\x80\x99s views on
the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a
different story to hear.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D as she entered the room, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her
twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,
and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf he had had any compassion for _me_,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her husband impatiently,
\xE2\x80\x9Che would not have danced half so much! For God\xE2\x80\x99s sake, say no more of
his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
Hurst\xE2\x80\x99s gown--\xE2\x80\x9D

Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I can assure you,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 4


When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
much she admired him.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is just what a young man ought to be,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Csensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much
ease, with such perfect good breeding!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is also handsome,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhich a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
did not expect such a compliment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
stupider person.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Lizzy!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
life.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
what I think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it
everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the
good of everybody\xE2\x80\x99s character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man\xE2\x80\x99s sisters,
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she
was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brother\xE2\x80\x99s fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade.

Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.

His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately.

Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s regard, Bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offense.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
but she smiled too much.

Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one
whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.



Chapter 5


Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;
and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,
unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
James\xE2\x80\x99s had made him courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s intimate friend.

That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas. \xE2\x80\x9C_You_ were Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s first choice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; but he seemed to like his second better.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr. Robinson.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson\xE2\x80\x99s asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question: \xE2\x80\x98Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Charlotte. \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI beg you would not put it into Lizzy\xE2\x80\x99s head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you quite sure, ma\xE2\x80\x99am?--is not there a little mistake?\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane.
\xE2\x80\x9CI certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at
being spoke to.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bingley told me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he never speaks much,
unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Lucas, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I
wish he had danced with Eliza.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnother time, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said her mother, \xE2\x80\x9CI would not dance with _him_,
if I were you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHis pride,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Lucas, \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is very true,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPride,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, \xE2\x80\x9Cis a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D cried a young Lucas, who came with
his sisters, \xE2\x80\x9CI should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs.
Bennet; \xE2\x80\x9Cand if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
directly.\xE2\x80\x9D

The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.



Chapter 6


The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards
the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother\xE2\x80\x99s admiration. It
was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and
to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt may perhaps be pleasant,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9Cto be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
discover it too.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRemember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\xE2\x80\x99s disposition as you do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his
attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for
falling in love as much as she chooses.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour plan is a good one,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhere nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
these are not Jane\xE2\x80\x99s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9CI wish Jane success with all my heart; and
if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.

He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas\xE2\x80\x99s, where a large party were
assembled.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat does Mr. Darcy mean,\xE2\x80\x9D said she to Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9Cby listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are severe on us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Lucas. \xE2\x80\x9CI am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers.\xE2\x80\x9D On Miss Lucas\xE2\x80\x99s persevering, however,
she added, \xE2\x80\x9CVery well, if it must be so, it must.\xE2\x80\x9D And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9CThere is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of
course familiar with: \xE2\x80\x98Keep your breath to cool your porridge\xE2\x80\x99; and I
shall keep mine to swell my song.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.

Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.

Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sir William only smiled. \xE2\x80\x9CYour friend performs delightfully,\xE2\x80\x9D he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
you often dance at St. James\xE2\x80\x99s?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have a house in town, I conclude?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy bowed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond
of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas.\xE2\x80\x9D

He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed
to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.\xE2\x80\x9D
 And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half-hour.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy is all politeness,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, smiling.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,
we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a
partner?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:

\xE2\x80\x9CI can guess the subject of your reverie.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should imagine not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the
nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Elizabeth Bennet.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Elizabeth Bennet!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Miss Bingley. \xE2\x80\x9CI am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you
joy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady\xE2\x80\x99s
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.



Chapter 7


Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\xE2\x80\x99s
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.

She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.

The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner\xE2\x80\x99s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters\xE2\x80\x99, and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
headquarters.

Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers\xE2\x80\x99 names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of
felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign.

After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed:

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced.\xE2\x80\x9D

Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am astonished, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
of anybody\xE2\x80\x99s children, it should not be of my own, however.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when
I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William\xE2\x80\x99s in
his regimentals.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMamma,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Lydia, \xE2\x80\x9Cmy aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\xE2\x80\x99s as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke\xE2\x80\x99s library.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is from Miss Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, and then read it aloud.

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR FRIEND,--

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
for a whole day\xE2\x80\x99s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a
quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,

\xE2\x80\x9CCAROLINE BINGLEY\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith the officers!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Lydia. \xE2\x80\x9CI wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDining out,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat is very unlucky.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCan I have the carriage?\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat would be a good scheme,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s chaise to go to Meryton,
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI had much rather go in the coach.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if you have got them to-day,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cmy mother\xE2\x80\x99s purpose
will be answered.\xE2\x80\x9D

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAREST LIZZY,--

\xE2\x80\x9CI find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the
matter with me.--Yours, etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, \xE2\x80\x9Cif your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking
was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow can you be so silly,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cas to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs this a hint to me, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said her father, \xE2\x80\x9Cto send for the
horses?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI admire the activity of your benevolence,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Mary, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe will go as far as Meryton with you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf we make haste,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lydia, as they walked along, \xE2\x80\x9Cperhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\xE2\x80\x9D

In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers\xE2\x80\x99 wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.

She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother\xE2\x80\x99s manners there was something better than politeness; there
was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as
to the occasion\xE2\x80\x99s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.

Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her.

When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in
fact, nothing to do elsewhere.

When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
of clothes.



Chapter 8


At five o\xE2\x80\x99clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s, she could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.

Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
same, and added:

\xE2\x80\x9CShe has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
looked almost wild.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour picture may be very exact, Louisa,\xE2\x80\x9D said Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut this was
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such
an exhibition.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Bingley.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied; \xE2\x80\x9Cthey were brightened by the exercise.\xE2\x80\x9D A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:

\xE2\x80\x9CI have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
no chance of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is capital,\xE2\x80\x9D added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cit
would not make them one jot less agreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy.

To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend\xE2\x80\x99s vulgar relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you prefer reading to cards?\xE2\x80\x9D said he; \xE2\x80\x9Cthat is rather singular.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Eliza Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cdespises cards. She is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9CI am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Cand
I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
others--all that his library afforded.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am astonished,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat my father should have left
so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt ought to be good,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cit has been the work of many
generations.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNeglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish it may.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am talking of possibilities, Charles.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very
little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew
near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his
eldest sister, to observe the game.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Cwill
she be as tall as I am?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s height, or
rather taller.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished
for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is amazing to me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Chow young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure
I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour list of the common extent of accomplishments,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Chas
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNor I, I am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! certainly,\xE2\x80\x9D cried his faithful assistant, \xE2\x80\x9Cno one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides
all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half-deserved.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll this she must possess,\xE2\x80\x9D added Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Cand to all this she must
yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe united.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.

\xE2\x80\x9CElizabeth Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
\xE2\x80\x9Cis one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUndoubtedly,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthere is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother\xE2\x80\x99s proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief
to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.



Chapter 9


Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\xE2\x80\x99s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
would not listen, therefore, to her daughter\xE2\x80\x99s proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed I have, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D was her answer. \xE2\x80\x9CShe is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRemoved!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Bingley. \xE2\x80\x9CIt must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may depend upon it, Madam,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthat Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she
remains with us.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cif it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are
nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the
country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it
in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhatever I do is done in a hurry,\xE2\x80\x9D replied he; \xE2\x80\x9Cand therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou begin to comprehend me, do you?\xE2\x80\x9D cried he, turning towards her.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cremember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI did not know before,\xE2\x80\x9D continued Bingley immediately, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you were a
studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
least that advantage.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe country,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Ccan in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood. \xE2\x80\x9CI assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town.\xE2\x80\x9D

Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I am in the country,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9CI never wish to leave it;
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman,\xE2\x80\x9D looking at Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Cseemed to think the country was nothing
at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. \xE2\x80\x9CYou quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
which you must acknowledge to be true.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So
genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid Charlotte dine with you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;
_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,
I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe seems a very pleasant young woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane\xE2\x80\x99s beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he
did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses
on her, and very pretty they were.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd so ended his affection,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth impatiently. \xE2\x80\x9CThere has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy.

\xE2\x80\x9COf a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attention of the officers, to whom her uncle\xE2\x80\x99s good dinners, and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very
equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother\xE2\x80\x99s ear:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lydia declared herself satisfied. \xE2\x80\x9COh! yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\xE2\x80\x9D she
added, \xE2\x80\x9CI shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\xE2\x80\x99 behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s witticisms on _fine eyes_.



Chapter 10


The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in union with her opinion of each.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\xE2\x80\x9D

He made no answer.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou write uncommonly fast.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPray tell your sister that I long to see her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have already told her so once, by your desire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you--but I always mend my own.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow can you contrive to write so even?\xE2\x80\x9D

He was silent.

\xE2\x80\x9CTell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
present I have not room to do them justice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease, cannot write ill.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her
brother, \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for
words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy style of writing is very different from yours.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9CCharles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour humility, Mr. Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cmust disarm reproof.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing is more deceitful,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Cthan the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNay,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,
I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, \xE2\x80\x98Bingley, you had better
stay till next week,\xE2\x80\x99 you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and at another word, might stay a month.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have only proved by this,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
more than he did himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am exceedingly gratified,\xE2\x80\x9D said Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cby your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWould Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBy all means,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Clet us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.

\xE2\x80\x9CI see your design, Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said his friend. \xE2\x80\x9CYou dislike an argument,
and want to silence this.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat you ask,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cis no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.

Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s eyes were fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her
because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,
however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.

After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by
a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her:

\xE2\x80\x9CDo not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?\xE2\x80\x9D

She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say \xE2\x80\x98Yes,\xE2\x80\x99
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed I do not dare.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.

Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed
in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. As for your Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s picture, you must not have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.\xE2\x80\x9D

At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.

\xE2\x80\x9CI did not know that you intended to walk,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou used us abominably ill,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Mrs. Hurst, \xE2\x80\x9Crunning away without
telling us that you were coming out.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said:

\xE2\x80\x9CThis walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue.\xE2\x80\x9D

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered:

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear
to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Good-bye.\xE2\x80\x9D

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.



Chapter 11


When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.

But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also
made her a slight bow, and said he was \xE2\x80\x9Cvery glad;\xE2\x80\x9D but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s salutation. He was full of joy and
attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from
the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone
else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.

When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
and rings, joined now and then in her brother\xE2\x80\x99s conversation with Miss
Bennet.

Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \xE2\x80\x9CHow pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library.\xE2\x80\x9D

No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CBy the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are
not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you mean Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her brother, \xE2\x80\x9Che may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send
round my cards.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should like balls infinitely better,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cif they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
the day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMuch more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but
Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In
the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,
turning to Elizabeth, said:

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
meaning?\xE2\x80\x9D--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all,\xE2\x80\x9D was her answer; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. \xE2\x80\x9CYou either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other\xE2\x80\x99s confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be
completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! shocking!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Bingley. \xE2\x80\x9CI never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CWe
can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will
not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CThat is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a
laugh.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Chas given me more credit than can be.
The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their
actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth--\xE2\x80\x9Cthere are such people, but I hope I
am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,
and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely
what you are without.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSuch as vanity and pride.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

\xE2\x80\x9CYour examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley;
\xE2\x80\x9Cand pray what is the result?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
himself without disguise.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9CI have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost
forever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_That_ is a failing indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CImplacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd _your_ defect is to hate everybody.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd yours,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied with a smile, \xE2\x80\x9Cis willfully to misunderstand
them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo let us have a little music,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. \xE2\x80\x9CLouisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst?\xE2\x80\x9D

Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments\xE2\x80\x99 recollection, was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.



Chapter 12


In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane\xE2\x80\x99s week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them
very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.

To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope
of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.

On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of
its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.

They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it
had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.



Chapter 13


\xE2\x80\x9CI hope, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled. \xE2\x80\x9CA gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be
got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this
moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is _not_ Mr. Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said her husband; \xE2\x80\x9Cit is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life.\xE2\x80\x9D

This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:

\xE2\x80\x9CAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago
I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D cried his wife, \xE2\x80\x9CI cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They
had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which
Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cand
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did
before him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Sir,--

\xE2\x80\x9CThe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but
for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--\xE2\x80\x98There, Mrs.
Bennet.\xE2\x80\x99--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having
received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de
Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the
offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for
it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o\xE2\x80\x99clock, and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se\xE2\x80\x99ennight
following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I
remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

\xE2\x80\x9CWILLIAM COLLINS\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt four o\xE2\x80\x99clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. \xE2\x80\x9CHe seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if
he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThough it is difficult,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cto guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe must be an oddity, I think,\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CI cannot make him
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn point of composition,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mary, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed.\xE2\x80\x9D

To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.

Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a
tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted--\xE2\x80\x9D

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s admiration. The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its
cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who
assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a
good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He
begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.



Chapter 14


During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh\xE2\x80\x99s attention to his wishes, and consideration for
his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that \xE2\x80\x9Che had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cand
I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s residence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \xE2\x80\x9Cthen she is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHas she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHer indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the
British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that
her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou judge very properly,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cand it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.

By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,
glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily
assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything
announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and
begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at
him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
deliberation he chose Fordyce\xE2\x80\x99s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the
volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three
pages, she interrupted him with:

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.



Chapter 15


Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which
he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father\xE2\x80\x99s
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.

His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a
quarter of an hour\xE2\x80\x99s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. \xE2\x80\x9CAs to
her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before was now high in her good graces.

Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.

In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were
immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was
the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came
to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the
stranger\xE2\x80\x99s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,
determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under
pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately
had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with
him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a
commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of
beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together
very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy
and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the
ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and
Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to
Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated
it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,
after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.

In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Phillip\xE2\x80\x99s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s
pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of
Mrs. Phillips\xE2\x80\x99s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
invitation.

Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,
from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was
eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as
their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing
about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones\xE2\x80\x99s shop-boy in the
street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility
was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\xE2\x80\x99s introduction of him. She
received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with
as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous
acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,
however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,
however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that
Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a
lieutenant\xE2\x80\x99s commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the
last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.
Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the
occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become \xE2\x80\x9Cstupid,
disagreeable fellows.\xE2\x80\x9D Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses
the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either
or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain
such behaviour than her sister.

Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring
Mrs. Phillips\xE2\x80\x99s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.



Chapter 16


As no objection was made to the young people\xE2\x80\x99s engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and
the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\xE2\x80\x99s invitation, and was then in
the house.

When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper\xE2\x80\x99s room.

In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and
the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel
that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
interesting by the skill of the speaker.

With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he
had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know little of the game at present,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation in life--\xE2\x80\x9D Mrs. Phillips was very
glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.

Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear
him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not
even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.

\xE2\x80\x9CAbout a month,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, \xE2\x80\x9CHe is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Wickham; \xE2\x80\x9Chis estate there is a noble one. A clear
ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for
I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
infancy.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs much as I ever wish to be,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth very warmly. \xE2\x80\x9CI have
spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have no right to give _my_ opinion,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wickham, \xE2\x80\x9Cas to his being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_
to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in
the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot pretend to be sorry,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wickham, after a short
interruption, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.\xE2\x80\x9D Wickham only shook his head.

\xE2\x80\x9CI wonder,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense
of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he
is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never
be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by
a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.

Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that
he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
intelligible gallantry.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\xE2\x80\x9D he added,
\xE2\x80\x9Cwhich was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be
a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood heavens!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut how could _that_ be? How could his
will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain
it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was
of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and
I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can
recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort
of men, and that he hates me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSome time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut what,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, after a pause, \xE2\x80\x9Ccan have been his motive? What can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\xE2\x80\x99s uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
of preference which was often given me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this.\xE2\x80\x9D

After a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99 reflection, however, she continued, \xE2\x80\x9CI _do_
remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition
must be dreadful.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will not trust myself on the subject,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Wickham; \xE2\x80\x9CI can hardly
be just to him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \xE2\x80\x9CTo
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!\xE2\x80\x9D She could have added, \xE2\x80\x9CA young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable\xE2\x80\x9D--but she contented herself
with, \xE2\x80\x9Cand one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,
connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of
use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father\xE2\x80\x99s active superintendence,
and when, immediately before my father\xE2\x80\x99s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow strange!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CHow abominable! I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for
dishonesty I must call it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt _is_ wonderful,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Wickham, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor almost all his actions may
be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has
connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCan such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what
his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,
to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

He shook his head. \xE2\x80\x9CI wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very
proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is
nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father\xE2\x80\x99s death, her
home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
education.\xE2\x80\x9D

After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you
know Mr. Bingley?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CProbably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is
a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His
pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something
for fortune and figure.\xE2\x80\x9D

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every
point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,
he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged
that she would not make herself uneasy.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know very well, madam,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat when persons sit down to a
card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.

\xE2\x80\x9CLady Catherine de Bourgh,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, \xE2\x80\x9Chas very lately given him
a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\xE2\x80\x9D

This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined for another.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Collins,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe her to be both in a great degree,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Wickham; \xE2\x80\x9CI have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her
nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
understanding of the first class.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper
put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise
of Mrs. Phillips\xE2\x80\x99s supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name
as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.



Chapter 17


Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey have both,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cbeen deceived, I dare say, in some way
or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLaugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\xE2\x80\x99s favourite in such
a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s being imposed on, than
that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it
be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his
looks.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to
think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\xE2\x80\x9D

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,
if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair
became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed
for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their
dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly
asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To
the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet
as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to
the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if
eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s civilities.

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s look
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they
each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhile I can have my mornings to myself,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is enough--I
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s invitation, and if
he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening\xE2\x80\x99s
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat a ball
of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,
a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help
for it, however. Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s happiness and her own were perforce
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy
of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton
once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very
shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.



Chapter 18


Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty
of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose
the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
pleasure in the Bingleys\xE2\x80\x99 invitation to the officers; and though
this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who
told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,
\xE2\x80\x9CI do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\xE2\x80\x9D

This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
him was ecstasy.

She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,
without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her:

\xE2\x80\x9CI dare say you will find him very agreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHeaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
evil.\xE2\x80\x9D

When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours\xE2\x80\x99 looks, their equal amazement in beholding
it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again
silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time
with:--\xE2\x80\x9CIt is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room, or the number of couples.\xE2\x80\x9D

He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.

\xE2\x80\x9CVery well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But
_now_ we may be silent.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBoth,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth archly; \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said he. \xE2\x80\x9CHow near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI must not decide on my own performance.\xE2\x80\x9D

He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, \xE2\x80\x9CWhen you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance.\xE2\x80\x9D

The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said, \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of
_retaining_ them, is less certain.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, \xE2\x80\x9Cand in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at
her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then
flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\xE2\x80\x9D

The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William\xE2\x80\x99s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CSir William\xE2\x80\x99s interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we
are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat think you of books?\xE2\x80\x9D said he, smiling.

\xE2\x80\x9CBooks--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\xE2\x80\x9D said he,
with a look of doubt.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, always,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, \xE2\x80\x9CI remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, with a firm voice.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I ask to what these questions tend?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMerely to the illustration of _your_ character,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. \xE2\x80\x9CI am trying to make it out.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what is your success?\xE2\x80\x9D

She shook her head. \xE2\x80\x9CI do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can readily believe,\xE2\x80\x9D answered he gravely, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\xE2\x80\x9D he coldly replied.
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,
for in Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards
her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.

They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:

\xE2\x80\x9CSo, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!
Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among
his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late
Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to
give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has
always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated
Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but
I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he
cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother
thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent
thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,
Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\xE2\x80\x99s guilt; but really,
considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHis guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Elizabeth angrily; \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
\xE2\x80\x9CExcuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CInsolent girl!\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth to herself. \xE2\x80\x9CYou are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy.\xE2\x80\x9D She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way
before the hope of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s being in the fairest way for happiness.

\xE2\x80\x9CI want to know,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister\xE2\x80\x99s, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane, \xE2\x80\x9CI have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of
his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\xE2\x80\x99s,
Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has
been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s regard.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s sincerity,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth warmly;
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of
both gentlemen as I did before.\xE2\x80\x9D

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have found out,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cby a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady
Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to
do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
I believe him to be Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s _nephew_. It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\xE2\x80\x99nnight.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she
ceased speaking, replied thus:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,
and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that
I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.
Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the
words \xE2\x80\x9Capology,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CHunsford,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CLady Catherine de Bourgh.\xE2\x80\x9D It vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time
to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,
was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have no reason, I assure you,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cto be dissatisfied with my
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\xE2\x80\x9D

As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s two sisters. Her mother\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon
be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but
three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane\xE2\x80\x99s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\xE2\x80\x99s
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor heaven\xE2\x80\x99s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing!\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and
she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,
but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks
of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
Mary\xE2\x80\x99s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was
weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at
Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to
Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs
of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \xE2\x80\x9CThat will do
extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father\xE2\x80\x99s speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Collins, \xE2\x80\x9Cwere so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit
him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family.\xE2\x80\x9D And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many
smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his
wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,
and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably
clever, good kind of young man.

To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though
he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s conversation to herself.

She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s further notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by
a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \xE2\x80\x9CLord,
how tired I am!\xE2\x80\x9D accompanied by a violent yawn.

When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next
day for a short time.

Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.



Chapter 19


The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On
finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,
soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?\xE2\x80\x9D

Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet answered instantly, \xE2\x80\x9COh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy
will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I
want you up stairs.\xE2\x80\x9D And, gathering her work together, she was hastening
away, when Elizabeth called out:

\xE2\x80\x9CDear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse
me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am
going away myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.\xE2\x80\x9D And upon
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
escape, she added: \xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.
Collins.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment\xE2\x80\x99s
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to
conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
they were gone, Mr. Collins began.

\xE2\x80\x9CBelieve me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
mother\xE2\x80\x99s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of
my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\xE2\x80\x9D

The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could
not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,
and he continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will
add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought
to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh\xE2\x80\x99s footstool, that she said, \xE2\x80\x98Mr. Collins, you
must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose
a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\xE2\x80\x99 Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice
and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond
anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not
be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and
I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother\xE2\x80\x99s
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are too hasty, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D she cried. \xE2\x80\x9CYou forget that I have made no
answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not now to learn,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cyour hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWere it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Collins
very gravely--\xE2\x80\x9Cbut I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of
seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may
be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\xE2\x80\x9D And rising as she
thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus
addressed her:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CReally, Mr. Collins,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou puzzle me
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you of its being one.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking
the truth from her heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are uniformly charming!\xE2\x80\x9D cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable.\xE2\x80\x9D

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make
no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if
he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.



Chapter 20


Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will
_make_ her know it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPardon me for interrupting you, madam,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Collins; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut if
she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSir, you quite misunderstand me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \xE2\x80\x9CLizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\xE2\x80\x9D

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library, \xE2\x80\x9COh! Mr. Bennet, you
are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make
Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, when she had
finished her speech. \xE2\x80\x9COf what are you talking?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome here, child,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her father as she appeared. \xE2\x80\x9CI have sent for
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\xE2\x80\x9D Elizabeth replied that it was.
\xE2\x80\x9CVery well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, or I will never see her again.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to
_insist_ upon her marrying him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear,\xE2\x80\x9D replied her husband, \xE2\x80\x9CI have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be.\xE2\x80\x9D

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane
in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother\xE2\x80\x99s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, \xE2\x80\x9CI am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family. \xE2\x80\x9CPray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\xE2\x80\x9D she added in a melancholy tone,
\xE2\x80\x9Cfor nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves.\xE2\x80\x9D

Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CAye, there she comes,\xE2\x80\x9D continued Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Clooking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to
the girls, \xE2\x80\x9CNow, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold
your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation
together.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected
conversation: \xE2\x80\x9COh! Mr. Collins!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear madam,\xE2\x80\x9D replied he, \xE2\x80\x9Clet us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me,\xE2\x80\x9D he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
displeasure, \xE2\x80\x9Cto resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;
and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughter\xE2\x80\x99s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter\xE2\x80\x99s lips instead of your own. But we are all
liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 21


The discussion of Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly
expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke
to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s ill-humour or ill
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.

After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunt\xE2\x80\x99s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI found,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cas the time drew near that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to
her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\xE2\x80\x99s fair, flowing hand; and
Elizabeth saw her sister\xE2\x80\x99s countenance change as she read it, and saw
her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected
herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no
sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,
Jane, taking out the letter, said:

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on
their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You
shall hear what she says.\xE2\x80\x9D

She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a
house. The next was in these words: \xE2\x80\x9CI do not pretend to regret anything
I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;
but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
correspondence. I depend on you for that.\xE2\x80\x9D To these highflown
expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw
nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to
regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is unlucky,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, after a short pause, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCaroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my
dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of
that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of whom we shall deprive you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is evident by this,\xE2\x80\x9D added Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he comes back no more this
winter.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own
master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,
_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think
Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister\xE2\x80\x99s
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman\xE2\x80\x99s heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane as she
finished it. \xE2\x80\x9CIs it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that
Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is
perfectly convinced of her brother\xE2\x80\x99s indifference; and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMost willingly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him
to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane shook her head.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She
is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and
I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cyour
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
herself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must decide for yourself,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cand if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow can you talk so?\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, faintly smiling. \xE2\x80\x9CYou must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!\xE2\x80\x9D

The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline\xE2\x80\x99s
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.

She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane\xE2\x80\x99s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.

They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had
been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two
full courses.



Chapter 22


The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. \xE2\x80\x9CIt keeps him in good
humour,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I am more obliged to you than I can express.\xE2\x80\x9D
 Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
very amiable, but Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her
from any return of Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. Such was Miss Lucas\xE2\x80\x99s scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very
soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

In as short a time as Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.

Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St. James\xE2\x80\x99s. The whole family, in short,
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were
in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible
nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must
be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was
the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,
and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at
the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all
the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship
she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,
and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved
to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.

As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,
said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever
his engagements might allow him to visit them.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear madam,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible.\xE2\x80\x9D

They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said:

\xE2\x80\x9CBut is there not danger of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s disapprobation here, my
good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear sir,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Collins, \xE2\x80\x9CI am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s concurrence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBelieve me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my
cousin Elizabeth.\xE2\x80\x9D

With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

The possibility of Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she could not help crying out:

\xE2\x80\x9CEngaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!\xE2\x80\x9D

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\xE2\x80\x99s good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\xE2\x80\x9D

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her
all imaginable happiness.

\xE2\x80\x9CI see what you are feeling,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Charlotte. \xE2\x80\x9CYou must be surprised,
very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never
was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s
character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth quietly answered \xE2\x80\x9CUndoubtedly;\xE2\x80\x9D and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a
most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
chosen.



Chapter 23


Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but
incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and
often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:

\xE2\x80\x9CGood Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William\xE2\x80\x99s good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.

Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be
happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.

Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!

Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty
and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.

Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,
as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to
their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth\xE2\x80\x99s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.

Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and
they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s continued
absence.

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as
she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s happiness, and so
dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.

As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed
all Jane\xE2\x80\x99s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight
of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
not for the entail, I should not mind it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat should not you mind?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should not mind anything at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\xE2\x80\x99s own
daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!
Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI leave it to yourself to determine,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet.



Chapter 24


Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother\xE2\x80\x99s regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest
of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s praise occupied
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother\xE2\x80\x99s being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.

Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline\xE2\x80\x99s
assertion of her brother\xE2\x80\x99s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,
been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best, but her sister\xE2\x80\x99s was involved in it, as
she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,
on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends\xE2\x80\x99 interference; whether
he had been aware of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister\xE2\x80\x99s situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.

A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying:

\xE2\x80\x9COh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But
I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou doubt me,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Jane, slightly colouring; \xE2\x80\x9Cindeed, you have
no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.\xE2\x80\x9D

With a stronger voice she soon added, \xE2\x80\x9CI have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Jane!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say
to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister\xE2\x80\x99s warm affection.

\xE2\x80\x9CNay,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not
be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the
other is Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is
unaccountable!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s respectability, and
Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody\xE2\x80\x99s sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as
I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him
cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though
it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\xE2\x80\x9D replied
Jane; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd men take care that they should.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s conduct to design,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people\xE2\x80\x99s feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do you impute it to either of those?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, in conjunction with his friend.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can
only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBeyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane;
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother\xE2\x80\x99s. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what
I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in
the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with
less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her
no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s best
comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \xE2\x80\x9CSo, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he one day,
\xE2\x80\x9Cyour sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
all expect Jane\xE2\x80\x99s good fortune.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
the most of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.

Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society
of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.



Chapter 25


After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,
Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his
relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another
letter of thanks.

On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas
at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
They had frequently been staying with her in town.

The first part of Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was
nothing in it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not blame Jane,\xE2\x80\x9D she continued, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s wife by this time, had it not
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,
in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.

When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \xE2\x80\x9CIt
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CI am
sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAn excellent consolation in its way,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it will not
do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut that expression of \xE2\x80\x98violently in love\xE2\x80\x99 is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\xE2\x80\x99s acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s
love?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be
of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister\xE2\x80\x99s ready acquiescence.

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope,\xE2\x80\x9D added Mrs. Gardiner, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such
a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
would hardly think a month\xE2\x80\x99s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe will drop the acquaintance entirely.\xE2\x80\x9D

But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s
attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt\xE2\x80\x99s invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she
hoped by Caroline\xE2\x80\x99s not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.

The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s
warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,
from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and
she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.

To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher
intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
procuring.

Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both
him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and
was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam
Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.



Chapter 26


Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CElizabeth, you are not serious now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father\xE2\x80\x99s opinion of me does
me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,
I will do my best.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs I did the other day,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: \xE2\x80\x9Cvery
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother\xE2\x80\x99s ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope
you are satisfied.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that
she \xE2\x80\x9C_wished_ they might be happy.\xE2\x80\x9D Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she
rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\xE2\x80\x99s ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_That_ you certainly shall.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy father and Maria are coming to me in March,\xE2\x80\x9D added Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I
hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
welcome as either of them.\xE2\x80\x9D

The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on
the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
lost.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy aunt,\xE2\x80\x9D she continued, \xE2\x80\x9Cis going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\xE2\x80\x9D

She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
\xE2\x80\x9CI did not think Caroline in spirits,\xE2\x80\x9D were her words, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached
her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
see them soon here.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\xE2\x80\x99s being in town.

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
prove what she felt.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s regard for me. But, my dear sister,
though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I
receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that
she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not
calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was
in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,
though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out
as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting
wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know
this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily
account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to
his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,
because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said
herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield
again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better
not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on
every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s sister, as by Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.

Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on: \xE2\x80\x9CI am now convinced, my dear aunt, that
I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure
and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and
wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to
think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the
ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 27


With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There
was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s first sketch. She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement
of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.

The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of
what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known Sir William\xE2\x80\x99s too long. He could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
worn out, like his information.

It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin\xE2\x80\x99s appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen
her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,
to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s visit in Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.

Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut my dear Elizabeth,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat sort of girl is Miss King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\xE2\x80\x99s death
made her mistress of this fortune.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
so soon after this event.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Chave it as you choose. _He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTake care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\xE2\x80\x9D

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have not determined how far it shall carry us,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Gardiner,
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut, perhaps, to the Lakes.\xE2\x80\x9D

No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. \xE2\x80\x9COh, my dear,
dear aunt,\xE2\x80\x9D she rapturously cried, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat delight! what felicity! You
give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What
are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport
we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other
travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We
_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.
Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
travellers.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 28


Every object in the next day\xE2\x80\x99s journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
instantly that her cousin\xE2\x80\x99s manners were not altered by his marriage;
his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they
were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife\xE2\x80\x99s
offers of refreshment.

Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its
aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But
though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to
gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her
eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but
in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to
the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the
prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome
modern building, well situated on rising ground.

From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband\xE2\x80\x99s
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.

She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed:

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed
to walk home. Her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s carriages, for she has several.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D added
Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9Cand a most attentive neighbour.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\xE2\x80\x9D

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.

About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened
the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out--

\xE2\x80\x9COh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
haste, and come down this moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in
quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd is this all?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CI expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLa! my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is not
Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;
the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not come in?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI like her appearance,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \xE2\x80\x9CShe
looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
make him a very proper wife.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that
way.

At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.



Chapter 29


Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.

\xE2\x80\x9CI confess,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately
after your arrival!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am the less surprised at what has happened,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Sir William,
\xE2\x80\x9Cfrom that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\xE2\x80\x9D

Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.

When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--

\xE2\x80\x9CDo not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.\xE2\x80\x9D

While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at St. James\xE2\x80\x99s.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.

When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\xE2\x80\x99s alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady
Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
she could witness without trepidation.

From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady
Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,
with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.

In spite of having been at St. James\xE2\x80\x99s, Sir William was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by
silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,
as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.

When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria\xE2\x80\x99s astonishment at her
being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.

After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.

The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had
likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her
ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing
she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to
have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady\xE2\x80\x99s attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse
with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been
her mother\xE2\x80\x99s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then
observed,

\xE2\x80\x9CYour father\xE2\x80\x99s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
sake,\xE2\x80\x9D turning to Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9CI am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\xE2\x80\x99s family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA little.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COne of them does.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do
you draw?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, not at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat, none of you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot one.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHas your governess left you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe never had any governess.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
the case.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you
must have been neglected.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCompared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,
who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf\xE2\x80\x99s
calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. \xE2\x80\x98Lady
Catherine,\xE2\x80\x99 said she, \xE2\x80\x98you have given me a treasure.\xE2\x80\x99 Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters
must be very young?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be
much in company. But really, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word,\xE2\x80\x9D said her ladyship, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith three younger sisters grown up,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, smiling, \xE2\x80\x9Cyour
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not
conceal your age.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not one-and-twenty.\xE2\x80\x9D

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh\xE2\x80\x99s being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.

When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by
the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins\xE2\x80\x99s side and as many bows on Sir William\xE2\x80\x99s they departed. As soon
as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin
to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for
Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her
commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy
Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s praise
into his own hands.



Chapter 30


Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s being most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,
which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and
had a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99 conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon to get out.

Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s joints of meat were too large for her family.

Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.

The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s reach. This,
however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she
frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s curiosity.

In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not
many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently
destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.

His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his
bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen
them from her husband\xE2\x80\x99s room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:

\xE2\x80\x9CI may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him without saying a word.

Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment\xE2\x80\x99s pause, added:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
happened to see her there?\xE2\x80\x9D

She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.



Chapter 31


Colonel Fitzwilliam\xE2\x80\x99s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen\xE2\x80\x99s arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the
Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen
only at church.

The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s drawing-room. Her ladyship received
them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.

Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,
as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe are speaking of music, madam,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.

\xE2\x80\x9COf music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,
I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\xE2\x80\x99s proficiency.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lady
Catherine; \xE2\x80\x9Cand pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI assure you, madam,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat she does not need such advice.
She practises very constantly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she
will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told
her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
Jenkinson\xE2\x80\x99s room. She would be in nobody\xE2\x80\x99s way, you know, in that part
of the house.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\xE2\x80\x99s ill-breeding, and made
no answer.

When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away
from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer\xE2\x80\x99s
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall not say you are mistaken,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, \xE2\x80\x9CYour cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part
of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to
say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not afraid of you,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, smilingly.

\xE2\x80\x9CPray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. \xE2\x80\x9CI should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced
only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9CI should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \xE2\x80\x9CShall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can answer your question,\xE2\x80\x9D said Fitzwilliam, \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout applying to
him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy,
\xE2\x80\x9Cof conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy fingers,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cdo not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women\xE2\x80\x99s do. They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the
trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman\xE2\x80\x99s of superior execution.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy smiled and said, \xE2\x80\x9CYou are perfectly right. You have employed your
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\xE2\x80\x9D

Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy:

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne\xE2\x80\x99s. Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin\xE2\x80\x99s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.

Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s carriage was
ready to take them all home.



Chapter 32


Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to
be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
to be within.

They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and
feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed:

\xE2\x80\x9CHow very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerfectly so, I thank you.\xE2\x80\x9D

She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
pause added:

\xE2\x80\x9CI think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for
the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
principle.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should not be surprised,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Cif he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.

He took the hint, and soon began with, \xE2\x80\x9CThis seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the
wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAn easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day\xE2\x80\x99s
journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CI should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her family.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\xE2\x80\x9D

As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \xE2\x80\x9C_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you pleased with Kent?\xE2\x80\x9D

A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to anybody, went away.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat can be the meaning of this?\xE2\x80\x9D said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. \xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
have called us in this familiar way.\xE2\x80\x9D

But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\xE2\x80\x99s manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.

But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice
to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
Fitzwilliam\xE2\x80\x99s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend\xE2\x80\x99s dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.


In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.



Chapter 33


More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about
her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s happiness; and that in speaking of
Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel
Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed
her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.

She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\xE2\x80\x99s last letter,
and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw
on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI did not know before that you ever walked this way.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been making the tour of the park,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cas I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
you going much farther?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I should have turned in a moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\xE2\x80\x9D said she.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe likes to have his own way very well,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
\xE2\x80\x9CBut so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it
than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThese are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where
they like.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs this,\xE2\x80\x9D thought Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cmeant for me?\xE2\x80\x9D and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \xE2\x80\x9CAnd pray, what
is the usual price of an earl\xE2\x80\x99s younger son? Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\xE2\x80\x9D

He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat is an advantage which he must
divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.\xE2\x80\x9D

As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he
is a great friend of Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! yes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth drily; \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCare of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
because if it were to get round to the lady\xE2\x80\x99s family, it would be an
unpleasant thing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may depend upon my not mentioning it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing
him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what arts did he use to separate them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe did not talk to me of his own arts,\xE2\x80\x9D said Fitzwilliam, smiling. \xE2\x80\x9CHe
only told me what I have now told you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am thinking of what you have been telling me,\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CYour
cousin\xE2\x80\x99s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend\xE2\x80\x99s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.
But,\xE2\x80\x9D she continued, recollecting herself, \xE2\x80\x9Cas we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is not an unnatural surmise,\xE2\x80\x9D said Fitzwilliam, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousin\xE2\x80\x99s triumph very sadly.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture
of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had
always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was
the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had
suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the
world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere were some very strong objections against the lady,\xE2\x80\x9D were Colonel
Fitzwilliam\xE2\x80\x99s words; and those strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo Jane herself,\xE2\x80\x9D she exclaimed, \xE2\x80\x9Cthere could be no possibility of
objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither
could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and
respectability which he will probably never reach.\xE2\x80\x9D When she thought of
her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow
that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friend\xE2\x80\x99s connections, than from their want of sense;
and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.
Bingley for his sister.

The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s being rather
displeased by her staying at home.



Chapter 34


When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her
a keener sense of her sister\xE2\x80\x99s sufferings. It was some consolation
to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the
next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should
herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her spirits, by all that affection could do.

She could not think of Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s leaving Kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.

While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitated manner, and thus began:

\xE2\x80\x9CIn vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;
and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,
immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.

In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man\xE2\x80\x99s affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she
lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite
of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt
of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but
his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said:

\xE2\x80\x9CIn such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should
be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be
of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance
of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s feelings
dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!
I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI might as well inquire,\xE2\x80\x9D replied she, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against
you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
beloved sister?\xE2\x80\x9D

As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CI have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind.\xE2\x80\x9D

She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

\xE2\x80\x9CCan you deny that you have done it?\xE2\x80\x9D she repeated.

With assumed tranquillity he then replied: \xE2\x80\x9CI have no wish of denying
that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it is not merely this affair,\xE2\x80\x9D she continued, \xE2\x80\x9Con which my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou take an eager interest in that gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s concerns,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

\xE2\x80\x9CWho that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHis misfortunes!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Darcy contemptuously; \xE2\x80\x9Cyes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd of your infliction,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth with energy. \xE2\x80\x9CYou have reduced
him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
ridicule.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd this,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
\xE2\x80\x9Cis your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\xE2\x80\x9D added he, stopping in
his walk, and turning towards her, \xE2\x80\x9Cthese offenses might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner.\xE2\x80\x9D

She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
would have tempted me to accept it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of
my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.\xE2\x80\x9D

And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how
to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,
was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for
so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
all the objections which had made him prevent his friend\xE2\x80\x99s marrying
her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his
own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable
pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could
not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.
Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the
sound of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
encounter Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s observation, and hurried her away to her room.



Chapter 35


Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after
breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.

After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.
Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though
in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,
\xE2\x80\x9CI have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?\xE2\x80\x9D And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.

With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

\xE2\x80\x9CBe not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
demand it of your justice.

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which
is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity
must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.

\xE2\x80\x9CI had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance
at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I
had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
William Lucas\xE2\x80\x99s accidental information, that Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could
be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour
attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss
Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also
watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,
but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
from the evening\xE2\x80\x99s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been
in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not
scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister\xE2\x80\x99s countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be
easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe
her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But
there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still
existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had
myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your
mother\xE2\x80\x99s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say
farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties
was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters\xE2\x80\x99 uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I
described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your
sister\xE2\x80\x99s indifference. He had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was
no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into
Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the
work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not
reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister\xE2\x80\x99s being in
town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her
brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it
was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no
other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister\xE2\x80\x99s feelings, it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
them.

\xE2\x80\x9CWith respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I
am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
than one witness of undoubted veracity.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many
years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at
school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his
own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
been unable to give him a gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s education. My father was not only
fond of this young man\xE2\x80\x99s society, whose manners were always engaging; he
had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be
his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is
many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different
manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,
and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.
Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree
you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham
has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to
Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham
wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,
he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he
could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying
law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed
him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to
his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the
business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him
to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured
me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He
had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was
well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not
have forgotten my revered father\xE2\x80\x99s intentions. You will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every
repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.

\xE2\x80\x9CI must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to
the guardianship of my mother\xE2\x80\x99s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed
for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by
design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and
by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and
to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed
the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and
how I acted. Regard for my sister\xE2\x80\x99s credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s chief object was unquestionably my sister\xE2\x80\x99s fortune, which
is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have
been complete indeed.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he
had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,
detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but
I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our
near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of
the executors of my father\xE2\x80\x99s will, has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_
should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning. I will only add, God bless you.

\xE2\x80\x9CFITZWILLIAM DARCY\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 36


If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation
to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what
had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly
left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister\xE2\x80\x99s insensibility she
instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst
objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing
him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and
insolence.

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \xE2\x80\x9CThis must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\xE2\x80\x9D--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.

In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own
words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the
will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down
the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read
on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As
to his real character, had information been in her power, she had
never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried
to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of
Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years\xE2\x80\x99 continuance. But
no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss
Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin\xE2\x80\x99s affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin\xE2\x80\x99s corroboration.

She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips\xE2\x80\x99s.
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;
that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son.

How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his
actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,
absurd.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow despicably I have acted!\xE2\x80\x9D she cried; \xE2\x80\x9CI, who have prided myself
on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this
discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my
folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sister\xE2\x80\x99s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s
opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his
description of Jane. She felt that Jane\xE2\x80\x99s feelings, though fervent, were
little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air
and manner not often united with great sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.

The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered
that Jane\xE2\x80\x99s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made
her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.

She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern
in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object; she could think only of her letter.



Chapter 37


The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.

Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s indignation would have been. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat would she have said? how
would she have behaved?\xE2\x80\x9D were questions with which she amused herself.

Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. \xE2\x80\x9CI assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lady Catherine; \xE2\x80\x9CI believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to
me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The
dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His
attachment to Rosings certainly increases.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\xE2\x80\x9D replied
Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
next Saturday.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lady Catherine seemed resigned. \xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Collins, you must send a servant
with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.
You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my
niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of
Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those
things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I
am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy uncle is to send a servant for us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?
Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
attended to.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary
walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.

Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother\xE2\x80\x99s indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there
forever.

Anxiety on Jane\xE2\x80\x99s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved
to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!

When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.



Chapter 38


On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know not, Miss Elizabeth,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
solemnity replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CIt gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,
from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to
Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You
see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are
sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\xE2\x80\x9D

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so. Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
other.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she
had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that
her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her
home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their
dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut,\xE2\x80\x9D he added, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood gracious!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Maria, after a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99 silence, \xE2\x80\x9Cit seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA great many indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D said her companion with a sigh.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth added privately, \xE2\x80\x9CAnd how much I shall have to conceal!\xE2\x80\x9D

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s
house, where they were to remain a few days.

Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s proposals. To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried
into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister
further.



Chapter 39


It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s carriage
was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman\xE2\x80\x99s
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.

After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
\xE2\x80\x9CIs not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd we mean to treat you all,\xE2\x80\x9D added Lydia, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.\xE2\x80\x9D Then, showing
her purchases--\xE2\x80\x9CLook here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better.\xE2\x80\x9D

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, \xE2\x80\x9COh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre they indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;
and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to
go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D thought Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9C_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow I have got some news for you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lydia, as they sat down at
table. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about
a certain person we all like!\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CAye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
There is no danger of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s marrying Mary King. There\xE2\x80\x99s for you! She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Mary King is safe!\xE2\x80\x9D added Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Csafe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled
thing?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!

As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty\xE2\x80\x99s and
Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s purchases, were seated in it.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow nicely we are all crammed in,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Lydia. \xE2\x80\x9CI am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you can\xE2\x80\x99t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster\xE2\x80\x99s. Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\xE2\x80\x99s clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\xE2\x80\x9D

With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty\xE2\x80\x99s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s name.

Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\xE2\x80\x9D

Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that
occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat
some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\xE2\x80\x99s,
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Mary,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there
was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty
had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved
very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated
you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never
should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then
we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off!\xE2\x80\x9D

To this Mary very gravely replied, \xE2\x80\x9CFar be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for
_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.\xE2\x80\x9D

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.
Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The
comfort to _her_ of the regiment\xE2\x80\x99s approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.

She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.



Chapter 40


Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every
particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be
surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
between Mr. Darcy and herself.

Miss Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister\xE2\x80\x99s refusal must have given him.

\xE2\x80\x9CHis being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cand certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9CI am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBlame you! Oh, no.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
day.\xE2\x80\x9D

She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear the one without involving the other.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis will not do,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s;
but you shall do as you choose.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not know when I have been more shocked,\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CWickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing
of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPoor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one\xE2\x80\x99s genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say
that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I
had! Oh! how I wanted you!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There
is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s character.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \xE2\x80\x9CSurely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me
to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy
is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal
to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At
present I will say nothing about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\xE2\x80\x9D

The tumult of Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other
half of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one
could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd then,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cif that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to
tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!\xE2\x80\x9D

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister\xE2\x80\x99s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself
in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,
and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first
attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,
and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her
attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
health and their tranquillity.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet one day, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s? For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But
I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is
a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there\xE2\x80\x99s the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of
his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I
would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\xE2\x80\x9D

But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D continued her mother, soon afterwards, \xE2\x80\x9Cand so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her
mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, nothing at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as
quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was a subject which they could not mention before me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 41


The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the regiment\xE2\x80\x99s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?\xE2\x80\x9D would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \xE2\x80\x9CHow can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years
ago.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI cried for two days together when Colonel
Miller\xE2\x80\x99s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure I shall break _mine_,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lydia.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf one could but go to Brighton!\xE2\x80\x9D observed Mrs. Bennet.

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\xE2\x80\x9D
 added Kitty.

Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.

But the gloom of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of
the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months\xE2\x80\x99 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\xE2\x80\x99s feelings, Lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\xE2\x80\x99s
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said she, \xE2\x80\x9CThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\xE2\x80\x9D

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:

\xE2\x80\x9CLydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you were aware,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cof the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s unguarded and
imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAlready arisen?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Mr. Bennet. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat, has she frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s folly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger
Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply:

\xE2\x80\x9CDo not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
of her life.\xE2\x80\x9D

With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on
them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret
over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.

Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. In Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.

Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have
been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
conviction of her husband\xE2\x80\x99s never intending to go there himself.

But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s leaving
home.

Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.

On the very last day of the regiment\xE2\x80\x99s remaining at Meryton, he dined,
with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\xE2\x80\x99s and Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.

He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\xE2\x80\x99s
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:

\xE2\x80\x9CHow long did you say he was at Rosings?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNearly three weeks.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you saw him frequently?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, almost every day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHis manners are very different from his cousin\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd
pray, may I ask?--\xE2\x80\x9D But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, \xE2\x80\x9CIs
it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,\xE2\x80\x9D he continued in a lower
and more serious tone, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he is improved in essentials.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, no!\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CIn essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was.\xE2\x80\x9D

While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\xE2\x80\x9D

Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been
alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always
operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I
am certain he has very much at heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his
side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.

When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in
the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.



Chapter 42


Had Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been
looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it is fortunate,\xE2\x80\x9D thought she, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I have something to wish for.
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister\xE2\x80\x99s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation.\xE2\x80\x9D

When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to
the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still
less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public.

After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of
June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by
the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.

The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.

Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. \xE2\x80\x9CBut surely,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\xE2\x80\x9D

The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt\xE2\x80\x99s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the
next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.

It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s
former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,
Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not
in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much?\xE2\x80\x9D said her aunt; \xE2\x80\x9Ca place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so
many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \xE2\x80\x9CIf it were merely a fine house
richly furnished,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI should not care about it myself; but
the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
country.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its
proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.



Chapter 43


Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.

The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which
they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,
was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and
she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,
with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be
seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of
his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd of this place,\xE2\x80\x9D thought she, \xE2\x80\x9CI might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,\xE2\x80\x9D--recollecting
herself--\xE2\x80\x9Cthat could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like
regret.

She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question
was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.
Reynolds replied that he was, adding, \xE2\x80\x9CBut we expect him to-morrow, with
a large party of friends.\xE2\x80\x9D How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the
likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman, the son of her late master\xE2\x80\x99s steward, who had been brought
up by him at his own expense. \xE2\x80\x9CHe is now gone into the army,\xE2\x80\x9D she added;
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd that,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
\xE2\x80\x9Cis my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have heard much of your master\xE2\x80\x99s fine person,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture; \xE2\x80\x9Cit is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.

\xE2\x80\x9CDoes that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth coloured, and said: \xE2\x80\x9CA little.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\xE2\x80\x99am?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, very handsome.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
master\xE2\x80\x99s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. He was very fond of them.\xE2\x80\x9D

This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s being among them.

Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Gardiner.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CExcept,\xE2\x80\x9D thought Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen she goes to Ramsgate.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf your master would marry, you might see more of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
good enough for him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \xE2\x80\x9CIt is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,\xE2\x80\x9D
 replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \xE2\x80\x9CI have
never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever
since he was four years old.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was
grateful to her uncle for saying:

\xE2\x80\x9CThere are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
having such a master.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could
not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and
he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
world.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth almost stared at her. \xE2\x80\x9CCan this be Mr. Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D thought she.

\xE2\x80\x9CHis father was an excellent man,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Gardiner.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is the best landlord, and the best master,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat ever
lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw
anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away
like other young men.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn what an amiable light does this place him!\xE2\x80\x9D thought Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis fine account of him,\xE2\x80\x9D whispered her aunt as they walked, \xE2\x80\x9Cis not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps we might be deceived.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is not very likely; our authority was too good.\xE2\x80\x9D

On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when
last at Pemberley.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is certainly a good brother,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.

Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s delight, when she should enter
the room. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd this is always the way with him,\xE2\x80\x9D she added. \xE2\x80\x9CWhatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There
is nothing he would not do for her.\xE2\x80\x9D

The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were
all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.

In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested
her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest
contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\xE2\x80\x99s
lifetime.

There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people\xE2\x80\x99s happiness were in his guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his
eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.

When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.

As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.

They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.

She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener\xE2\x80\x99s expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent
had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in
Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.

At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.

The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but
Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,
followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her
coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the
world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely
thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he
thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;
for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted
from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly
altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was
amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What
a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put
his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account
for it.

They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and
seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.

At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the
valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading
many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.
With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which
brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,
to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed
it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the
valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the
bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the
man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before
they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared
for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words \xE2\x80\x9Cdelightful,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ccharming,\xE2\x80\x9D when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,
and she said no more.

Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat will be his surprise,\xE2\x80\x9D thought
she, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of
fashion.\xE2\x80\x9D

The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and
so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.

The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time
to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment
must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and
continually was she repeating, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy is he so altered? From what can
it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his
manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a
change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\xE2\x80\x9D

After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated
in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband\xE2\x80\x99s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--\xE2\x80\x9Cfor your housekeeper,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cinformed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country.\xE2\x80\x9D He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \xE2\x80\x9CThey
will join me early to-morrow,\xE2\x80\x9D he continued, \xE2\x80\x9Cand among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s name had been the last
mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_
mind was not very differently engaged.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is also one other person in the party,\xE2\x80\x9D he continued after a
pause, \xE2\x80\x9Cwho more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?\xE2\x80\x9D

The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.

They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected
that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was
over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house.

The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
\xE2\x80\x9CHe is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\xE2\x80\x9D said her uncle.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,\xE2\x80\x9D replied her
aunt, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
have seen nothing of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo be sure, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said her aunt, \xE2\x80\x9Che is not so handsome as Wickham;
or, rather, he has not Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s countenance, for his features
are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so
disagreeable?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\xE2\x80\x9D replied
her uncle. \xE2\x80\x9CYour great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off
his grounds.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but
said nothing.

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom what we have seen of him,\xE2\x80\x9D continued Mrs. Gardiner, \xE2\x80\x9CI really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal
master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every
virtue.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in
as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from
his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning\xE2\x80\x99s walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
intercourse renewed after many years\xE2\x80\x99 discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s civility, and, above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.



Chapter 44


Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite
amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.

Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.

Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.

They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley
was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s quick
step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked
and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.

To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love. Of the lady\xE2\x80\x99s sensations they remained a little
in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.

Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and
to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.

In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point
she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a
recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed
to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone
which had something of real regret, that it \xE2\x80\x9Cwas a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her;\xE2\x80\x9D and, before she could reply,
he added, \xE2\x80\x9CIt is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of
November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.

It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;
but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was
so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations
at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance
could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.

Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.

Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant\xE2\x80\x99s report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town
where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She
certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in
his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.
It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid
her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most
eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display
of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only
were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent
on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent
love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,
she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her
fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of
his addresses.

It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s in coming to see them on the
very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a
late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when
she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.



Chapter 45


Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how
much civility on that lady\xE2\x80\x99s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.

On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London. Georgiana\xE2\x80\x99s reception of them was very civil, but attended with
all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear
of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,
however, did her justice, and pitied her.

By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.

Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected
them round the table.

While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.

He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother\xE2\x80\x99s
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:

\xE2\x80\x9CPray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family.\xE2\x80\x9D

In Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s presence she dared not mention Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment\xE2\x80\x99s distress;
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While
she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very
wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.

Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s person,
behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\xE2\x80\x99s
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not
err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D she
cried; \xE2\x80\x9CI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing
that we should not have known her again.\xE2\x80\x9D

However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.

\xE2\x80\x9CFor my own part,\xE2\x80\x9D she rejoined, \xE2\x80\x9CI must confess that I never could
see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose
wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,
which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do
not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable.\xE2\x80\x9D

Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CI remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, \xE2\x80\x98_She_
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.\xE2\x80\x99 But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut _that_
was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\xE2\x80\x9D

He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but
himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece\xE2\x80\x99s
beginning the subject.



Chapter 46


Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:

\xE2\x80\x9CSince writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing
to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step
(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against
him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
know what I have written.\xE2\x80\x9D

Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

\xE2\x80\x9CBy this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest
Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,
and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham
and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the
day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s short
letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna
Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was
repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.
intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,
but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney
coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that
is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.
I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that
side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but
without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With
the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions
to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved
for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our
distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the
worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make
it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a
young woman of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that
Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his
head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to
be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she
exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And
as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has
anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of
confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the
first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not
so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I
take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but
circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to
come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,
that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something
more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel
Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure
I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any
measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to
be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my
uncle\xE2\x80\x99s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will
immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! where, where is my uncle?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing
a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,
she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s situation,
hastily exclaimed, \xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not
an instant to lose.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood God! what is the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, \xE2\x80\x9CI will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless
an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly.

On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
\xE2\x80\x9CLet me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I thank you,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \xE2\x80\x9CThere
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\xE2\x80\x9D

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence. At length she spoke again. \xE2\x80\x9CI have just had a letter from Jane,
with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger
sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into
the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no
connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy was fixed in astonishment. \xE2\x80\x9CWhen I consider,\xE2\x80\x9D she added in a yet
more agitated voice, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I might have prevented it! I, who knew what
he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I
learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
have happened. But it is all--all too late now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am grieved indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Darcy; \xE2\x80\x9Cgrieved--shocked. But is it
certain--absolutely certain?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle\xE2\x80\x99s
immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But
nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is
such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much. Wretched, wretched mistake!\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her
power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.

But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed
up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I
fear, prevent my sister\xE2\x80\x99s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley
to-day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\xE2\x80\x9D

He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting look, went away.

As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full
of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him
go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. Never, since reading Jane\xE2\x80\x99s second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first
letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose
Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.

She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
feel it!

She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle\xE2\x80\x99s interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant\xE2\x80\x99s
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them
instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a
favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every
assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked
him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to
be off as soon as possible. \xE2\x80\x9CBut what is to be done about Pemberley?\xE2\x80\x9D
 cried Mrs. Gardiner. \xE2\x80\x9CJohn told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for
us; was it so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_That_ is all settled.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is all settled?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\xE2\x80\x9D

But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.



Chapter 47


\xE2\x80\x9CI have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\xE2\x80\x9D said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; \xE2\x80\x9Cand really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel\xE2\x80\x99s family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you really think so?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Gardiner, \xE2\x80\x9CI begin to be of your uncle\xE2\x80\x99s
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other
neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I
dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been
the case?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn the first place,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Gardiner, \xE2\x80\x9Cthere is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular
friend, you see by Jane\xE2\x80\x99s account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has
no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\xE2\x80\x99s
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat a sister\xE2\x80\x99s sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,
nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you see that Jane,\xE2\x80\x9D said her aunt, \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes not think so very ill of
Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do you really know all this?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, colouring. \xE2\x80\x9CI told you, the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight\xE2\x80\x99s time. As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could
it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was
settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening
her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
enough from my thoughts.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\xE2\x80\x9D

                          * * * * *

It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night
on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.

The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her
mother\xE2\x80\x99s apartment, immediately met her.

Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot yet,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane. \xE2\x80\x9CBut now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
everything will be well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs my father in town?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd have you heard from him often?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd my mother--how is she? How are you all?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven, are quite well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you--how are you?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CYou look pale. How much you
must have gone through!\xE2\x80\x9D

Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of
good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.

Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must principally be owing.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I had been able,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cto carry my point in going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!
And now here\xE2\x80\x99s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,
wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become
of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we
shall do.\xE2\x80\x9D

They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo not give way to useless alarm,\xE2\x80\x9D added he; \xE2\x80\x9Cthough it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we
may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make
him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear brother,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat is exactly what I
could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my
wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such
spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does
not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I
know you will contrive it all.\xE2\x80\x9D

But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well
in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on
the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.

Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.

In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
\xE2\x80\x9CUnhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one
false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed
to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
the subject, by saying, \xE2\x80\x9CBut tell me all and everything about it which
I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CColonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of
their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt
a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister\xE2\x80\x99s happiness with him
in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s last letter
she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other, many weeks.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut not before they went to Brighton?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I believe not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does
he know his real character?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;
but I hope this may be false.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps it would have been better,\xE2\x80\x9D replied her sister. \xE2\x80\x9CBut to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCould Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s note to his
wife?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe brought it with him for us to see.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents:

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR HARRIET,

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,
I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I
love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think
it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my
going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,
when I write to them and sign my name \xE2\x80\x98Lydia Wickham.\xE2\x80\x99 What a good joke
it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to
Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will
dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall
send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell
Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
drink to our good journey.

\xE2\x80\x9CYour affectionate friend,

\xE2\x80\x9CLYDIA BENNET.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their
journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her
side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Jane,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cwas there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so
much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And
Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters\xE2\x80\x99, if
they should be of use to us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe had better have stayed at home,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cperhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see
too little of one\xE2\x80\x99s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.\xE2\x80\x9D

She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe meant I believe,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cto go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady\xE2\x80\x99s removing from one carriage into another might
be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 48


The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,
to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband\xE2\x80\x99s not being killed in a duel.

Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.

All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman\xE2\x80\x99s family.
Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister\xE2\x80\x99s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less
of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of
them.

Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a
letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;
that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,
but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised
to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:

\xE2\x80\x9CI have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man\xE2\x80\x99s intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,
Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any
other person.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never
heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both
of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of
his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application
was a something to look forward to.

Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters
was the grand object of every morning\xE2\x80\x99s impatience. Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
follows:

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR SIR,

\xE2\x80\x9CI feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in
your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that
may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parent\xE2\x80\x99s mind. The death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to
be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,
for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think
that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be
guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,
you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined
by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to
whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,
will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event
of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to
console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her
own heinous offense.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am, dear sir, etc., etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he
kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one
living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he
had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the
wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s relations, for
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.
He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more
formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \xE2\x80\x9CA gamester!\xE2\x80\x9D
 she cried. \xE2\x80\x9CThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded
to his brother-in-law\xE2\x80\x99s entreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\xE2\x80\x9D she cried. \xE2\x80\x9CSure he
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?\xE2\x80\x9D

As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.

Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and
the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their
being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.

The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.

When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.

It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, \xE2\x80\x9CSay
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must not be too severe upon yourself,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone
to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you suppose them to be in London?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; where else can they be so well concealed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Lydia used to want to go to London,\xE2\x80\x9D added Kitty.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is happy then,\xE2\x80\x9D said her father drily; \xE2\x80\x9Cand her residence there
will probably be of some duration.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then after a short silence he continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me
last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother\xE2\x80\x99s
tea.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a parade,\xE2\x80\x9D he cried, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhich does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not going to run away, papa,\xE2\x80\x9D said Kitty fretfully. \xE2\x80\x9CIf I should
ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into
my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be
absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\xE2\x80\x9D

Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, well,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cdo not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 49


Two days after Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDear madam,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half-hour, and master has had a letter.\xE2\x80\x9D

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said:

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you are looking for my master, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, he is walking towards the
little copse.\xE2\x80\x9D

Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once
more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out:

\xE2\x80\x9COh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes I have had a letter from him by express.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, and what news does it bring--good or bad?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is there of good to be expected?\xE2\x80\x9D said he, taking the letter from
his pocket. \xE2\x80\x9CBut perhaps you would like to read it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.

\xE2\x80\x9CRead it aloud,\xE2\x80\x9D said their father, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I hardly know myself what it is
about.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR BROTHER,

\xE2\x80\x9CAt last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,
upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you
left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough
to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen it is as I always hoped,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Jane; \xE2\x80\x9Cthey are married!\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth read on:

\xE2\x80\x9CI have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there
was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,
during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,
as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there
will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to
settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude
will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to
Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at
Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as
fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope
you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,

\xE2\x80\x9CEDW. GARDINER.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it possible?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \xE2\x80\x9CCan it be
possible that he will marry her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\xE2\x80\x9D said her
sister. \xE2\x80\x9CMy dear father, I congratulate you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd have you answered the letter?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; but it must be done soon.\xE2\x80\x9D

Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear father,\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, \xE2\x80\x9Ccome back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet me write for you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you dislike the trouble
yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI dislike it very much,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it must be done.\xE2\x80\x9D

And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd may I ask--\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CComplied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever
to pay him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMoney! My uncle!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat do you mean, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is very true,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cthough it had not occurred to me
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
it must be my uncle\xE2\x80\x99s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said her father; \xE2\x80\x9CWickham\xE2\x80\x99s a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd they are really to be married!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. \xE2\x80\x9CHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI comfort myself with thinking,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he certainly would
not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf he were ever able to learn what Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s debts have been,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cand how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Jane: \xE2\x80\x9CI hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to
marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTheir conduct has been such,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cas neither you, nor
I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly
replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CJust as you please.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay we take my uncle\xE2\x80\x99s letter to read to her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTake whatever you like, and get away.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s hope of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s being soon
married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, dear Lydia!\xE2\x80\x9D she cried. \xE2\x80\x9CThis is delightful indeed! She will
be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!
My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage
everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him
how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!\xE2\x80\x9D

Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour laid them all under.

\xE2\x80\x9CFor we must attribute this happy conclusion,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cin a great
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist Mr. Wickham with money.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!
In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can\xE2\x80\x99t write; so I will dictate, and
you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\xE2\x80\x9D

She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day\xE2\x80\x99s delay, she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.

\xE2\x80\x9CI will go to Meryton,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cas soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call
on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.

Poor Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was
no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had
feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had
gained.



Chapter 50


Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place.

He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s birth, had been certain that he
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then
too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband\xE2\x80\x99s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,
though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother\xE2\x80\x99s hands, Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s expenses had been very little within
that sum.

That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick
in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any
message to her.

The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant
farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery
was considered certain.

It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object
of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

\xE2\x80\x9CHaye Park might do,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cif the Gouldings could quit it--or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: \xE2\x80\x9CMrs.
Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\xE2\x80\x9D

A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter\xE2\x80\x99s nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
took place.

Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.

She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister\xE2\x80\x99s
frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,
there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other
objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.

From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.

What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.

She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she
must have received benefit of greater importance.

But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.

                          * * * * *

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was greatly my wish that he should do so,\xE2\x80\x9D he added, \xE2\x80\x9Cas soon as
his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on
his account and my niece\xE2\x80\x99s. It is Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s intention to go into
the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
ensigncy in General ----\xE2\x80\x98s regiment, now quartered in the North. It
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I
have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I
hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,
and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and her mother.--Yours, etc.,

\xE2\x80\x9CE. GARDINER.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s removal
from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet
was not so well pleased with it. Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s being settled in the North,
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,
for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cit will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----\xE2\x80\x98s
regiment.\xE2\x80\x9D

His daughter\xE2\x80\x99s request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\xE2\x80\x99s feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent
his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as
the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was
surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and
had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would
have been the last object of her wishes.



Chapter 51


Their sister\xE2\x80\x99s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to
meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure.

They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,
to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.

Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet
was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.

Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.

There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

\xE2\x80\x9COnly think of its being three months,\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, \xE2\x80\x9Csince I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \xE2\x80\x9COh! mamma, do the
people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he
should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took
off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that
he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother\xE2\x80\x99s right hand, and hear her say
to her eldest sister, \xE2\x80\x9CAh! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and
all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Wickham\xE2\x80\x9D
 by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her
ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, mamma,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, \xE2\x80\x9Cand what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half
my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don\xE2\x80\x99t
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should like it beyond anything!\xE2\x80\x9D said her mother.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thank you for my share of the favour,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands.\xE2\x80\x9D

Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.

Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected
to find it; not equal to Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s for him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.

Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.

One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You
were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo really,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9CI think there cannot be too little said
on the subject.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLa! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement\xE2\x80\x99s, because Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s lodgings were in
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o\xE2\x80\x99clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to
put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was
my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you\xE2\x80\x99ll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was
rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so
just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once
they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I
did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he
came back again in ten minutes\xE2\x80\x99 time, and then we all set out. However,
I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it was to be secret,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Csay not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! certainly,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \xE2\x80\x9Cwe will
ask you no questions.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lydia, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry.\xE2\x80\x9D

On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.

But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least
it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at
her sister\xE2\x80\x99s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may readily comprehend,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems
to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot that I _shall_, though,\xE2\x80\x9D she added to herself, as she finished
the letter; \xE2\x80\x9Cand my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane\xE2\x80\x99s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad
of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.



Chapter 52


Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it
than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to
be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.

\xE2\x80\x9CGracechurch street, Sept. 6.

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR NIECE,

\xE2\x80\x9CI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise
what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don\xE2\x80\x99t think me angry,
however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to
understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised
as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really
innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.

\xE2\x80\x9COn the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several
hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.
Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,
and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,
Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He
called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_
motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days
in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to
direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large
house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with
Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and
corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.
Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had
she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up
their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the
wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and
afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he
acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But
he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared
for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear
of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,
it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,
in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never
been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,
on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and
scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s flight on her
own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as
to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He
must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
nothing to live on.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though
Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able
to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
reasonable.

\xE2\x80\x9CEvery thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be
seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was
still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge
your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.

\xE2\x80\x9COn Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,
and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all
settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been
accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and
I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey battled it together for a long time, which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle
was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation
that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane
at most.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young
people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably
more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own
settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all
this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It
was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he
had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth
in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody\xE2\x80\x99s_ reserve,
can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,
my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another
interest_ in the affair.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who
were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in
London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were
then to receive the last finish.

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I
knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was
satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not
perceived, by Jane\xE2\x80\x99s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell
you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she
heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and
Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,
attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave
town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my
dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His
understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little
more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach
him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But
slyness seems the fashion.

\xE2\x80\x9CPray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
pair of ponies, would be the very thing.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
hour.

\xE2\x80\x9CYours, very sincerely,

\xE2\x80\x9CM. GARDINER.\xE2\x80\x9D

The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\xE2\x80\x99s
match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason
with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for
a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law
of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,
to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had
given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she
could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For
herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.
She read over her aunt\xE2\x80\x99s commendation of him again and again. It
was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some
pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she
and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between Mr. Darcy and herself.

She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one\xE2\x80\x99s
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\xE2\x80\x9D said he,
as he joined her.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou certainly do,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied with a smile; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and
now we are better.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue. Are the others coming out?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley.\xE2\x80\x9D

She replied in the affirmative.

\xE2\x80\x9CI almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, she did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what did she say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CIt must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUndoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; he introduced us to his sister.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do you like her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery much.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you go by the village of Kympton?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not recollect that we did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow should you have liked making sermons?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CExceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,
and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister\xE2\x80\x99s sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let
us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.



Chapter 53


Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.

The day of his and Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear Lydia,\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen shall we meet again?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, lord! I don\xE2\x80\x99t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWrite to me very often, my dear.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
do.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife\xE2\x80\x99s. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is as fine a fellow,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, \xE2\x80\x9Cas ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to
us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\xE2\x80\x9D

The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.

\xE2\x80\x9CI often think,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat there is nothing so bad as parting with
one\xE2\x80\x99s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CIt must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,
but only because her husband\xE2\x80\x99s regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\xE2\x80\x9D

But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
smiled and shook her head by turns.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\xE2\x80\x9D (for Mrs.
Phillips first brought her the news). \xE2\x80\x9CWell, so much the better. Not
that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am
sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome
to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may depend on it,\xE2\x80\x9D replied the other, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor Mrs. Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
going to the butcher\xE2\x80\x99s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don\xE2\x80\x99t imagine it was from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
_myself_, but I dread other people\xE2\x80\x99s remarks.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend\xE2\x80\x99s permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.

\xE2\x80\x9CYet it is hard,\xE2\x80\x9D she sometimes thought, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.

The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou
will wait on him of course.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\xE2\x80\x99s errand again.\xE2\x80\x9D

His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Tis an etiquette I despise,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CIf he wants our society,
let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. But, however, that shan\xE2\x80\x99t prevent my asking him to dine here, I
am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband\xE2\x80\x99s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--

\xE2\x80\x9CI begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane to her sister. \xE2\x80\x9CIt
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish I could say anything to comfort you,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it
is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock and ride towards the house.

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is a gentleman with him, mamma,\xE2\x80\x9D said Kitty; \xE2\x80\x9Cwho can it be?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSome acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLa!\xE2\x80\x9D replied Kitty, \xE2\x80\x9Cit looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. what\xE2\x80\x99s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s friend, without being heard by either
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.

The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.

\xE2\x80\x9CLet me first see how he behaves,\xE2\x80\x9D said she; \xE2\x80\x9Cit will then be early
enough for expectation.\xE2\x80\x9D

She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
gentlemen\xE2\x80\x99s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.

Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother\xE2\x80\x99s
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.

Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.

Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.

Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He
was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,
when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.

\xE2\x80\x9CCould I expect it to be otherwise!\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CYet why did he come?\xE2\x80\x9D

She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.

She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet.

He readily agreed to it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my
own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, \xE2\x80\x98Lately,
George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\xE2\x80\x99 without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
It was my brother Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\xE2\x80\x9D

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\xE2\x80\x9D
 continued her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay
I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have
heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said her mother,
\xE2\x80\x9CI beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe first wish of my heart,\xE2\x80\x9D said she to herself, \xE2\x80\x9Cis never more to
be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!\xE2\x80\x9D

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and
as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement.\xE2\x80\x9D

Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.

Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.



Chapter 54


As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour astonished and vexed her.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\xE2\x80\x9D said she,
\xE2\x80\x9Cdid he come at all?\xE2\x80\x9D

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If
he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will
think no more about him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, very indifferent indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, laughingly. \xE2\x80\x9COh, Jane,
take care.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

                          * * * * *

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour\xE2\x80\x99s visit, had
revived.

On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore
to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. He placed himself by her.

Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.

His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane\xE2\x80\x99s happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother\xE2\x80\x99s ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind;
and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
family.

She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious
and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf he does not come to me, _then_,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI shall give him up for
ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen\xE2\x80\x99s approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:

\xE2\x80\x9CThe men shan\xE2\x80\x99t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
do we?\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!

\xE2\x80\x9CA man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\xE2\x80\x9D

She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:

\xE2\x80\x9CIs your sister at Pemberley still?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, she will remain there till Christmas.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks.\xE2\x80\x9D

She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady\xE2\x80\x99s whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.

When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother\xE2\x80\x99s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell girls,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucases\xE2\x80\x99 last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
what do you think she said besides? \xE2\x80\x98Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last.\xE2\x80\x99 She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt has been a very agreeable day,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CThe
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet again.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth smiled.

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are very cruel,\xE2\x80\x9D said her sister, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow hard it is in some cases to be believed!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd how impossible in others!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 55


A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

\xE2\x80\x9CNext time you call,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI hope we shall be more lucky.\xE2\x80\x9D

He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.

\xE2\x80\x9CCan you come to-morrow?\xE2\x80\x9D

Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.

He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\xE2\x80\x99s room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy\xE2\x80\x99s hair.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe will be down as soon as we can,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
Where is your sash, my dear?\xE2\x80\x9D

But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.

The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of
the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is the matter mamma? What do
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\xE2\x80\x9D She then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \xE2\x80\x9CCome here, my love, I want to
speak to you,\xE2\x80\x9D took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look
at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her
entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.
Bennet half-opened the door and called out:

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was forced to go.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe may as well leave them by themselves you know;\xE2\x80\x9D said her mother, as
soon as she was in the hall. \xE2\x80\x9CKitty and I are going up stairs to sit in
my dressing-room.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.

Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.

He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s
concurrence.

Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent
the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother\xE2\x80\x99s schemes.

But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would
have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.

Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Tis too much!\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cby far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
why is not everybody as happy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,
a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said for the present.

\xE2\x80\x9CI must go instantly to my mother;\xE2\x80\x9D she cried. \xE2\x80\x9CI would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!\xE2\x80\x9D

She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd this,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cis the end of all his friend\xE2\x80\x99s anxious
circumspection! of all his sister\xE2\x80\x99s falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\xE2\x80\x9D

In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere is your sister?\xE2\x80\x9D said he hastily, as he opened the door.

\xE2\x80\x9CWith my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.\xE2\x80\x9D

He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.

It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter, and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CJane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a good girl;\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CExceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D cried his wife, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more.\xE2\x80\x9D Then addressing her daughter, \xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I shan\xE2\x80\x99t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!\xE2\x80\x9D

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
obliged to accept.

Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he
always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe has made me so happy,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, one evening, \xE2\x80\x9Cby telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
it possible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI suspected as much,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CBut how did he account for
it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt must have been his sister\xE2\x80\x99s doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is the most unforgiving speech,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s pretended regard.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWould you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty.\xE2\x80\x9D

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased
to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,
though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\xE2\x80\x9D cried
Jane. \xE2\x80\x9COh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\xE2\x80\x9D

The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,
and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.

The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.



Chapter 56


One morning, about a week after Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.

Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, madam,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
\xE2\x80\x9CShe is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man
who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have a very small park here,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then
added:

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGo, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cand show her ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.

Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow could I ever think her like her nephew?\xE2\x80\x9D said she, as she looked in
her face.

As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

\xE2\x80\x9CYou can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved
on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you believed it impossible to be true,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, \xE2\x80\x9CI wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth
coolly, \xE2\x80\x9Cwill be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never heard that it was.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,
ever induce me to be explicit.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnly this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CThe engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest
hours he was destined for his cousin?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not
be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThese are heavy misfortunes,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CBut the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CObstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will
I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person\xE2\x80\x99s
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_That_ will make your ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father\xE2\x80\x99s, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,
or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in
which you have been brought up.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s daughter; so far we are
equal.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue. You _are_ a gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s daughter. But who was your mother?
Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhatever my connections may be,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cif your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\xE2\x80\x9D

Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment\xE2\x80\x99s deliberation:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will make no promise of the kind.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that
I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance I require.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their
marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would
my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if
you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister\xE2\x80\x99s infamous
elopement. I know it all; that the young man\xE2\x80\x99s marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
such a girl to be my nephew\xE2\x80\x99s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his
late father\xE2\x80\x99s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are
you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou can now have nothing further to say,\xE2\x80\x9D she resentfully answered.
\xE2\x80\x9CYou have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house.\xE2\x80\x9D

And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are then resolved to have him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNeither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Chave any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment\xE2\x80\x99s
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.
I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.\xE2\x80\x9D

In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, \xE2\x80\x9CI take no leave
of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve
no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe did not choose it,\xE2\x80\x9D said her daughter, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe would go.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were
well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.



Chapter 57


The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report
of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours
at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time.

In revolving Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9CI shall know how to understand
it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

                          * * * * *

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.

The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI was going to look for you; come into my room.\xE2\x80\x9D

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it
might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.

She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He
then said,

\xE2\x80\x9CI have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.\xE2\x80\x9D

The colour now rushed into Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSomething very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: \xE2\x80\x98Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
this land.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CCan you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? \xE2\x80\x98This young
gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his
life! It is admirable!\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth tried to join in her father\xE2\x80\x99s pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you not diverted?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! yes. Pray read on.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\xE2\x80\x99 Mr.
Collins moreover adds, \xE2\x80\x98I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,
as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.\xE2\x80\x99 That is his notion of Christian
forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,
I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9CI am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\xE2\x80\x9D

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by
his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.



Chapter 58


Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time
to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat
in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others
to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty
was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.

They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said:

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must not blame my aunt. Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you _will_ thank me,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Clet it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
only of _you_.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, \xE2\x80\x9CYou are too generous to trifle with me. If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.

They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt taught me to hope,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cas I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \xE2\x80\x9CYes, you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CThe conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: \xE2\x80\x98had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.\xE2\x80\x99 Those were your words. You know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,
I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy mentioned his letter. \xE2\x80\x9CDid it,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cdid it soon make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?\xE2\x80\x9D

She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI knew,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I wrote that letter,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9CI believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now
so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some
of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish
being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I
was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I
was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt
by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all
that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family
circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I
was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been
but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,
I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHad you then persuaded yourself that I should?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy object then,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Cwas to show you, by every civility in
my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to
obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you.\xE2\x80\x9D

He then told her of Georgiana\xE2\x80\x99s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.

She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.

After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\xE2\x80\x9D was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI must ask whether you were surprised?\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\xE2\x80\x9D And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.

\xE2\x80\x9COn the evening before my going to London,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you speak from your own observation,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister\xE2\x80\x99s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
now.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,
and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.



Chapter 59


\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\xE2\x80\x9D was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,
and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to
say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no
one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
engaged.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane looked at her doubtingly. \xE2\x80\x9COh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as
these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\xE2\x80\x9D cried
Jane. \xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let
me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley.\xE2\x80\x9D

Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances
of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow I am quite happy,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor you will be as happy as myself.
I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,
I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it to another, not to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling
to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.

                          * * * * *

\xE2\x80\x9CGood gracious!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, \xE2\x80\x9Cif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s
way.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.

As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, \xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cto walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt may do very well for the others,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won\xE2\x80\x99t it, Kitty?\xE2\x80\x9D Kitty owned that
she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went
up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane\xE2\x80\x99s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking
to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience.\xE2\x80\x9D

During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s consent should be
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother\xE2\x80\x99s. She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear
the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.

                          * * * * *

In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her father\xE2\x80\x99s opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, \xE2\x80\x9CGo to your father, he
wants you in the library.\xE2\x80\x9D She was gone directly.

Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\xE2\x80\x9D

How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.

\xE2\x80\x9COr, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you any other objection,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cthan your belief of my
indifference?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNone at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do, I do like him,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, with tears in her eyes, \xE2\x80\x9CI love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said her father, \xE2\x80\x9CI have given him my consent. He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know
your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and
at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object
of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection
was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months\xE2\x80\x99
suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did
conquer her father\xE2\x80\x99s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, when she ceased speaking, \xE2\x80\x9CI have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.\xE2\x80\x9D

To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow\xE2\x80\x99s debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncle\xE2\x80\x99s doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\xE2\x80\x9D

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, \xE2\x80\x9CIf any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour\xE2\x80\x99s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane\xE2\x80\x99s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dearest child,\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, \xE2\x80\x9CI can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! \xE2\x80\x98Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was a sad omen of what her mother\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations\xE2\x80\x99
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to
him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her
deference for his opinion.

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.

\xE2\x80\x9CI admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CWickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 60


Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. \xE2\x80\x9CHow could
you begin?\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CI can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor the liveliness of your mind, I did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWas there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was
ill at Netherfield?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I was embarrassed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd so was I.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA man who had felt less, might.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject. This will never do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt\xE2\x80\x99s intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequence?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
befall her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be
done directly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.\xE2\x80\x9D

From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s
long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

\xE2\x80\x9CI would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your
fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you
cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,
for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your
idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I
am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours, etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply
to his last.

\xE2\x80\x9CDEAR SIR,

\xE2\x80\x9CI must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon
be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.

\xE2\x80\x9CYours sincerely, etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.

The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,
was as sincere as her brother\xE2\x80\x99s in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.

Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew\xE2\x80\x99s letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. James\xE2\x80\x99s, with very decent composure. If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

Mrs. Phillips\xE2\x80\x99s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.



Chapter 61


Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride
she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may
be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.

Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s example,
she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s being quite
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\xE2\x80\x99 beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.

As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
effect:

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR LIZZY,

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so
rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,
do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.

\xE2\x80\x9CYours, etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and
in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.

Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.

Pemberley was now Georgiana\xE2\x80\x99s home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her way. By Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s instructions, she began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait
on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xE2\x80\x99s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

ALICE\xE2\x80\x99S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

Lewis Carroll

THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0




CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
it, \xE2\x80\x98and what is the use of a book,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice \xE2\x80\x98without pictures or
conversations?\xE2\x80\x99

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \xE2\x80\x98Oh dear!
Oh dear! I shall be late!\xE2\x80\x99 (when she thought it over afterwards, it
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
she passed; it was labelled \xE2\x80\x98ORANGE MARMALADE\xE2\x80\x99, but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
she fell past it.

\xE2\x80\x98Well!\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice to herself, \xE2\x80\x98after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\xE2\x80\x99ll all think me at
home! Why, I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
of the house!\xE2\x80\x99 (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! \xE2\x80\x98I wonder how
many miles I\xE2\x80\x99ve fallen by this time?\xE2\x80\x99 she said aloud. \xE2\x80\x98I must be getting
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles down, I think--\xE2\x80\x99 (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
\xE2\x80\x98--yes, that\xE2\x80\x99s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I\xE2\x80\x99ve got to?\xE2\x80\x99 (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or
Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. \xE2\x80\x98I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the
earth! How funny it\xE2\x80\x99ll seem to come out among the people that walk with
their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--\xE2\x80\x99 (she was rather glad
there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn\xE2\x80\x99t sound at all the
right word) \xE2\x80\x98--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
is, you know. Please, Ma\xE2\x80\x99am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\xE2\x80\x99 (and
she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you\xE2\x80\x99re falling
through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \xE2\x80\x98And what an
ignorant little girl she\xE2\x80\x99ll think me for asking! No, it\xE2\x80\x99ll never do to
ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\xE2\x80\x99

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. \xE2\x80\x98Dinah\xE2\x80\x99ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\xE2\x80\x99
(Dinah was the cat.) \xE2\x80\x98I hope they\xE2\x80\x99ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
mice in the air, I\xE2\x80\x99m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\xE2\x80\x99s very
like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\xE2\x80\x99 And here Alice
began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
sort of way, \xE2\x80\x98Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\xE2\x80\x99 and sometimes, \xE2\x80\x98Do
bats eat cats?\xE2\x80\x99 for, you see, as she couldn\xE2\x80\x99t answer either question,
it didn\xE2\x80\x99t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \xE2\x80\x98Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
did you ever eat a bat?\xE2\x80\x99 when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \xE2\x80\x98Oh my ears
and whiskers, how late it\xE2\x80\x99s getting!\xE2\x80\x99 She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\xE2\x80\x99s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
doorway; \xE2\x80\x98and even if my head would go through,\xE2\x80\x99 thought poor Alice, \xE2\x80\x98it
would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\xE2\x80\x99
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, [\xE2\x80\x98which certainly was not here
before,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words \xE2\x80\x98DRINK ME\xE2\x80\x99 beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say \xE2\x80\x98Drink me,\xE2\x80\x99 but the wise little Alice was
not going to do THAT in a hurry. \xE2\x80\x98No, I\xE2\x80\x99ll look first,\xE2\x80\x99 she said, \xE2\x80\x98and
see whether it\xE2\x80\x99s marked \xE2\x80\x9Cpoison\xE2\x80\x9D or not\xE2\x80\x99; for she had read several nice
little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild
beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember
the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot
poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \xE2\x80\x98poison,\xE2\x80\x99 it is
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this bottle was NOT marked \xE2\x80\x98poison,\xE2\x80\x99 so Alice ventured to taste
it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour
of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot
buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

\xE2\x80\x98What a curious feeling!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice; \xE2\x80\x98I must be shutting up like a
telescope.\xE2\x80\x99

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; \xE2\x80\x98for it might end, you know,\xE2\x80\x99 said
Alice to herself, \xE2\x80\x98in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
what I should be like then?\xE2\x80\x99 And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.

\xE2\x80\x98Come, there\xE2\x80\x99s no use in crying like that!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice to herself,
rather sharply; \xE2\x80\x98I advise you to leave off this minute!\xE2\x80\x99 She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
\xE2\x80\x98But it\xE2\x80\x99s no use now,\xE2\x80\x99 thought poor Alice, \xE2\x80\x98to pretend to be two people!
Why, there\xE2\x80\x99s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!\xE2\x80\x99

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
\xE2\x80\x98EAT ME\xE2\x80\x99 were beautifully marked in currants. \xE2\x80\x98Well, I\xE2\x80\x99ll eat it,\xE2\x80\x99 said
Alice, \xE2\x80\x98and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\xE2\x80\x99ll
get into the garden, and I don\xE2\x80\x99t care which happens!\xE2\x80\x99

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \xE2\x80\x98Which way? Which
way?\xE2\x80\x99, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *




CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears

\xE2\x80\x98Curiouser and curiouser!\xE2\x80\x99 cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \xE2\x80\x98now I\xE2\x80\x99m
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\xE2\x80\x99
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). \xE2\x80\x98Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\xE2\x80\x99m sure
_I_ shan\xE2\x80\x99t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be
kind to them,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice, \xE2\x80\x98or perhaps they won\xE2\x80\x99t walk the way I want
to go! Let me see: I\xE2\x80\x99ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\xE2\x80\x99

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \xE2\x80\x98They must
go by the carrier,\xE2\x80\x99 she thought; \xE2\x80\x98and how funny it\xE2\x80\x99ll seem, sending
presents to one\xE2\x80\x99s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     ALICE\xE2\x80\x99S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
       HEARTHRUG,
         NEAR THE FENDER,
           (WITH ALICE\xE2\x80\x99S LOVE).

Oh dear, what nonsense I\xE2\x80\x99m talking!\xE2\x80\x99

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

\xE2\x80\x98You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, \xE2\x80\x98a great girl like
you,\xE2\x80\x99 (she might well say this), \xE2\x80\x98to go on crying in this way! Stop this
moment, I tell you!\xE2\x80\x99 But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \xE2\x80\x98Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!
Oh! won\xE2\x80\x99t she be savage if I\xE2\x80\x99ve kept her waiting!\xE2\x80\x99 Alice felt so
desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \xE2\x80\x98If you please, sir--\xE2\x80\x99
The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,
and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \xE2\x80\x98Dear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I\xE2\x80\x99ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a
little different. But if I\xE2\x80\x99m not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, THAT\xE2\x80\x99S the great puzzle!\xE2\x80\x99 And she began thinking
over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to
see if she could have been changed for any of them.

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m sure I\xE2\x80\x99m not Ada,\xE2\x80\x99 she said, \xE2\x80\x98for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn\xE2\x80\x99t go in ringlets at all; and I\xE2\x80\x99m sure I can\xE2\x80\x99t
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, SHE\xE2\x80\x99S she, and I\xE2\x80\x99m I, and--oh dear, how puzzling
it all is! I\xE2\x80\x99ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me
see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and
four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
However, the Multiplication Table doesn\xE2\x80\x99t signify: let\xE2\x80\x99s try Geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and
Rome--no, THAT\xE2\x80\x99S all wrong, I\xE2\x80\x99m certain! I must have been changed for
Mabel! I\xE2\x80\x99ll try and say \xE2\x80\x9CHow doth the little--\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99 and she crossed her
hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,
but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the
same as they used to do:--

     \xE2\x80\x98How doth the little crocodile
      Improve his shining tail,
     And pour the waters of the Nile
      On every golden scale!

     \xE2\x80\x98How cheerfully he seems to grin,
      How neatly spread his claws,
     And welcome little fishes in
      With gently smiling jaws!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m sure those are not the right words,\xE2\x80\x99 said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, \xE2\x80\x98I must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\xE2\x80\x99ve
made up my mind about it; if I\xE2\x80\x99m Mabel, I\xE2\x80\x99ll stay down here! It\xE2\x80\x99ll be no
use their putting their heads down and saying \xE2\x80\x9CCome up again, dear!\xE2\x80\x9D I
shall only look up and say \xE2\x80\x9CWho am I then? Tell me that first, and then,
if I like being that person, I\xE2\x80\x99ll come up: if not, I\xE2\x80\x99ll stay down here
till I\xE2\x80\x99m somebody else\xE2\x80\x9D--but, oh dear!\xE2\x80\x99 cried Alice, with a sudden burst
of tears, \xE2\x80\x98I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired
of being all alone here!\xE2\x80\x99

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbit\xE2\x80\x99s little white kid gloves while
she was talking. \xE2\x80\x98How CAN I have done that?\xE2\x80\x99 she thought. \xE2\x80\x98I must
be growing small again.\xE2\x80\x99 She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found
out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped
it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

\xE2\x80\x98That WAS a narrow escape!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \xE2\x80\x98and
now for the garden!\xE2\x80\x99 and she ran with all speed back to the little door:
but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was
lying on the glass table as before, \xE2\x80\x98and things are worse than ever,\xE2\x80\x99
thought the poor child, \xE2\x80\x98for I never was so small as this before, never!
And I declare it\xE2\x80\x99s too bad, that it is!\xE2\x80\x99

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she
had somehow fallen into the sea, \xE2\x80\x98and in that case I can go back by
railway,\xE2\x80\x99 she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon
made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
was nine feet high.

\xE2\x80\x98I wish I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t cried so much!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. \xE2\x80\x98I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!
However, everything is queer to-day.\xE2\x80\x99

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

\xE2\x80\x98Would it be of any use, now,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice, \xE2\x80\x98to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there\xE2\x80\x99s no harm in trying.\xE2\x80\x99 So she
began: \xE2\x80\x98O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!\xE2\x80\x99 (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brother\xE2\x80\x99s Latin Grammar, \xE2\x80\x98A mouse--of
a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!\xE2\x80\x99) The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.

\xE2\x80\x98Perhaps it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t understand English,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice; \xE2\x80\x98I daresay it\xE2\x80\x99s
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\xE2\x80\x99 (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: \xE2\x80\x98Ou est ma chatte?\xE2\x80\x99 which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
\xE2\x80\x98Oh, I beg your pardon!\xE2\x80\x99 cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
the poor animal\xE2\x80\x99s feelings. \xE2\x80\x98I quite forgot you didn\xE2\x80\x99t like cats.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Not like cats!\xE2\x80\x99 cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \xE2\x80\x98Would
YOU like cats if you were me?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Well, perhaps not,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice in a soothing tone: \xE2\x80\x98don\xE2\x80\x99t be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\xE2\x80\x99d
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
thing,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
pool, \xE2\x80\x98and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she\xE2\x80\x99s
such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!\xE2\x80\x99 cried
Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
felt certain it must be really offended. \xE2\x80\x98We won\xE2\x80\x99t talk about her any
more if you\xE2\x80\x99d rather not.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98We indeed!\xE2\x80\x99 cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. \xE2\x80\x98As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED
cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\xE2\x80\x99t let me hear the name again!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I won\xE2\x80\x99t indeed!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. \xE2\x80\x98Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?\xE2\x80\x99 The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \xE2\x80\x98There is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\xE2\x80\x99ll fetch things when
you throw them, and it\xE2\x80\x99ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things--I can\xE2\x80\x99t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,
you know, and he says it\xE2\x80\x99s so useful, it\xE2\x80\x99s worth a hundred pounds! He
says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!\xE2\x80\x99 cried Alice in a sorrowful
tone, \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m afraid I\xE2\x80\x99ve offended it again!\xE2\x80\x99 For the Mouse was swimming
away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
the pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, \xE2\x80\x98Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won\xE2\x80\x99t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\xE2\x80\x99t like them!\xE2\x80\x99 When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, \xE2\x80\x98Let us get to the shore, and then I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you my
history, and you\xE2\x80\x99ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\xE2\x80\x99

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale

They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \xE2\x80\x98I am older than
you, and must know better\xE2\x80\x99; and this Alice would not allow without
knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, \xE2\x80\x98Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\xE2\x80\x99LL soon make you
dry enough!\xE2\x80\x99 They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

\xE2\x80\x98Ahem!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mouse with an important air, \xE2\x80\x98are you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \xE2\x80\x9CWilliam
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria--\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Ugh!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Lory, with a shiver.

\xE2\x80\x98I beg your pardon!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \xE2\x80\x98Did
you speak?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Not I!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Lory hastily.

\xE2\x80\x98I thought you did,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mouse. \xE2\x80\x98--I proceed. \xE2\x80\x9CEdwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Found WHAT?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duck.

\xE2\x80\x98Found IT,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mouse replied rather crossly: \xE2\x80\x98of course you know what
\xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x9D means.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I know what \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x9D means well enough, when I find a thing,\xE2\x80\x99 said the
Duck: \xE2\x80\x98it\xE2\x80\x99s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?\xE2\x80\x99

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x9C--found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown. William\xE2\x80\x99s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his
Normans--\xE2\x80\x9D How are you getting on now, my dear?\xE2\x80\x99 it continued, turning
to Alice as it spoke.

\xE2\x80\x98As wet as ever,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice in a melancholy tone: \xE2\x80\x98it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t seem to
dry me at all.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98In that case,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \xE2\x80\x98I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Speak English!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Eaglet. \xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what\xE2\x80\x99s more, I don\xE2\x80\x99t believe you do either!\xE2\x80\x99 And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

\xE2\x80\x98What I was going to say,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dodo in an offended tone, \xE2\x80\x98was, that
the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98What IS a Caucus-race?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,
but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,
and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

\xE2\x80\x98Why,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dodo, \xE2\x80\x98the best way to explain it is to do it.\xE2\x80\x99 (And, as
you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, [\xE2\x80\x98the exact
shape doesn\xE2\x80\x99t matter,\xE2\x80\x99 it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no \xE2\x80\x98One, two, three, and
away,\xE2\x80\x99 but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
the Dodo suddenly called out \xE2\x80\x98The race is over!\xE2\x80\x99 and they all crowded
round it, panting, and asking, \xE2\x80\x98But who has won?\xE2\x80\x99

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures
of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,
\xE2\x80\x98EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98But who is to give the prizes?\xE2\x80\x99 quite a chorus of voices asked.

\xE2\x80\x98Why, SHE, of course,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;
and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
way, \xE2\x80\x98Prizes! Prizes!\xE2\x80\x99

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one
a-piece all round.

\xE2\x80\x98But she must have a prize herself, you know,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mouse.

\xE2\x80\x98Of course,\xE2\x80\x99 the Dodo replied very gravely. \xE2\x80\x98What else have you got in
your pocket?\xE2\x80\x99 he went on, turning to Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Only a thimble,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice sadly.

\xE2\x80\x98Hand it over here,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying \xE2\x80\x98We beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble\xE2\x80\x99; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

\xE2\x80\x98You promised to tell me your history, you know,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, \xE2\x80\x98and why
it is you hate--C and D,\xE2\x80\x99 she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

\xE2\x80\x98Mine is a long and a sad tale!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
sighing.

\xE2\x80\x98It IS a long tail, certainly,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, looking down with wonder at
the Mouse\xE2\x80\x99s tail; \xE2\x80\x98but why do you call it sad?\xE2\x80\x99 And she kept on puzzling
about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
something like this:--

         \xE2\x80\x98Fury said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     \xE2\x80\x9CLet us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         YOU.--Come,
           I\xE2\x80\x99ll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I\xE2\x80\x99ve
    nothing
    to do.\xE2\x80\x9D
      Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, \xE2\x80\x9CSuch
        a trial,
         dear Sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath.\xE2\x80\x9D
        \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll be
        judge, I\xE2\x80\x99ll
         be jury,\xE2\x80\x9D
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death.\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99


\xE2\x80\x98You are not attending!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mouse to Alice severely. \xE2\x80\x98What are you
thinking of?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice very humbly: \xE2\x80\x98you had got to the fifth
bend, I think?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I had NOT!\xE2\x80\x99 cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

\xE2\x80\x98A knot!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. \xE2\x80\x98Oh, do let me help to undo it!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I shall do nothing of the sort,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mouse, getting up and walking
away. \xE2\x80\x98You insult me by talking such nonsense!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I didn\xE2\x80\x99t mean it!\xE2\x80\x99 pleaded poor Alice. \xE2\x80\x98But you\xE2\x80\x99re so easily offended,
you know!\xE2\x80\x99

The Mouse only growled in reply.

\xE2\x80\x98Please come back and finish your story!\xE2\x80\x99 Alice called after it; and the
others all joined in chorus, \xE2\x80\x98Yes, please do!\xE2\x80\x99 but the Mouse only shook
its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

\xE2\x80\x98What a pity it wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t stay!\xE2\x80\x99 sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite
out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
daughter \xE2\x80\x98Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
YOUR temper!\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x98Hold your tongue, Ma!\xE2\x80\x99 said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. \xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice aloud, addressing
nobody in particular. \xE2\x80\x98She\xE2\x80\x99d soon fetch it back!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\xE2\x80\x99 said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
\xE2\x80\x98Dinah\xE2\x80\x99s our cat. And she\xE2\x80\x99s such a capital one for catching mice you
can\xE2\x80\x99t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
she\xE2\x80\x99ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\xE2\x80\x99

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, \xE2\x80\x98I really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn\xE2\x80\x99t suit my throat!\xE2\x80\x99 and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
its children, \xE2\x80\x98Come away, my dears! It\xE2\x80\x99s high time you were all in bed!\xE2\x80\x99
On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

\xE2\x80\x98I wish I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t mentioned Dinah!\xE2\x80\x99 she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. \xE2\x80\x98Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I\xE2\x80\x99m sure she\xE2\x80\x99s the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!\xE2\x80\x99 And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard
a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
back to finish his story.




CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill

It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself \xE2\x80\x98The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! She\xE2\x80\x99ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?\xE2\x80\x99 Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, \xE2\x80\x98Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing
out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
Quick, now!\xE2\x80\x99 And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once
in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it
had made.

\xE2\x80\x98He took me for his housemaid,\xE2\x80\x99 she said to herself as she ran. \xE2\x80\x98How
surprised he\xE2\x80\x99ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\xE2\x80\x99d better take him
his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.\xE2\x80\x99 As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name \xE2\x80\x98W. RABBIT\xE2\x80\x99 engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

\xE2\x80\x98How queer it seems,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice said to herself, \xE2\x80\x98to be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\xE2\x80\x99ll be sending me on messages next!\xE2\x80\x99 And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CComing in a minute,
nurse! But I\xE2\x80\x99ve got to see that the mouse doesn\xE2\x80\x99t get out.\xE2\x80\x9D Only I don\xE2\x80\x99t
think,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice went on, \xE2\x80\x98that they\xE2\x80\x99d let Dinah stop in the house if it
began ordering people about like that!\xE2\x80\x99

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time
with the words \xE2\x80\x98DRINK ME,\xE2\x80\x99 but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
to her lips. \xE2\x80\x98I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,\xE2\x80\x99 she said
to herself, \xE2\x80\x98whenever I eat or drink anything; so I\xE2\x80\x99ll just see what
this bottle does. I do hope it\xE2\x80\x99ll make me grow large again, for really
I\xE2\x80\x99m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\xE2\x80\x99

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself \xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s quite enough--I hope I shan\xE2\x80\x99t
grow any more--As it is, I can\xE2\x80\x99t get out at the door--I do wish I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t
drunk quite so much!\xE2\x80\x99

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \xE2\x80\x98Now I
can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?\xE2\x80\x99

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

\xE2\x80\x98It was much pleasanter at home,\xE2\x80\x99 thought poor Alice, \xE2\x80\x98when one wasn\xE2\x80\x99t
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and
yet--it\xE2\x80\x99s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that
kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I
grow up, I\xE2\x80\x99ll write one--but I\xE2\x80\x99m grown up now,\xE2\x80\x99 she added in a sorrowful
tone; \xE2\x80\x98at least there\xE2\x80\x99s no room to grow up any more HERE.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98But then,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice, \xE2\x80\x98shall I NEVER get any older than I am
now? That\xE2\x80\x99ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but
then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t like THAT!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, you foolish Alice!\xE2\x80\x99 she answered herself. \xE2\x80\x98How can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there\xE2\x80\x99s hardly room for YOU, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!\xE2\x80\x99

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making
quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard
a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

\xE2\x80\x98Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\xE2\x80\x99 said the voice. \xE2\x80\x98Fetch me my gloves this moment!\xE2\x80\x99
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Alice\xE2\x80\x99s elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \xE2\x80\x98Then I\xE2\x80\x99ll
go round and get in at the window.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98THAT you won\xE2\x80\x99t\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit\xE2\x80\x99s--\xE2\x80\x98Pat! Pat! Where are you?\xE2\x80\x99 And
then a voice she had never heard before, \xE2\x80\x98Sure then I\xE2\x80\x99m here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Digging for apples, indeed!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Rabbit angrily. \xE2\x80\x98Here! Come and
help me out of THIS!\xE2\x80\x99 (Sounds of more broken glass.)

\xE2\x80\x98Now tell me, Pat, what\xE2\x80\x99s that in the window?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Sure, it\xE2\x80\x99s an arm, yer honour!\xE2\x80\x99 (He pronounced it \xE2\x80\x98arrum.\xE2\x80\x99)

\xE2\x80\x98An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Sure, it does, yer honour: but it\xE2\x80\x99s an arm for all that.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Well, it\xE2\x80\x99s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\xE2\x80\x99

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, \xE2\x80\x98Sure, I don\xE2\x80\x99t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x98Do as I tell you, you coward!\xE2\x80\x99 and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \xE2\x80\x98What a number of
cucumber-frames there must be!\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice. \xE2\x80\x98I wonder what they\xE2\x80\x99ll do
next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I\xE2\x80\x99m
sure I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to stay in here any longer!\xE2\x80\x99

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices
all talking together: she made out the words: \xE2\x80\x98Where\xE2\x80\x99s the other
ladder?--Why, I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t to bring but one; Bill\xE2\x80\x99s got the other--Bill!
fetch it here, lad!--Here, put \xE2\x80\x98em up at this corner--No, tie \xE2\x80\x98em
together first--they don\xE2\x80\x99t reach half high enough yet--Oh! they\xE2\x80\x99ll
do well enough; don\xE2\x80\x99t be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this
rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it\xE2\x80\x99s coming
down! Heads below!\xE2\x80\x99 (a loud crash)--\xE2\x80\x98Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I
fancy--Who\xE2\x80\x99s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan\xE2\x80\x99t! YOU do it!--That I
won\xE2\x80\x99t, then!--Bill\xE2\x80\x99s to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you\xE2\x80\x99re to
go down the chimney!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Oh! So Bill\xE2\x80\x99s got to come down the chimney, has he?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice to
herself. \xE2\x80\x98Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be in
Bill\xE2\x80\x99s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I THINK I can kick a little!\xE2\x80\x99

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited
till she heard a little animal (she couldn\xE2\x80\x99t guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself \xE2\x80\x98This is Bill,\xE2\x80\x99 she gave one sharp kick, and waited to
see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \xE2\x80\x98There goes Bill!\xE2\x80\x99
then the Rabbit\xE2\x80\x99s voice along--\xE2\x80\x98Catch him, you by the hedge!\xE2\x80\x99 then
silence, and then another confusion of voices--\xE2\x80\x98Hold up his head--Brandy
now--Don\xE2\x80\x99t choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!\xE2\x80\x99

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, [\xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s Bill,\xE2\x80\x99 thought
Alice,) \xE2\x80\x98Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I\xE2\x80\x99m better now--but I\xE2\x80\x99m
a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98So you did, old fellow!\xE2\x80\x99 said the others.

\xE2\x80\x98We must burn the house down!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Rabbit\xE2\x80\x99s voice; and Alice called
out as loud as she could, \xE2\x80\x98If you do. I\xE2\x80\x99ll set Dinah at you!\xE2\x80\x99

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \xE2\x80\x98I
wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they\xE2\x80\x99d take the
roof off.\xE2\x80\x99 After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, \xE2\x80\x98A barrowful will do, to begin with.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98A barrowful of WHAT?\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ll put a stop to this,\xE2\x80\x99
she said to herself, and shouted out, \xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99d better not do that again!\xE2\x80\x99
which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. \xE2\x80\x98If I eat one of these cakes,\xE2\x80\x99 she thought, \xE2\x80\x98it\xE2\x80\x99s sure to make
SOME change in my size; and as it can\xE2\x80\x99t possibly make me larger, it must
make me smaller, I suppose.\xE2\x80\x99

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was
in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

\xE2\x80\x98The first thing I\xE2\x80\x99ve got to do,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice to herself, as she wandered
about in the wood, \xE2\x80\x98is to grow to my right size again; and the second
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be
the best plan.\xE2\x80\x99

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \xE2\x80\x98Poor little thing!\xE2\x80\x99
said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but
she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be
hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
till the puppy\xE2\x80\x99s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

\xE2\x80\x98And yet what a dear little puppy it was!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: \xE2\x80\x98I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I\xE2\x80\x99d
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\xE2\x80\x99d nearly forgotten that
I\xE2\x80\x99ve got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?\xE2\x80\x99

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long
hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.




CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar

The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
her in a languid, sleepy voice.

\xE2\x80\x98Who are YOU?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, \xE2\x80\x98I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know
who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98What do you mean by that?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar sternly. \xE2\x80\x98Explain
yourself!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I can\xE2\x80\x99t explain MYSELF, I\xE2\x80\x99m afraid, sir\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, \xE2\x80\x98because I\xE2\x80\x99m not
myself, you see.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t see,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xE2\x80\x99t put it more clearly,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice replied very politely,
\xE2\x80\x98for I can\xE2\x80\x99t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It isn\xE2\x80\x99t,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

\xE2\x80\x98Well, perhaps you haven\xE2\x80\x99t found it so yet,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice; \xE2\x80\x98but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you\xE2\x80\x99ll feel it a little
queer, won\xE2\x80\x99t you?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Not a bit,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

\xE2\x80\x98Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice; \xE2\x80\x98all I know
is, it would feel very queer to ME.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \xE2\x80\x98Who are YOU?\xE2\x80\x99

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\xE2\x80\x99s making such VERY
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \xE2\x80\x98I think,
you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Why?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

\xE2\x80\x98Come back!\xE2\x80\x99 the Caterpillar called after her. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve something important
to say!\xE2\x80\x99

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

\xE2\x80\x98Keep your temper,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

\xE2\x80\x98Is that all?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.

\xE2\x80\x98No,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some
minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \xE2\x80\x98So you think
you\xE2\x80\x99re changed, do you?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m afraid I am, sir,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice; \xE2\x80\x98I can\xE2\x80\x99t remember things as I
used--and I don\xE2\x80\x99t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Can\xE2\x80\x99t remember WHAT things?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

\xE2\x80\x98Well, I\xE2\x80\x99ve tried to say \xE2\x80\x9CHOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\xE2\x80\x9D but it all came
different!\xE2\x80\x99 Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

\xE2\x80\x98Repeat, \xE2\x80\x9CYOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:--

   \xE2\x80\x98You are old, Father William,\xE2\x80\x99 the young man said,
    \xE2\x80\x98And your hair has become very white;
   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?\xE2\x80\x99

   \xE2\x80\x98In my youth,\xE2\x80\x99 Father William replied to his son,
    \xE2\x80\x98I feared it might injure the brain;
   But, now that I\xE2\x80\x99m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.\xE2\x80\x99

   \xE2\x80\x98You are old,\xE2\x80\x99 said the youth, \xE2\x80\x98as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
    Pray, what is the reason of that?\xE2\x80\x99

   \xE2\x80\x98In my youth,\xE2\x80\x99 said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    \xE2\x80\x98I kept all my limbs very supple
   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
    Allow me to sell you a couple?\xE2\x80\x99

   \xE2\x80\x98You are old,\xE2\x80\x99 said the youth, \xE2\x80\x98and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
    Pray how did you manage to do it?\xE2\x80\x99

   \xE2\x80\x98In my youth,\xE2\x80\x99 said his father, \xE2\x80\x98I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.\xE2\x80\x99

   \xE2\x80\x98You are old,\xE2\x80\x99 said the youth, \xE2\x80\x98one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
    What made you so awfully clever?\xE2\x80\x99

   \xE2\x80\x98I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\xE2\x80\x99
    Said his father; \xE2\x80\x98don\xE2\x80\x99t give yourself airs!
   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I\xE2\x80\x99ll kick you down stairs!\xE2\x80\x99


\xE2\x80\x98That is not said right,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

\xE2\x80\x98Not QUITE right, I\xE2\x80\x99m afraid,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, timidly; \xE2\x80\x98some of the words
have got altered.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It is wrong from beginning to end,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar decidedly, and
there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

\xE2\x80\x98What size do you want to be?\xE2\x80\x99 it asked.

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, I\xE2\x80\x99m not particular as to size,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice hastily replied; \xE2\x80\x98only one
doesn\xE2\x80\x99t like changing so often, you know.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I DON\xE2\x80\x99T know,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

\xE2\x80\x98Are you content now?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar.

\xE2\x80\x98Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t mind,\xE2\x80\x99
said Alice: \xE2\x80\x98three inches is such a wretched height to be.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It is a very good height indeed!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

\xE2\x80\x98But I\xE2\x80\x99m not used to it!\xE2\x80\x99 pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And
she thought of herself, \xE2\x80\x98I wish the creatures wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be so easily
offended!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99ll get used to it in time,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In
a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
\xE2\x80\x98One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice to herself.

\xE2\x80\x98Of the mushroom,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she
stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
of the edge with each hand.

\xE2\x80\x98And now which is which?\xE2\x80\x99 she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.


  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

\xE2\x80\x98Come, my head\xE2\x80\x99s free at last!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

\xE2\x80\x98What CAN all that green stuff be?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice. \xE2\x80\x98And where HAVE my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\xE2\x80\x99t see you?\xE2\x80\x99
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she
tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her
neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had
just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going
to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops
of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made
her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and
was beating her violently with its wings.

\xE2\x80\x98Serpent!\xE2\x80\x99 screamed the Pigeon.

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m NOT a serpent!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice indignantly. \xE2\x80\x98Let me alone!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Serpent, I say again!\xE2\x80\x99 repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
and added with a kind of sob, \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve tried every way, and nothing seems
to suit them!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I haven\xE2\x80\x99t the least idea what you\xE2\x80\x99re talking about,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve tried the roots of trees, and I\xE2\x80\x99ve tried banks, and I\xE2\x80\x99ve tried
hedges,\xE2\x80\x99 the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \xE2\x80\x98but those
serpents! There\xE2\x80\x99s no pleasing them!\xE2\x80\x99

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

\xE2\x80\x98As if it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Pigeon;
\xE2\x80\x98but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven\xE2\x80\x99t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m very sorry you\xE2\x80\x99ve been annoyed,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

\xE2\x80\x98And just as I\xE2\x80\x99d taken the highest tree in the wood,\xE2\x80\x99 continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \xE2\x80\x98and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from
the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98But I\xE2\x80\x99m NOT a serpent, I tell you!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m a--I\xE2\x80\x99m a--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Well! WHAT are you?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Pigeon. \xE2\x80\x98I can see you\xE2\x80\x99re trying to
invent something!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I--I\xE2\x80\x99m a little girl,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

\xE2\x80\x98A likely story indeed!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE
with such a neck as that! No, no! You\xE2\x80\x99re a serpent; and there\xE2\x80\x99s no use
denying it. I suppose you\xE2\x80\x99ll be telling me next that you never tasted an
egg!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; \xE2\x80\x98but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t believe it,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Pigeon; \xE2\x80\x98but if they do, why then they\xE2\x80\x99re
a kind of serpent, that\xE2\x80\x99s all I can say.\xE2\x80\x99

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99re
looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me
whether you\xE2\x80\x99re a little girl or a serpent?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It matters a good deal to ME,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice hastily; \xE2\x80\x98but I\xE2\x80\x99m not looking
for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t want YOURS: I don\xE2\x80\x99t
like them raw.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Well, be off, then!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she
remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. \xE2\x80\x98Come, there\xE2\x80\x99s half my plan done
now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\xE2\x80\x99m never sure what I\xE2\x80\x99m going
to be, from one minute to another! However, I\xE2\x80\x99ve got back to my right
size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that
to be done, I wonder?\xE2\x80\x99 As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \xE2\x80\x98Whoever lives
there,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice, \xE2\x80\x98it\xE2\x80\x99ll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,
I should frighten them out of their wits!\xE2\x80\x99 So she began nibbling at the
righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she
had brought herself down to nine inches high.




CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper

For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened
by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all
over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,
and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, \xE2\x80\x98For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen
to play croquet.\xE2\x80\x99 The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,
only changing the order of the words a little, \xE2\x80\x98From the Queen. An
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\xE2\x80\x99

Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

\xE2\x80\x98There\xE2\x80\x99s no sort of use in knocking,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Footman, \xE2\x80\x98and that for
two reasons. First, because I\xE2\x80\x99m on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because they\xE2\x80\x99re making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you.\xE2\x80\x99 And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.

\xE2\x80\x98Please, then,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, \xE2\x80\x98how am I to get in?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98There might be some sense in your knocking,\xE2\x80\x99 the Footman went on
without attending to her, \xE2\x80\x98if we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.\xE2\x80\x99
He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this
Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \xE2\x80\x98But perhaps he can\xE2\x80\x99t help it,\xE2\x80\x99 she
said to herself; \xE2\x80\x98his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.
But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?\xE2\x80\x99 she
repeated, aloud.

\xE2\x80\x98I shall sit here,\xE2\x80\x99 the Footman remarked, \xE2\x80\x98till tomorrow--\xE2\x80\x99

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footman\xE2\x80\x99s head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

\xE2\x80\x98--or next day, maybe,\xE2\x80\x99 the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

\xE2\x80\x98How am I to get in?\xE2\x80\x99 asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

\xE2\x80\x98ARE you to get in at all?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Footman. \xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s the first
question, you know.\xE2\x80\x99

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s really
dreadful,\xE2\x80\x99 she muttered to herself, \xE2\x80\x98the way all the creatures argue.
It\xE2\x80\x99s enough to drive one crazy!\xE2\x80\x99

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. \xE2\x80\x98I shall sit here,\xE2\x80\x99 he said, \xE2\x80\x98on and off, for
days and days.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98But what am I to do?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Anything you like,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Footman, and began whistling.

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, there\xE2\x80\x99s no use in talking to him,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice desperately: \xE2\x80\x98he\xE2\x80\x99s
perfectly idiotic!\xE2\x80\x99 And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

\xE2\x80\x98There\xE2\x80\x99s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\xE2\x80\x99 Alice said to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess
sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment\xE2\x80\x99s pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

\xE2\x80\x98Please would you tell me,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \xE2\x80\x98why
your cat grins like that?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s a Cheshire cat,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess, \xE2\x80\x98and that\xE2\x80\x99s why. Pig!\xE2\x80\x99

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--

\xE2\x80\x98I didn\xE2\x80\x99t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\xE2\x80\x99t know
that cats COULD grin.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98They all can,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess; \xE2\x80\x98and most of \xE2\x80\x98em do.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t know of any that do,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

\xE2\x80\x98You don\xE2\x80\x99t know much,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess; \xE2\x80\x98and that\xE2\x80\x99s a fact.\xE2\x80\x99

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, PLEASE mind what you\xE2\x80\x99re doing!\xE2\x80\x99 cried Alice, jumping up and down in
an agony of terror. \xE2\x80\x98Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose\xE2\x80\x99; as an unusually
large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.

\xE2\x80\x98If everybody minded their own business,\xE2\x80\x99 the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, \xE2\x80\x98the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Which would NOT be an advantage,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, who felt very glad to get
an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \xE2\x80\x98Just think of
what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Talking of axes,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess, \xE2\x80\x98chop off her head!\xE2\x80\x99

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: \xE2\x80\x98Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is
it twelve? I--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, don\xE2\x80\x99t bother ME,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess; \xE2\x80\x98I never could abide figures!\xE2\x80\x99
And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of
every line:

   \xE2\x80\x98Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
   He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.\xE2\x80\x99

         CHORUS.

 (In which the cook and the baby joined):--

       \xE2\x80\x98Wow! wow! wow!\xE2\x80\x99

While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:--

   \xE2\x80\x98I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
   For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!\xE2\x80\x99

         CHORUS.

       \xE2\x80\x98Wow! wow! wow!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\xE2\x80\x99 the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \xE2\x80\x98I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,\xE2\x80\x99 and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw
a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, \xE2\x80\x98just
like a star-fish,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting
like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
it out into the open air. \xE2\x80\x98IF I don\xE2\x80\x99t take this child away with me,\xE2\x80\x99
thought Alice, \xE2\x80\x98they\xE2\x80\x99re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t it be
murder to leave it behind?\xE2\x80\x99 She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
\xE2\x80\x98Don\xE2\x80\x99t grunt,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice; \xE2\x80\x98that\xE2\x80\x99s not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself.\xE2\x80\x99

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to
see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its
eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
like the look of the thing at all. \xE2\x80\x98But perhaps it was only sobbing,\xE2\x80\x99
she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any
tears.

No, there were no tears. \xE2\x80\x98If you\xE2\x80\x99re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\xE2\x80\x99
said Alice, seriously, \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!\xE2\x80\x99 The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \xE2\x80\x98Now, what am I to do with
this creature when I get it home?\xE2\x80\x99 when it grunted again, so violently,
that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could
be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
it trot away quietly into the wood. \xE2\x80\x98If it had grown up,\xE2\x80\x99 she said
to herself, \xE2\x80\x98it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.\xE2\x80\x99 And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, \xE2\x80\x98if one only knew the right way to change them--\xE2\x80\x99 when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

\xE2\x80\x98Cheshire Puss,\xE2\x80\x99 she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
\xE2\x80\x98Come, it\xE2\x80\x99s pleased so far,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice, and she went on. \xE2\x80\x98Would you
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat.

\xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t much care where--\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Then it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t matter which way you go,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat.

\xE2\x80\x98--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice added as an explanation.

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, you\xE2\x80\x99re sure to do that,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat, \xE2\x80\x98if you only walk long
enough.\xE2\x80\x99

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
\xE2\x80\x98What sort of people live about here?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98In THAT direction,\xE2\x80\x99 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \xE2\x80\x98lives
a Hatter: and in THAT direction,\xE2\x80\x99 waving the other paw, \xE2\x80\x98lives a March
Hare. Visit either you like: they\xE2\x80\x99re both mad.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98But I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to go among mad people,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice remarked.

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, you can\xE2\x80\x99t help that,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat: \xE2\x80\x98we\xE2\x80\x99re all mad here. I\xE2\x80\x99m mad.
You\xE2\x80\x99re mad.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98How do you know I\xE2\x80\x99m mad?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98You must be,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat, \xE2\x80\x98or you wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have come here.\xE2\x80\x99

Alice didn\xE2\x80\x99t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \xE2\x80\x98And how
do you know that you\xE2\x80\x99re mad?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98To begin with,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat, \xE2\x80\x98a dog\xE2\x80\x99s not mad. You grant that?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I suppose so,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Well, then,\xE2\x80\x99 the Cat went on, \xE2\x80\x98you see, a dog growls when it\xE2\x80\x99s angry,
and wags its tail when it\xE2\x80\x99s pleased. Now I growl when I\xE2\x80\x99m pleased, and
wag my tail when I\xE2\x80\x99m angry. Therefore I\xE2\x80\x99m mad.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I call it purring, not growling,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Call it what you like,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat. \xE2\x80\x98Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I should like it very much,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, \xE2\x80\x98but I haven\xE2\x80\x99t been invited
yet.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99ll see me there,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

\xE2\x80\x98By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99d nearly
forgotten to ask.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It turned into a pig,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.

\xE2\x80\x98I thought it would,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve seen hatters before,\xE2\x80\x99 she
said to herself; \xE2\x80\x98the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won\xE2\x80\x99t be raving mad--at least not so mad as
it was in March.\xE2\x80\x99 As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

\xE2\x80\x98Did you say pig, or fig?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat.

\xE2\x80\x98I said pig,\xE2\x80\x99 replied Alice; \xE2\x80\x98and I wish you wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98All right,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

\xE2\x80\x98Well! I\xE2\x80\x99ve often seen a cat without a grin,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice; \xE2\x80\x98but a grin
without a cat! It\xE2\x80\x99s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\xE2\x80\x99

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house
of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
saying to herself \xE2\x80\x98Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost
wish I\xE2\x80\x99d gone to see the Hatter instead!\xE2\x80\x99




CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party

There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \xE2\x80\x98Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice; \xE2\x80\x98only, as it\xE2\x80\x99s asleep, I
suppose it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t mind.\xE2\x80\x99

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: \xE2\x80\x98No room! No room!\xE2\x80\x99 they cried out when they saw Alice
coming. \xE2\x80\x98There\xE2\x80\x99s PLENTY of room!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice indignantly, and she sat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

\xE2\x80\x98Have some wine,\xE2\x80\x99 the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
\xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t see any wine,\xE2\x80\x99 she remarked.

\xE2\x80\x98There isn\xE2\x80\x99t any,\xE2\x80\x99 said the March Hare.

\xE2\x80\x98Then it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t very civil of you to offer it,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice angrily.

\xE2\x80\x98It wasn\xE2\x80\x99t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\xE2\x80\x99 said
the March Hare.

\xE2\x80\x98I didn\xE2\x80\x99t know it was YOUR table,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice; \xE2\x80\x98it\xE2\x80\x99s laid for a great
many more than three.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Your hair wants cutting,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.

\xE2\x80\x98You should learn not to make personal remarks,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice said with some
severity; \xE2\x80\x98it\xE2\x80\x99s very rude.\xE2\x80\x99

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID
was, \xE2\x80\x98Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Come, we shall have some fun now!\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m glad they\xE2\x80\x99ve
begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,\xE2\x80\x99 she added aloud.

\xE2\x80\x98Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\xE2\x80\x99 said the
March Hare.

\xE2\x80\x98Exactly so,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Then you should say what you mean,\xE2\x80\x99 the March Hare went on.

\xE2\x80\x98I do,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice hastily replied; \xE2\x80\x98at least--at least I mean what I
say--that\xE2\x80\x99s the same thing, you know.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Not the same thing a bit!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter. \xE2\x80\x98You might just as well say
that \xE2\x80\x9CI see what I eat\xE2\x80\x9D is the same thing as \xE2\x80\x9CI eat what I see\xE2\x80\x9D!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You might just as well say,\xE2\x80\x99 added the March Hare, \xE2\x80\x98that \xE2\x80\x9CI like what I
get\xE2\x80\x9D is the same thing as \xE2\x80\x9CI get what I like\xE2\x80\x9D!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You might just as well say,\xE2\x80\x99 added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, \xE2\x80\x98that \xE2\x80\x9CI breathe when I sleep\xE2\x80\x9D is the same thing
as \xE2\x80\x9CI sleep when I breathe\xE2\x80\x9D!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It IS the same thing with you,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
which wasn\xE2\x80\x99t much.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. \xE2\x80\x98What day of the month
is it?\xE2\x80\x99 he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said \xE2\x80\x98The fourth.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Two days wrong!\xE2\x80\x99 sighed the Hatter. \xE2\x80\x98I told you butter wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t suit
the works!\xE2\x80\x99 he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

\xE2\x80\x98It was the BEST butter,\xE2\x80\x99 the March Hare meekly replied.

\xE2\x80\x98Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter grumbled:
\xE2\x80\x98you shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have put it in with the bread-knife.\xE2\x80\x99

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, \xE2\x80\x98It was the BEST butter,
you know.\xE2\x80\x99

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \xE2\x80\x98What a
funny watch!\xE2\x80\x99 she remarked. \xE2\x80\x98It tells the day of the month, and doesn\xE2\x80\x99t
tell what o\xE2\x80\x99clock it is!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Why should it?\xE2\x80\x99 muttered the Hatter. \xE2\x80\x98Does YOUR watch tell you what
year it is?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Of course not,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice replied very readily: \xE2\x80\x98but that\xE2\x80\x99s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Which is just the case with MINE,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\xE2\x80\x99s remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t quite
understand you,\xE2\x80\x99 she said, as politely as she could.

\xE2\x80\x98The Dormouse is asleep again,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, \xE2\x80\x98Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Have you guessed the riddle yet?\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.

\xE2\x80\x98No, I give it up,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice replied: \xE2\x80\x98what\xE2\x80\x99s the answer?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I haven\xE2\x80\x99t the slightest idea,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter.

\xE2\x80\x98Nor I,\xE2\x80\x99 said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. \xE2\x80\x98I think you might do something better with the
time,\xE2\x80\x99 she said, \xE2\x80\x98than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98If you knew Time as well as I do,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter, \xE2\x80\x98you wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t talk
about wasting IT. It\xE2\x80\x99s HIM.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t know what you mean,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Of course you don\xE2\x80\x99t!\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
\xE2\x80\x98I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Perhaps not,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice cautiously replied: \xE2\x80\x98but I know I have to beat time
when I learn music.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Ah! that accounts for it,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter. \xE2\x80\x98He won\xE2\x80\x99t stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\xE2\x80\x99d do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\xE2\x80\x99d only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!\xE2\x80\x99

[\xE2\x80\x98I only wish it was,\xE2\x80\x99 the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

\xE2\x80\x98That would be grand, certainly,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice thoughtfully: \xE2\x80\x98but then--I
shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be hungry for it, you know.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Not at first, perhaps,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter: \xE2\x80\x98but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Is that the way YOU manage?\xE2\x80\x99 Alice asked.

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. \xE2\x80\x98Not I!\xE2\x80\x99 he replied. \xE2\x80\x98We
quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--\xE2\x80\x99 (pointing
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \xE2\x80\x98--it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

     \xE2\x80\x9CTwinkle, twinkle, little bat!
     How I wonder what you\xE2\x80\x99re at!\xE2\x80\x9D

You know the song, perhaps?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve heard something like it,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98It goes on, you know,\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter continued, \xE2\x80\x98in this way:--

     \xE2\x80\x9CUp above the world you fly,
     Like a tea-tray in the sky.
         Twinkle, twinkle--\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x99

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep \xE2\x80\x98Twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--\xE2\x80\x99 and went on so long that they had to pinch
it to make it stop.

\xE2\x80\x98Well, I\xE2\x80\x99d hardly finished the first verse,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter, \xE2\x80\x98when the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, \xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s murdering the time! Off with his
head!\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98How dreadfully savage!\xE2\x80\x99 exclaimed Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98And ever since that,\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \xE2\x80\x98he won\xE2\x80\x99t
do a thing I ask! It\xE2\x80\x99s always six o\xE2\x80\x99clock now.\xE2\x80\x99

A bright idea came into Alice\xE2\x80\x99s head. \xE2\x80\x98Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?\xE2\x80\x99 she asked.

\xE2\x80\x98Yes, that\xE2\x80\x99s it,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter with a sigh: \xE2\x80\x98it\xE2\x80\x99s always tea-time,
and we\xE2\x80\x99ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Exactly so,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter: \xE2\x80\x98as the things get used up.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\xE2\x80\x99 Alice ventured
to ask.

\xE2\x80\x98Suppose we change the subject,\xE2\x80\x99 the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m afraid I don\xE2\x80\x99t know one,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

\xE2\x80\x98Then the Dormouse shall!\xE2\x80\x99 they both cried. \xE2\x80\x98Wake up, Dormouse!\xE2\x80\x99 And
they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \xE2\x80\x98I wasn\xE2\x80\x99t asleep,\xE2\x80\x99 he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: \xE2\x80\x98I heard every word you fellows were saying.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Tell us a story!\xE2\x80\x99 said the March Hare.

\xE2\x80\x98Yes, please do!\xE2\x80\x99 pleaded Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98And be quick about it,\xE2\x80\x99 added the Hatter, \xE2\x80\x98or you\xE2\x80\x99ll be asleep again
before it\xE2\x80\x99s done.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\xE2\x80\x99 the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; \xE2\x80\x98and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98What did they live on?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, who always took a great interest in
questions of eating and drinking.

\xE2\x80\x98They lived on treacle,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

\xE2\x80\x98They couldn\xE2\x80\x99t have done that, you know,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice gently remarked; \xE2\x80\x98they\xE2\x80\x99d
have been ill.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98So they were,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dormouse; \xE2\x80\x98VERY ill.\xE2\x80\x99

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \xE2\x80\x98But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Take some more tea,\xE2\x80\x99 the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve had nothing yet,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice replied in an offended tone, \xE2\x80\x98so I can\xE2\x80\x99t
take more.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You mean you can\xE2\x80\x99t take LESS,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter: \xE2\x80\x98it\xE2\x80\x99s very easy to take
MORE than nothing.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Nobody asked YOUR opinion,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Who\xE2\x80\x99s making personal remarks now?\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter asked triumphantly.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question. \xE2\x80\x98Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\xE2\x80\x99

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, \xE2\x80\x98It was a treacle-well.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98There\xE2\x80\x99s no such thing!\xE2\x80\x99 Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went \xE2\x80\x98Sh! sh!\xE2\x80\x99 and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, \xE2\x80\x98If you can\xE2\x80\x99t be civil, you\xE2\x80\x99d better finish the story for
yourself.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98No, please go on!\xE2\x80\x99 Alice said very humbly; \xE2\x80\x98I won\xE2\x80\x99t interrupt again. I
dare say there may be ONE.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98One, indeed!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. \xE2\x80\x98And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98What did they draw?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

\xE2\x80\x98Treacle,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

\xE2\x80\x98I want a clean cup,\xE2\x80\x99 interrupted the Hatter: \xE2\x80\x98let\xE2\x80\x99s all move one place
on.\xE2\x80\x99

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouse\xE2\x80\x99s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took
the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: \xE2\x80\x98But I don\xE2\x80\x99t understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You can draw water out of a water-well,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter; \xE2\x80\x98so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98But they were IN the well,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to
notice this last remark.

\xE2\x80\x98Of course they were\xE2\x80\x99, said the Dormouse; \xE2\x80\x98--well in.\xE2\x80\x99

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

\xE2\x80\x98They were learning to draw,\xE2\x80\x99 the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \xE2\x80\x98and they drew all manner of
things--everything that begins with an M--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Why with an M?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Why not?\xE2\x80\x99 said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with
a little shriek, and went on: \xE2\x80\x98--that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
things are \xE2\x80\x9Cmuch of a muchness\xE2\x80\x9D--did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Really, now you ask me,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, very much confused, \xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t
think--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Then you shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t talk,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.

\xE2\x80\x98At any rate I\xE2\x80\x99ll never go THERE again!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood. \xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all
my life!\xE2\x80\x99

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. \xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s very curious!\xE2\x80\x99 she thought. \xE2\x80\x98But
everything\xE2\x80\x99s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\xE2\x80\x99 And in
she went.

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table. \xE2\x80\x98Now, I\xE2\x80\x99ll manage better this time,\xE2\x80\x99 she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:
then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at
last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool
fountains.




CHAPTER VIII. The Queen\xE2\x80\x99s Croquet-Ground

A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went
nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of
them say, \xE2\x80\x98Look out now, Five! Don\xE2\x80\x99t go splashing paint over me like
that!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t help it,\xE2\x80\x99 said Five, in a sulky tone; \xE2\x80\x98Seven jogged my
elbow.\xE2\x80\x99

On which Seven looked up and said, \xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98YOU\xE2\x80\x99D better not talk!\xE2\x80\x99 said Five. \xE2\x80\x98I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98What for?\xE2\x80\x99 said the one who had spoken first.

\xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s none of YOUR business, Two!\xE2\x80\x99 said Seven.

\xE2\x80\x98Yes, it IS his business!\xE2\x80\x99 said Five, \xE2\x80\x98and I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell him--it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\xE2\x80\x99

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun \xE2\x80\x98Well, of all the unjust
things--\xE2\x80\x99 when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and
all of them bowed low.

\xE2\x80\x98Would you tell me,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, a little timidly, \xE2\x80\x98why you are painting
those roses?\xE2\x80\x99

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, \xE2\x80\x98Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
So you see, Miss, we\xE2\x80\x99re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\xE2\x80\x99 At this
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out \xE2\x80\x98The Queen! The Queen!\xE2\x80\x99 and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like
the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented
with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among
them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried
nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\xE2\x80\x99s
crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; \xE2\x80\x98and besides, what would be the use of
a procession,\xE2\x80\x99 thought she, \xE2\x80\x98if people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldn\xE2\x80\x99t see it?\xE2\x80\x99 So she stood still where she was,
and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely \xE2\x80\x98Who is this?\xE2\x80\x99 She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

\xE2\x80\x98Idiot!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
Alice, she went on, \xE2\x80\x98What\xE2\x80\x99s your name, child?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, \xE2\x80\x98Why, they\xE2\x80\x99re only a pack of cards, after
all. I needn\xE2\x80\x99t be afraid of them!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98And who are THESE?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who
were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their
faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the
pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or
courtiers, or three of her own children.

\xE2\x80\x98How should I know?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s no
business of MINE.\xE2\x80\x99

The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed \xE2\x80\x98Off with her head! Off--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Nonsense!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \xE2\x80\x98Consider, my
dear: she is only a child!\xE2\x80\x99

The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \xE2\x80\x98Turn them
over!\xE2\x80\x99

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

\xE2\x80\x98Get up!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.

\xE2\x80\x98Leave off that!\xE2\x80\x99 screamed the Queen. \xE2\x80\x98You make me giddy.\xE2\x80\x99 And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, \xE2\x80\x98What HAVE you been doing here?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98May it please your Majesty,\xE2\x80\x99 said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, \xE2\x80\x98we were trying--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I see!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
\xE2\x80\x98Off with their heads!\xE2\x80\x99 and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.

\xE2\x80\x98You shan\xE2\x80\x99t be beheaded!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.

\xE2\x80\x98Are their heads off?\xE2\x80\x99 shouted the Queen.

\xE2\x80\x98Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\xE2\x80\x99 the soldiers shouted
in reply.

\xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s right!\xE2\x80\x99 shouted the Queen. \xE2\x80\x98Can you play croquet?\xE2\x80\x99

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.

\xE2\x80\x98Yes!\xE2\x80\x99 shouted Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Come on, then!\xE2\x80\x99 roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

\xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s--it\xE2\x80\x99s a very fine day!\xE2\x80\x99 said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

\xE2\x80\x98Very,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice: \xE2\x80\x98--where\xE2\x80\x99s the Duchess?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Hush! Hush!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \xE2\x80\x98She\xE2\x80\x99s under
sentence of execution.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98What for?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Did you say \xE2\x80\x9CWhat a pity!\xE2\x80\x9D?\xE2\x80\x99 the Rabbit asked.

\xE2\x80\x98No, I didn\xE2\x80\x99t,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice: \xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t think it\xE2\x80\x99s at all a pity. I said
\xE2\x80\x9CWhat for?\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98She boxed the Queen\xE2\x80\x99s ears--\xE2\x80\x99 the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
scream of laughter. \xE2\x80\x98Oh, hush!\xE2\x80\x99 the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. \xE2\x80\x98The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Get to your places!\xE2\x80\x99 shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,
the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves
up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got
its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,
with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out
laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin
again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the
hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up
and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the
conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short
time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting \xE2\x80\x98Off with his head!\xE2\x80\x99 or \xE2\x80\x98Off with her head!\xE2\x80\x99 about once in a
minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
\xE2\x80\x98and then,\xE2\x80\x99 thought she, \xE2\x80\x98what would become of me? They\xE2\x80\x99re dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\xE2\x80\x99s any one
left alive!\xE2\x80\x99

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance
in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it
a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself
\xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98How are you getting on?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s no use
speaking to it,\xE2\x80\x99 she thought, \xE2\x80\x98till its ears have come, or at least one
of them.\xE2\x80\x99 In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was
enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

\xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t think they play at all fairly,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, \xE2\x80\x98and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\xE2\x80\x99t hear
oneself speak--and they don\xE2\x80\x99t seem to have any rules in particular;
at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you\xE2\x80\x99ve no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\xE2\x80\x99s the
arch I\xE2\x80\x99ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen\xE2\x80\x99s hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98How do you like the Queen?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Cat in a low voice.

\xE2\x80\x98Not at all,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice: \xE2\x80\x98she\xE2\x80\x99s so extremely--\xE2\x80\x99 Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
\xE2\x80\x98--likely to win, that it\xE2\x80\x99s hardly worth while finishing the game.\xE2\x80\x99

The Queen smiled and passed on.

\xE2\x80\x98Who ARE you talking to?\xE2\x80\x99 said the King, going up to Alice, and looking
at the Cat\xE2\x80\x99s head with great curiosity.

\xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice: \xE2\x80\x98allow me to
introduce it.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t like the look of it at all,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King: \xE2\x80\x98however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99d rather not,\xE2\x80\x99 the Cat remarked.

\xE2\x80\x98Don\xE2\x80\x99t be impertinent,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King, \xE2\x80\x98and don\xE2\x80\x99t look at me like that!\xE2\x80\x99
He got behind Alice as he spoke.

\xE2\x80\x98A cat may look at a king,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve read that in some book,
but I don\xE2\x80\x99t remember where.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Well, it must be removed,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \xE2\x80\x98My dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!\xE2\x80\x99

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.
\xE2\x80\x98Off with his head!\xE2\x80\x99 she said, without even looking round.

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ll fetch the executioner myself,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.

Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queen\xE2\x80\x99s voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \xE2\x80\x98but it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t
matter much,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice, \xE2\x80\x98as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.\xE2\x80\x99 So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a
large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The executioner\xE2\x80\x99s argument was, that you couldn\xE2\x80\x99t cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn\xE2\x80\x99t going to begin at HIS time of life.

The King\xE2\x80\x99s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren\xE2\x80\x99t to talk nonsense.

The Queen\xE2\x80\x99s argument was, that if something wasn\xE2\x80\x99t done about it in less
than no time she\xE2\x80\x99d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last
remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but \xE2\x80\x98It belongs to the Duchess:
you\xE2\x80\x99d better ask HER about it.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98She\xE2\x80\x99s in prison,\xE2\x80\x99 the Queen said to the executioner: \xE2\x80\x98fetch her here.\xE2\x80\x99
And the executioner went off like an arrow.

 The Cat\xE2\x80\x99s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.




CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle\xE2\x80\x99s Story

\xE2\x80\x98You can\xE2\x80\x99t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\xE2\x80\x99
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\xE2\x80\x99s, and
they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

\xE2\x80\x98When I\xE2\x80\x99M a Duchess,\xE2\x80\x99 she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
though), \xE2\x80\x98I won\xE2\x80\x99t have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very
well without--Maybe it\xE2\x80\x99s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,\xE2\x80\x99
she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of
rule, \xE2\x80\x98and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes
them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be so
stingy about it, you know--\xE2\x80\x99

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99re thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can\xE2\x80\x99t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Perhaps it hasn\xE2\x80\x99t one,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice ventured to remark.

\xE2\x80\x98Tut, tut, child!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess. \xE2\x80\x98Everything\xE2\x80\x99s got a moral, if only
you can find it.\xE2\x80\x99 And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\xE2\x80\x99s side as
she spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice\xE2\x80\x99s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

\xE2\x80\x98The game\xE2\x80\x99s going on rather better now,\xE2\x80\x99 she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99Tis so,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess: \xE2\x80\x98and the moral of that is--\xE2\x80\x9COh, \xE2\x80\x98tis love,
\xE2\x80\x98tis love, that makes the world go round!\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Somebody said,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice whispered, \xE2\x80\x98that it\xE2\x80\x99s done by everybody minding
their own business!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice\xE2\x80\x99s shoulder as she added, \xE2\x80\x98and the moral
of THAT is--\xE2\x80\x9CTake care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98How fond she is of finding morals in things!\xE2\x80\x99 Alice thought to herself.

\xE2\x80\x98I dare say you\xE2\x80\x99re wondering why I don\xE2\x80\x99t put my arm round your waist,\xE2\x80\x99
the Duchess said after a pause: \xE2\x80\x98the reason is, that I\xE2\x80\x99m doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98HE might bite,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to
have the experiment tried.

\xE2\x80\x98Very true,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess: \xE2\x80\x98flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is--\xE2\x80\x9CBirds of a feather flock together.\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Only mustard isn\xE2\x80\x99t a bird,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice remarked.

\xE2\x80\x98Right, as usual,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess: \xE2\x80\x98what a clear way you have of
putting things!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s a mineral, I THINK,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Of course it is,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; \xE2\x80\x98there\xE2\x80\x99s a large mustard-mine near here. And
the moral of that is--\xE2\x80\x9CThe more there is of mine, the less there is of
yours.\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, I know!\xE2\x80\x99 exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,
\xE2\x80\x98it\xE2\x80\x99s a vegetable. It doesn\xE2\x80\x99t look like one, but it is.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I quite agree with you,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess; \xE2\x80\x98and the moral of that
is--\xE2\x80\x9CBe what you would seem to be\xE2\x80\x9D--or if you\xE2\x80\x99d like it put more
simply--\xE2\x80\x9CNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I think I should understand that better,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice said very politely, \xE2\x80\x98if
I had it written down: but I can\xE2\x80\x99t quite follow it as you say it.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\xE2\x80\x99 the Duchess replied, in
a pleased tone.

\xE2\x80\x98Pray don\xE2\x80\x99t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\xE2\x80\x99 said
Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, don\xE2\x80\x99t talk about trouble!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess. \xE2\x80\x98I make you a present
of everything I\xE2\x80\x99ve said as yet.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98A cheap sort of present!\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m glad they don\xE2\x80\x99t give
birthday presents like that!\xE2\x80\x99 But she did not venture to say it out
loud.

\xE2\x80\x98Thinking again?\xE2\x80\x99 the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve a right to think,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

\xE2\x80\x98Just about as much right,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Duchess, \xE2\x80\x98as pigs have to fly; and
the m--\xE2\x80\x99

But here, to Alice\xE2\x80\x99s great surprise, the Duchess\xE2\x80\x99s voice died away, even
in the middle of her favourite word \xE2\x80\x98moral,\xE2\x80\x99 and the arm that was linked
into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen
in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.

\xE2\x80\x98A fine day, your Majesty!\xE2\x80\x99 the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

\xE2\x80\x98Now, I give you fair warning,\xE2\x80\x99 shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; \xE2\x80\x98either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!\xE2\x80\x99

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

\xE2\x80\x98Let\xE2\x80\x99s go on with the game,\xE2\x80\x99 the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was
too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\xE2\x80\x99s absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\xE2\x80\x99s delay would
cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
the other players, and shouting \xE2\x80\x98Off with his head!\xE2\x80\x99 or \xE2\x80\x98Off with her
head!\xE2\x80\x99 Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,
who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by
the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
under sentence of execution.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \xE2\x80\x98Have
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98No,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice. \xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen.

\xE2\x80\x98I never saw one, or heard of one,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Come on, then,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen, \xE2\x80\x98and he shall tell you his history,\xE2\x80\x99

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, \xE2\x80\x98You are all pardoned.\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x98Come, THAT\xE2\x80\x99S a good
thing!\xE2\x80\x99 she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.
(IF you don\xE2\x80\x99t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \xE2\x80\x98Up, lazy
thing!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen, \xE2\x80\x98and take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered\xE2\x80\x99; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with
the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on
the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. \xE2\x80\x98What fun!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98What IS the fun?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Why, SHE,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon. \xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Everybody says \xE2\x80\x9Ccome on!\xE2\x80\x9D here,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: \xE2\x80\x98I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\xE2\x80\x99

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. \xE2\x80\x98What is his sorrow?\xE2\x80\x99 she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s all his
fancy, that: he hasn\xE2\x80\x99t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\xE2\x80\x99

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

\xE2\x80\x98This here young lady,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon, \xE2\x80\x98she wants for to know your
history, she do.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell it her,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \xE2\x80\x98sit
down, both of you, and don\xE2\x80\x99t speak a word till I\xE2\x80\x99ve finished.\xE2\x80\x99

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, \xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t begin.\xE2\x80\x99 But
she waited patiently.

\xE2\x80\x98Once,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \xE2\x80\x98I was a real
Turtle.\xE2\x80\x99

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of \xE2\x80\x98Hjckrrh!\xE2\x80\x99 from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, \xE2\x80\x98Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,\xE2\x80\x99 but she could
not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

\xE2\x80\x98When we were little,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, \xE2\x80\x98we went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\xE2\x80\x99t one?\xE2\x80\x99 Alice asked.

\xE2\x80\x98We called him Tortoise because he taught us,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle
angrily: \xE2\x80\x98really you are very dull!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,\xE2\x80\x99
added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said
to the Mock Turtle, \xE2\x80\x98Drive on, old fellow! Don\xE2\x80\x99t be all day about it!\xE2\x80\x99
and he went on in these words:

\xE2\x80\x98Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\xE2\x80\x99t believe it--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I never said I didn\xE2\x80\x99t!\xE2\x80\x99 interrupted Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98You did,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle.

\xE2\x80\x98Hold your tongue!\xE2\x80\x99 added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.

\xE2\x80\x98We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99VE been to a day-school, too,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice; \xE2\x80\x98you needn\xE2\x80\x99t be so proud
as all that.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98With extras?\xE2\x80\x99 asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

\xE2\x80\x98Yes,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, \xE2\x80\x98we learned French and music.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98And washing?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle.

\xE2\x80\x98Certainly not!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice indignantly.

\xE2\x80\x98Ah! then yours wasn\xE2\x80\x99t a really good school,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle in
a tone of great relief. \xE2\x80\x98Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
\xE2\x80\x9CFrench, music, AND WASHING--extra.\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You couldn\xE2\x80\x99t have wanted it much,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice; \xE2\x80\x98living at the bottom of
the sea.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t afford to learn it.\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \xE2\x80\x98I
only took the regular course.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98What was that?\xE2\x80\x99 inquired Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle
replied; \xE2\x80\x98and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I never heard of \xE2\x80\x9CUglification,\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99 Alice ventured to say. \xE2\x80\x98What is it?\xE2\x80\x99

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \xE2\x80\x98What! Never heard of
uglifying!\xE2\x80\x99 it exclaimed. \xE2\x80\x98You know what to beautify is, I suppose?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Yes,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice doubtfully: \xE2\x80\x98it means--to--make--anything--prettier.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Well, then,\xE2\x80\x99 the Gryphon went on, \xE2\x80\x98if you don\xE2\x80\x99t know what to uglify is,
you ARE a simpleton.\xE2\x80\x99

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \xE2\x80\x98What else had you to learn?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Well, there was Mystery,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle replied, counting off
the subjects on his flappers, \xE2\x80\x98--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98What was THAT like?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Well, I can\xE2\x80\x99t show it you myself,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle said: \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Hadn\xE2\x80\x99t time,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon: \xE2\x80\x98I went to the Classics master, though.
He was an old crab, HE was.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I never went to him,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \xE2\x80\x98he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98So he did, so he did,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

\xE2\x80\x98And how many hours a day did you do lessons?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, in a hurry to
change the subject.

\xE2\x80\x98Ten hours the first day,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle: \xE2\x80\x98nine the next, and so
on.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98What a curious plan!\xE2\x80\x99 exclaimed Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s the reason they\xE2\x80\x99re called lessons,\xE2\x80\x99 the Gryphon remarked:
\xE2\x80\x98because they lessen from day to day.\xE2\x80\x99

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. \xE2\x80\x98Then the eleventh day must have been a
holiday?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Of course it was,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle.

\xE2\x80\x98And how did you manage on the twelfth?\xE2\x80\x99 Alice went on eagerly.

\xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s enough about lessons,\xE2\x80\x99 the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
tone: \xE2\x80\x98tell her something about the games now.\xE2\x80\x99




CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. \xE2\x80\x98Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\xE2\x80\x99
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:--

\xE2\x80\x98You may not have lived much under the sea--\xE2\x80\x99 [\xE2\x80\x98I haven\xE2\x80\x99t,\xE2\x80\x99 said
Alice)--\xE2\x80\x98and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--\xE2\x80\x99
(Alice began to say \xE2\x80\x98I once tasted--\xE2\x80\x99 but checked herself hastily, and
said \xE2\x80\x98No, never\xE2\x80\x99) \xE2\x80\x98--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98No, indeed,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice. \xE2\x80\x98What sort of a dance is it?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Why,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon, \xE2\x80\x98you first form into a line along the
sea-shore--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Two lines!\xE2\x80\x99 cried the Mock Turtle. \xE2\x80\x98Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you\xE2\x80\x99ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98THAT generally takes some time,\xE2\x80\x99 interrupted the Gryphon.

\xE2\x80\x98--you advance twice--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Each with a lobster as a partner!\xE2\x80\x99 cried the Gryphon.

\xE2\x80\x98Of course,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle said: \xE2\x80\x98advance twice, set to partners--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98--change lobsters, and retire in same order,\xE2\x80\x99 continued the Gryphon.

\xE2\x80\x98Then, you know,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle went on, \xE2\x80\x98you throw the--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98The lobsters!\xE2\x80\x99 shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

\xE2\x80\x98--as far out to sea as you can--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Swim after them!\xE2\x80\x99 screamed the Gryphon.

\xE2\x80\x98Turn a somersault in the sea!\xE2\x80\x99 cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.

\xE2\x80\x98Change lobsters again!\xE2\x80\x99 yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

\xE2\x80\x98Back to land again, and that\xE2\x80\x99s all the first figure,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
and quietly, and looked at Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98It must be a very pretty dance,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice timidly.

\xE2\x80\x98Would you like to see a little of it?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle.

\xE2\x80\x98Very much indeed,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Come, let\xE2\x80\x99s try the first figure!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
\xE2\x80\x98We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, YOU sing,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve forgotten the words.\xE2\x80\x99

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:--

 \xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x9CWill you walk a little faster?\xE2\x80\x9D said a whiting to a snail.
 \xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s a porpoise close behind us, and he\xE2\x80\x99s treading on my tail.

 See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
 They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?

 Will you, won\xE2\x80\x99t you, will you, won\xE2\x80\x99t you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, won\xE2\x80\x99t you, will you, won\xE2\x80\x99t you, won\xE2\x80\x99t you join the dance?

 \xE2\x80\x9CYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be
 When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\xE2\x80\x9D
  But the snail replied \xE2\x80\x9CToo far, too far!\xE2\x80\x9D and gave a look askance--
 Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.

 Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
 Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

 \xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x9CWhat matters it how far we go?\xE2\x80\x9D his scaly friend replied.
 \xE2\x80\x9CThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
 The further off from England the nearer is to France--
 Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.

 Will you, won\xE2\x80\x99t you, will you, won\xE2\x80\x99t you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, won\xE2\x80\x99t you, will you, won\xE2\x80\x99t you, won\xE2\x80\x99t you join the dance?\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Thank you, it\xE2\x80\x99s a very interesting dance to watch,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, feeling
very glad that it was over at last: \xE2\x80\x98and I do so like that curious song
about the whiting!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, as to the whiting,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle, \xE2\x80\x98they--you\xE2\x80\x99ve seen them,
of course?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Yes,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve often seen them at dinn--\xE2\x80\x99 she checked herself
hastily.

\xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t know where Dinn may be,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle, \xE2\x80\x98but if you\xE2\x80\x99ve
seen them so often, of course you know what they\xE2\x80\x99re like.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I believe so,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice replied thoughtfully. \xE2\x80\x98They have their tails in
their mouths--and they\xE2\x80\x99re all over crumbs.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99re wrong about the crumbs,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle: \xE2\x80\x98crumbs would all
wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the
reason is--\xE2\x80\x99 here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--\xE2\x80\x98Tell her
about the reason and all that,\xE2\x80\x99 he said to the Gryphon.

\xE2\x80\x98The reason is,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon, \xE2\x80\x98that they WOULD go with the lobsters
to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long
way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn\xE2\x80\x99t get
them out again. That\xE2\x80\x99s all.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Thank you,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, \xE2\x80\x98it\xE2\x80\x99s very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I can tell you more than that, if you like,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon. \xE2\x80\x98Do you
know why it\xE2\x80\x99s called a whiting?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I never thought about it,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice. \xE2\x80\x98Why?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.\xE2\x80\x99 the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. \xE2\x80\x98Does the boots and shoes!\xE2\x80\x99 she repeated
in a wondering tone.

\xE2\x80\x98Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon. \xE2\x80\x98I mean, what
makes them so shiny?\xE2\x80\x99

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. \xE2\x80\x98They\xE2\x80\x99re done with blacking, I believe.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Boots and shoes under the sea,\xE2\x80\x99 the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
\xE2\x80\x98are done with a whiting. Now you know.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98And what are they made of?\xE2\x80\x99 Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

\xE2\x80\x98Soles and eels, of course,\xE2\x80\x99 the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
\xE2\x80\x98any shrimp could have told you that.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98If I\xE2\x80\x99d been the whiting,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, whose thoughts were still running
on the song, \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99d have said to the porpoise, \xE2\x80\x9CKeep back, please: we
don\xE2\x80\x99t want YOU with us!\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98They were obliged to have him with them,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle said: \xE2\x80\x98no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t it really?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

\xE2\x80\x98Of course not,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle: \xE2\x80\x98why, if a fish came to ME, and
told me he was going a journey, I should say \xE2\x80\x9CWith what porpoise?\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Don\xE2\x80\x99t you mean \xE2\x80\x9Cpurpose\xE2\x80\x9D?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98I mean what I say,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
the Gryphon added \xE2\x80\x98Come, let\xE2\x80\x99s hear some of YOUR adventures.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\xE2\x80\x99 said
Alice a little timidly: \xE2\x80\x98but it\xE2\x80\x99s no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Explain all that,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle.

\xE2\x80\x98No, no! The adventures first,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
\xE2\x80\x98explanations take such a dreadful time.\xE2\x80\x99

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went
on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating \xE2\x80\x98YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\xE2\x80\x99 to the Caterpillar, and the
words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
and said \xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s very curious.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s all about as curious as it can be,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon.

\xE2\x80\x98It all came different!\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \xE2\x80\x98I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.\xE2\x80\x99 He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Stand up and repeat \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99 said the
Gryphon.

\xE2\x80\x98How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\xE2\x80\x99
thought Alice; \xE2\x80\x98I might as well be at school at once.\xE2\x80\x99 However, she
got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:--

  \xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
  \xE2\x80\x9CYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\xE2\x80\x9D
   As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\xE2\x80\x99

       [later editions continued as follows
  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]

\xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s different from what I used to say when I was a child,\xE2\x80\x99 said the
Gryphon.

\xE2\x80\x98Well, I never heard it before,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle; \xE2\x80\x98but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.\xE2\x80\x99

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.

\xE2\x80\x98I should like to have it explained,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Mock Turtle.

\xE2\x80\x98She can\xE2\x80\x99t explain it,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon hastily. \xE2\x80\x98Go on with the next
verse.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98But about his toes?\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle persisted. \xE2\x80\x98How COULD he turn them
out with his nose, you know?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s the first position in dancing.\xE2\x80\x99 Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

\xE2\x80\x98Go on with the next verse,\xE2\x80\x99 the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \xE2\x80\x98it
begins \xE2\x80\x9CI passed by his garden.\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--

  \xE2\x80\x98I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--\xE2\x80\x99

    [later editions continued as follows
  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
  And concluded the banquet--]

\xE2\x80\x98What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,\xE2\x80\x99 the Mock Turtle
interrupted, \xE2\x80\x98if you don\xE2\x80\x99t explain it as you go on? It\xE2\x80\x99s by far the most
confusing thing I ever heard!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Yes, I think you\xE2\x80\x99d better leave off,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

\xE2\x80\x98Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\xE2\x80\x99 the Gryphon went
on. \xE2\x80\x98Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\xE2\x80\x99 Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
\xE2\x80\x98Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \xE2\x80\x9CTurtle Soup,\xE2\x80\x9D will you, old
fellow?\xE2\x80\x99

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:--

   \xE2\x80\x98Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
   Waiting in a hot tureen!
   Who for such dainties would not stoop?
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

   \xE2\x80\x98Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
   Game, or any other dish?
   Who would not give all else for two
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Chorus again!\xE2\x80\x99 cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of \xE2\x80\x98The trial\xE2\x80\x99s beginning!\xE2\x80\x99 was heard in the
distance.

\xE2\x80\x98Come on!\xE2\x80\x99 cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

\xE2\x80\x98What trial is it?\xE2\x80\x99 Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered \xE2\x80\x98Come on!\xE2\x80\x99 and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--

   \xE2\x80\x98Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\xE2\x80\x99




CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?

The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court
was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--\xE2\x80\x98I wish they\xE2\x80\x99d get the
trial done,\xE2\x80\x99 she thought, \xE2\x80\x98and hand round the refreshments!\xE2\x80\x99 But there
seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. \xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s the judge,\xE2\x80\x99 she said to
herself, \xE2\x80\x98because of his great wig.\xE2\x80\x99

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did
not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

\xE2\x80\x98And that\xE2\x80\x99s the jury-box,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice, \xE2\x80\x98and those twelve creatures,\xE2\x80\x99
(she was obliged to say \xE2\x80\x98creatures,\xE2\x80\x99 you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) \xE2\x80\x98I suppose they are the jurors.\xE2\x80\x99 She said
this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
age knew the meaning of it at all. However, \xE2\x80\x98jury-men\xE2\x80\x99 would have done
just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \xE2\x80\x98What are they
doing?\xE2\x80\x99 Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \xE2\x80\x98They can\xE2\x80\x99t have anything to put
down yet, before the trial\xE2\x80\x99s begun.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98They\xE2\x80\x99re putting down their names,\xE2\x80\x99 the Gryphon whispered in reply, \xE2\x80\x98for
fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Stupid things!\xE2\x80\x99 Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \xE2\x80\x98Silence in the court!\xE2\x80\x99 and the
King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who
was talking.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down \xE2\x80\x98stupid things!\xE2\x80\x99 on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn\xE2\x80\x99t know how to spell
\xE2\x80\x98stupid,\xE2\x80\x99 and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \xE2\x80\x98A nice
muddle their slates\xE2\x80\x99ll be in before the trial\xE2\x80\x99s over!\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

\xE2\x80\x98Herald, read the accusation!\xE2\x80\x99 said the King.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--

   \xE2\x80\x98The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
      All on a summer day:
    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
      And took them quite away!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Consider your verdict,\xE2\x80\x99 the King said to the jury.

\xE2\x80\x98Not yet, not yet!\xE2\x80\x99 the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \xE2\x80\x98There\xE2\x80\x99s a great
deal to come before that!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Call the first witness,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \xE2\x80\x98First witness!\xE2\x80\x99

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \xE2\x80\x98I beg pardon, your
Majesty,\xE2\x80\x99 he began, \xE2\x80\x98for bringing these in: but I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You ought to have finished,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King. \xE2\x80\x98When did you begin?\xE2\x80\x99

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. \xE2\x80\x98Fourteenth of March, I think it
was,\xE2\x80\x99 he said.

\xE2\x80\x98Fifteenth,\xE2\x80\x99 said the March Hare.

\xE2\x80\x98Sixteenth,\xE2\x80\x99 added the Dormouse.

\xE2\x80\x98Write that down,\xE2\x80\x99 the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

\xE2\x80\x98Take off your hat,\xE2\x80\x99 the King said to the Hatter.

\xE2\x80\x98It isn\xE2\x80\x99t mine,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter.

\xE2\x80\x98Stolen!\xE2\x80\x99 the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a
memorandum of the fact.

\xE2\x80\x98I keep them to sell,\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter added as an explanation; \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve none of
my own. I\xE2\x80\x99m a hatter.\xE2\x80\x99

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

\xE2\x80\x98Give your evidence,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King; \xE2\x80\x98and don\xE2\x80\x99t be nervous, or I\xE2\x80\x99ll have
you executed on the spot.\xE2\x80\x99

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her.

\xE2\x80\x98I wish you wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t squeeze so.\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. \xE2\x80\x98I can hardly breathe.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I can\xE2\x80\x99t help it,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice very meekly: \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m growing.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99ve no right to grow here,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dormouse.

\xE2\x80\x98Don\xE2\x80\x99t talk nonsense,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice more boldly: \xE2\x80\x98you know you\xE2\x80\x99re growing
too.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Dormouse: \xE2\x80\x98not in that
ridiculous fashion.\xE2\x80\x99 And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
other side of the court.

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, \xE2\x80\x98Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\xE2\x80\x99 on
which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.

\xE2\x80\x98Give your evidence,\xE2\x80\x99 the King repeated angrily, \xE2\x80\x98or I\xE2\x80\x99ll have you
executed, whether you\xE2\x80\x99re nervous or not.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m a poor man, your Majesty,\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
\xE2\x80\x98--and I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98The twinkling of the what?\xE2\x80\x99 said the King.

\xE2\x80\x98It began with the tea,\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter replied.

\xE2\x80\x98Of course twinkling begins with a T!\xE2\x80\x99 said the King sharply. \xE2\x80\x98Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m a poor man,\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter went on, \xE2\x80\x98and most things twinkled after
that--only the March Hare said--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I didn\xE2\x80\x99t!\xE2\x80\x99 the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

\xE2\x80\x98You did!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter.

\xE2\x80\x98I deny it!\xE2\x80\x99 said the March Hare.

\xE2\x80\x98He denies it,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King: \xE2\x80\x98leave out that part.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--\xE2\x80\x99 the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

\xE2\x80\x98After that,\xE2\x80\x99 continued the Hatter, \xE2\x80\x98I cut some more bread-and-butter--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98But what did the Dormouse say?\xE2\x80\x99 one of the jury asked.

\xE2\x80\x98That I can\xE2\x80\x99t remember,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter.

\xE2\x80\x98You MUST remember,\xE2\x80\x99 remarked the King, \xE2\x80\x98or I\xE2\x80\x99ll have you executed.\xE2\x80\x99

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m a poor man, your Majesty,\xE2\x80\x99 he began.

\xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99re a very poor speaker,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m glad I\xE2\x80\x99ve seen that done,\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice. \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ve so often read
in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \xE2\x80\x9CThere was some attempts
at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,\xE2\x80\x9D and I never understood what it meant till now.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98If that\xE2\x80\x99s all you know about it, you may stand down,\xE2\x80\x99 continued the
King.

\xE2\x80\x98I can\xE2\x80\x99t go no lower,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter: \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m on the floor, as it is.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Then you may SIT down,\xE2\x80\x99 the King replied.

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

\xE2\x80\x98Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!\xE2\x80\x99 thought Alice. \xE2\x80\x98Now we shall get
on better.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99d rather finish my tea,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

\xE2\x80\x98You may go,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

\xE2\x80\x98--and just take his head off outside,\xE2\x80\x99 the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

\xE2\x80\x98Call the next witness!\xE2\x80\x99 said the King.

The next witness was the Duchess\xE2\x80\x99s cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

\xE2\x80\x98Give your evidence,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King.

\xE2\x80\x98Shan\xE2\x80\x99t,\xE2\x80\x99 said the cook.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
\xE2\x80\x98Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Well, if I must, I must,\xE2\x80\x99 the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \xE2\x80\x98What are tarts made of?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Pepper, mostly,\xE2\x80\x99 said the cook.

\xE2\x80\x98Treacle,\xE2\x80\x99 said a sleepy voice behind her.

\xE2\x80\x98Collar that Dormouse,\xE2\x80\x99 the Queen shrieked out. \xE2\x80\x98Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!\xE2\x80\x99

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

\xE2\x80\x98Never mind!\xE2\x80\x99 said the King, with an air of great relief. \xE2\x80\x98Call the next
witness.\xE2\x80\x99 And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \xE2\x80\x98Really, my dear,
YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
ache!\xE2\x80\x99

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
curious to see what the next witness would be like, \xE2\x80\x98--for they haven\xE2\x80\x99t
got much evidence YET,\xE2\x80\x99 she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when
the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the

CHAPTER XII. Alice\xE2\x80\x99s Evidence


\xE2\x80\x98Here!\xE2\x80\x99 cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish
she had accidentally upset the week before.

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, I BEG your pardon!\xE2\x80\x99 she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
they would die.

\xE2\x80\x98The trial cannot proceed,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King in a very grave voice, \xE2\x80\x98until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,\xE2\x80\x99 he repeated with
great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got
it out again, and put it right; \xE2\x80\x98not that it signifies much,\xE2\x80\x99 she said
to herself; \xE2\x80\x98I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial
one way up as the other.\xE2\x80\x99

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

\xE2\x80\x98What do you know about this business?\xE2\x80\x99 the King said to Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Nothing,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Nothing WHATEVER?\xE2\x80\x99 persisted the King.

\xE2\x80\x98Nothing whatever,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s very important,\xE2\x80\x99 the King said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
interrupted: \xE2\x80\x98UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,\xE2\x80\x99 he said in a
very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.

\xE2\x80\x98UNimportant, of course, I meant,\xE2\x80\x99 the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

\xE2\x80\x98important--unimportant--unimportant--important--\xE2\x80\x99 as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down \xE2\x80\x98important,\xE2\x80\x99 and some \xE2\x80\x98unimportant.\xE2\x80\x99
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
\xE2\x80\x98but it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t matter a bit,\xE2\x80\x99 she thought to herself.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out \xE2\x80\x98Silence!\xE2\x80\x99 and read out from his book, \xE2\x80\x98Rule
Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.\xE2\x80\x99

Everybody looked at Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99M not a mile high,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98You are,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King.

\xE2\x80\x98Nearly two miles high,\xE2\x80\x99 added the Queen.

\xE2\x80\x98Well, I shan\xE2\x80\x99t go, at any rate,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice: \xE2\x80\x98besides, that\xE2\x80\x99s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s the oldest rule in the book,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King.

\xE2\x80\x98Then it ought to be Number One,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \xE2\x80\x98Consider your
verdict,\xE2\x80\x99 he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

\xE2\x80\x98There\xE2\x80\x99s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\xE2\x80\x99 said the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \xE2\x80\x98this paper has just been picked
up.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98What\xE2\x80\x99s in it?\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen.

\xE2\x80\x98I haven\xE2\x80\x99t opened it yet,\xE2\x80\x99 said the White Rabbit, \xE2\x80\x98but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98It must have been that,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King, \xE2\x80\x98unless it was written to
nobody, which isn\xE2\x80\x99t usual, you know.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Who is it directed to?\xE2\x80\x99 said one of the jurymen.

\xE2\x80\x98It isn\xE2\x80\x99t directed at all,\xE2\x80\x99 said the White Rabbit; \xE2\x80\x98in fact, there\xE2\x80\x99s
nothing written on the OUTSIDE.\xE2\x80\x99 He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and
added \xE2\x80\x98It isn\xE2\x80\x99t a letter, after all: it\xE2\x80\x99s a set of verses.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Are they in the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s handwriting?\xE2\x80\x99 asked another of the jurymen.

\xE2\x80\x98No, they\xE2\x80\x99re not,\xE2\x80\x99 said the White Rabbit, \xE2\x80\x98and that\xE2\x80\x99s the queerest thing
about it.\xE2\x80\x99 (The jury all looked puzzled.)

\xE2\x80\x98He must have imitated somebody else\xE2\x80\x99s hand,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)

\xE2\x80\x98Please your Majesty,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Knave, \xE2\x80\x98I didn\xE2\x80\x99t write it, and they
can\xE2\x80\x99t prove I did: there\xE2\x80\x99s no name signed at the end.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98If you didn\xE2\x80\x99t sign it,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King, \xE2\x80\x98that only makes the matter
worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you\xE2\x80\x99d have signed your
name like an honest man.\xE2\x80\x99

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.

\xE2\x80\x98That PROVES his guilt,\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen.

\xE2\x80\x98It proves nothing of the sort!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice. \xE2\x80\x98Why, you don\xE2\x80\x99t even know
what they\xE2\x80\x99re about!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Read them,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \xE2\x80\x98Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty?\xE2\x80\x99 he asked.

\xE2\x80\x98Begin at the beginning,\xE2\x80\x99 the King said gravely, \xE2\x80\x98and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.\xE2\x80\x99

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--

   \xE2\x80\x98They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
   She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

   He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
   If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

   I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
   They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

   If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
   He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

   My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
   An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

   Don\xE2\x80\x99t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
   A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98That\xE2\x80\x99s the most important piece of evidence we\xE2\x80\x99ve heard yet,\xE2\x80\x99 said the
King, rubbing his hands; \xE2\x80\x98so now let the jury--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98If any one of them can explain it,\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, (she had grown so large
in the last few minutes that she wasn\xE2\x80\x99t a bit afraid of interrupting
him,) \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99ll give him sixpence. _I_ don\xE2\x80\x99t believe there\xE2\x80\x99s an atom of
meaning in it.\xE2\x80\x99

The jury all wrote down on their slates, \xE2\x80\x98SHE doesn\xE2\x80\x99t believe there\xE2\x80\x99s an
atom of meaning in it,\xE2\x80\x99 but none of them attempted to explain the paper.

\xE2\x80\x98If there\xE2\x80\x99s no meaning in it,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King, \xE2\x80\x98that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn\xE2\x80\x99t try to find any. And yet I don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x99
he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
with one eye; \xE2\x80\x98I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \xE2\x80\x9C--SAID
I COULD NOT SWIM--\xE2\x80\x9D you can\xE2\x80\x99t swim, can you?\xE2\x80\x99 he added, turning to the
Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. \xE2\x80\x98Do I look like it?\xE2\x80\x99 he said. (Which he
certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)

\xE2\x80\x98All right, so far,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King, and he went on muttering over
the verses to himself: \xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x9CWE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\xE2\x80\x9D that\xE2\x80\x99s the jury, of
course--\xE2\x80\x9CI GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\xE2\x80\x9D why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know--\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98But, it goes on \xE2\x80\x9CTHEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Why, there they are!\xE2\x80\x99 said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
on the table. \xE2\x80\x98Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--\xE2\x80\x9CBEFORE SHE
HAD THIS FIT--\xE2\x80\x9D you never had fits, my dear, I think?\xE2\x80\x99 he said to the
Queen.

\xE2\x80\x98Never!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
it lasted.)

\xE2\x80\x98Then the words don\xE2\x80\x99t FIT you,\xE2\x80\x99 said the King, looking round the court
with a smile. There was a dead silence.

\xE2\x80\x98It\xE2\x80\x99s a pun!\xE2\x80\x99 the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,
\xE2\x80\x98Let the jury consider their verdict,\xE2\x80\x99 the King said, for about the
twentieth time that day.

\xE2\x80\x98No, no!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen. \xE2\x80\x98Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Stuff and nonsense!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice loudly. \xE2\x80\x98The idea of having the
sentence first!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Hold your tongue!\xE2\x80\x99 said the Queen, turning purple.

\xE2\x80\x98I won\xE2\x80\x99t!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice.

\xE2\x80\x98Off with her head!\xE2\x80\x99 the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
moved.

\xE2\x80\x98Who cares for you?\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this
time.) \xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99re nothing but a pack of cards!\xE2\x80\x99

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

\xE2\x80\x98Wake up, Alice dear!\xE2\x80\x99 said her sister; \xE2\x80\x98Why, what a long sleep you\xE2\x80\x99ve
had!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x98Oh, I\xE2\x80\x99ve had such a curious dream!\xE2\x80\x99 said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \xE2\x80\x98It WAS a curious dream,
dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\xE2\x80\x99s getting late.\xE2\x80\x99 So
Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.

But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
this was her dream:--

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
of her little sister\xE2\x80\x99s dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess\xE2\x80\x99s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard\xE2\x80\x99s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\xE2\x80\x99s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing
of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle\xE2\x80\x99s
heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

Letter 1


St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--

TO Mrs. Saville, England

You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
forebodings.  I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
of my undertaking.

I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of
Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
braces my nerves and fills me with delight.  Do you understand this
feeling?  This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
and vivid.  I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
region of beauty and delight.  There, Margaret, the sun is forever
visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
perpetual splendour.  There--for with your leave, my sister, I will put
some trust in preceding navigators--there snow and frost are banished;
and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
globe.  Its productions and features may be without example, as the
phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
solitudes.  What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?  I
may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may
regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this
voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever.  I
shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world
never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by
the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to
conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you
cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all
mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole
to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at
all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.

These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my
letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me
to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as
a steady purpose--a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual
eye.  This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I
have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have
been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean
through the seas which surround the pole.  You may remember that a
history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
whole of our good Uncle Thomas' library.  My education was neglected,
yet I was passionately fond of reading.  These volumes were my study
day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which
I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction
had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.

These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets
whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.  I also
became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;
I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the
names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.  You are well
acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.
But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my
thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.

Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.  I
can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this
great enterprise.  I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.  I
accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;
I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often
worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my
nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those
branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive
the greatest practical advantage.  Twice I actually hired myself as an
under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I
must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second
dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest
earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.  And now, dear
Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?  My life
might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to
every enticement that wealth placed in my path.  Oh, that some
encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative!  My courage and my
resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often
depressed.  I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the
emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude:  I am required not
only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own,
when theirs are failing.

This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.  They fly
quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in
my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.  The
cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs--a dress which I have
already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the
deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise
prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.  I have no
ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and
Archangel. I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three
weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be
done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many
sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the
whale-fishing.  I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and
when shall I return?  Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?
If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you
and I may meet.  If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.
Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on
you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for
all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,
  R. Walton



Letter 2


Archangel, 28th March, 17--

To Mrs. Saville, England

How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!
Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.  I have hired a
vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have
already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly
possessed of dauntless courage.

But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and
the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I
have no friend, Margaret:  when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of
success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by
disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I
shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor
medium for the communication of feeling.  I desire the company of a man
who could sympathize with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may
deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a
friend.  I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a
cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my
own, to approve or amend my plans.  How would such a friend repair the
faults of your poor brother!  I am too ardent in execution and too
impatient of difficulties.  But it is a still greater evil to me that I
am self-educated:  for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild
on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas' books of voyages. At
that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own
country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive
its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the
necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my
native country.  Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more
illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.  It is true that I have
thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent,
but they want (as the painters call it) KEEPING; and I greatly need a
friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and
affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.  Well, these
are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide
ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.  Yet
some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in
these rugged bosoms.  My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of
wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or
rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in
his profession.  He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and
professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the
noblest endowments of humanity.  I first became acquainted with him on
board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I
easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.  The master is a person
of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his
gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.  This circumstance,
added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very
desirous to engage him.  A youth passed in solitude, my best years
spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the
groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste
to the usual brutality exercised on board ship:  I have never believed
it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his
kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his
crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his
services.  I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a
lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.  This, briefly, is his
story.  Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate
fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the
father of the girl consented to the match.  He saw his mistress once
before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing
herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same
time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father
would never consent to the union.  My generous friend reassured the
suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly
abandoned his pursuit.  He had already bought a farm with his money, on
which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he
bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his
prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young
woman's father to consent to her marriage with her lover.  But the old
man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend,
who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor
returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according
to her inclinations.  "What a noble fellow!" you will exclaim.  He is
so; but then he is wholly uneducated:  he is as silent as a Turk, and a
kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his
conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy
which otherwise he would command.

Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can
conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am
wavering in my resolutions.  Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage
is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.  The
winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it
is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail
sooner than I expected.  I shall do nothing rashly:  you know me
sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the
safety of others is committed to my care.

I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my
undertaking.  It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of
the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which
I am preparing to depart.  I am going to unexplored regions, to "the
land of mist and snow," but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not
be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and
woeful as the "Ancient Mariner."  You will smile at my allusion, but I
will disclose a secret.  I have often attributed my attachment to, my
passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that
production of the most imaginative of modern poets.  There is something
at work in my soul which I do not understand.  I am practically
industrious--painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and
labour--but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief
in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out
of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited
regions I am about to explore. But to return to dearer considerations.
Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and
returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?  I dare not
expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the
picture.  Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity:
I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to
support my spirits.  I love you very tenderly.  Remember me with
affection, should you never hear from me again.

Your affectionate brother,
  Robert Walton



Letter 3



July 7th, 17--

To Mrs. Saville, England

My dear Sister,

I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe--and well advanced
on my voyage.  This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on
its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not
see my native land, perhaps, for many years.  I am, however, in good
spirits:  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the
floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers
of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We
have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of
summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,
which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire
to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not
expected.

No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a
letter.  One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are
accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and
I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.

Adieu, my dear Margaret.  Be assured that for my own sake, as well as
yours, I will not rashly encounter danger.  I will be cool,
persevering, and prudent.

But success SHALL crown my endeavours.  Wherefore not?  Thus far I have
gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars
themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.  Why not
still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?  What can stop the
determined heart and resolved will of man?

My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.  But I must
finish.  Heaven bless my beloved sister!

R.W.



Letter 4



August 5th, 17--

To Mrs. Saville, England

So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear
recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before
these papers can come into your possession.

Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which
she floated.  Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we
were compassed round by a very thick fog.  We accordingly lay to,
hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.

About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out
in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to
have no end.  Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to
grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own
situation.  We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by
dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a
being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,
sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.  We watched the rapid progress
of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the
distant inequalities of the ice.  This appearance excited our
unqualified wonder.  We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from
any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in
reality, so distant as we had supposed.  Shut in, however, by ice, it
was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the
greatest attention.  About two hours after this occurrence we heard the
ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.  We,
however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark
those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the
ice.  I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.

In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and
found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
talking to someone in the sea.  It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we
had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large
fragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
some undiscovered island, but a European.  When I appeared on deck the
master said, "Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
on the open sea."

On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a
foreign accent.  "Before I come on board your vessel," said he, "will
you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?"

You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed
to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have
supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not
have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.  I
replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the
northern pole.

Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
Good God!  Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for
his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.  His limbs were
nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and
suffering.  I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.  We attempted
to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh
air he fainted.  We accordingly brought him back to the deck and
restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to
swallow a small quantity.  As soon as he showed signs of life we
wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the
kitchen stove.  By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,
which restored him wonderfully.

Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often
feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.  When he
had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and
attended on him as much as my duty would permit.  I never saw a more
interesting creature:  his eyes have generally an expression of
wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone
performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most
trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with
a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.  But he
is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his
teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.

When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off
the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not
allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body
and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice
in so strange a vehicle.

His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and
he replied, "To seek one who fled from me."

"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?"

"Yes."

"Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we
saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice."

This aroused the stranger's attention, and he asked a multitude of
questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had
pursued.  Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, "I have,
doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good
people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries."

"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to
trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine."

"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have
benevolently restored me to life."

Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the
ice had destroyed the other sledge.  I replied that I could not answer
with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near
midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety
before that time; but of this I could not judge.  From this time a new
spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.  He
manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the
sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in
the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the
atmosphere.  I have promised that someone should watch for him and give
him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.

Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the
present day.  The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very
silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all
interested in him, although they have had very little communication
with him.  For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his
constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.  He must
have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
so attractive and amiable.  I said in one of my letters, my dear
Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have
found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should
have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.

I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,
should I have any fresh incidents to record.


August 13th, 17--

My affection for my guest increases every day.  He excites at once my
admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.  How can I see so
noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant
grief?  He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and
when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,
yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.  He is now much
recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently
watching for the sledge that preceded his own.  Yet, although unhappy,
he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests
himself deeply in the projects of others.  He has frequently conversed
with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise.  He
entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual
success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to
secure it.  I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use
the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my
soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I
would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the
furtherance of my enterprise.  One man's life or death were but a small
price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for
the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of
our race.  As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's
countenance.  At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his
emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and
failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a
groan burst from his heaving breast.  I paused; at length he spoke, in
broken accents:  "Unhappy man!  Do you share my madness?  Have you
drunk also of the intoxicating draught?  Hear me; let me reveal my
tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!"

Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the
paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened
powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were
necessary to restore his composure.  Having conquered the violence of
his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of
passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to
converse concerning myself personally.  He asked me the history of my
earlier years.  The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various
trains of reflection.  I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my
thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever
fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of
little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.  "I agree with you,"
replied the stranger; "we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up,
if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves--such a friend ought to
be--do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I
once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled,
therefore, to judge respecting friendship.  You have hope, and the
world before you, and have no cause for despair.  But I--I have lost
everything and cannot begin life anew."

As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled
grief that touched me to the heart.  But he was silent and presently
retired to his cabin.

Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he
does the beauties of nature.  The starry sky, the sea, and every sight
afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of
elevating his soul from earth.  Such a man has a double existence:  he
may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he
has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a
halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.

Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine
wanderer?  You would not if you saw him.  You have been tutored and
refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore
somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to
appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.  Sometimes I
have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that
elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.  I
believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing
power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled
for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a
voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.


August 19, 17--

Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily perceive, Captain
Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.  I had
determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with
me, but you have won me to alter my determination.  You seek for
knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the
gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine
has been.  I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be
useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same
course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me
what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one
that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you
in case of failure.  Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually
deemed marvellous.  Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might
fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things
will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would
provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers
of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series
internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed."

You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered
communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by
a recital of his misfortunes.  I felt the greatest eagerness to hear
the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong
desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.  I expressed
these feelings in my answer.

"I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but it is useless; my
fate is nearly fulfilled.  I wait but for one event, and then I shall
repose in peace.  I understand your feeling," continued he, perceiving
that I wished to interrupt him; "but you are mistaken, my friend, if
thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny;
listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
determined."

He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when
I should be at leisure.  This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.
I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my
duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has
related during the day.  If I should be engaged, I will at least make
notes.  This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest
pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own
lips--with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future
day!  Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in
my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy
sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the
lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.

Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which
embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it--thus!



Chapter 1

I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most
distinguished of that republic.  My ancestors had been for many years
counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public
situations with honour and reputation.  He was respected by all who
knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public
business.  He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a
husband and the father of a family.

As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot
refrain from relating them.  One of his most intimate friends was a
merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
mischances, into poverty.  This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a
proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
distinguished for his rank and magnificence.  Having paid his debts,
therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
wretchedness.  My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and
was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
so little worthy of the affection that united them.  He lost no time in
endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin
the world again through his credit and assistance.

Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
months before my father discovered his abode.  Overjoyed at this
discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street
near the Reuss.  But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed
him.  Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of
his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for
some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable
employment in a merchant's house.  The interval was, consequently, spent
in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had
leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind
that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable
of any exertion.

His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw
with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that
there was no other prospect of support.  But Caroline Beaufort
possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support
her in her adversity.  She procured plain work; she plaited straw and
by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to
support life.

Several months passed in this manner.  Her father grew worse; her time
was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence
decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving
her an orphan and a beggar.  This last blow overcame her, and she knelt
by Beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
chamber.  He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who
committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he
conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a
relation.  Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.

There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but
this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted
affection.  There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind
which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love
strongly.  Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set
a greater value on tried worth.  There was a show of gratitude and
worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the
doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her
virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace
to his behaviour to her.  Everything was made to yield to her wishes
and her convenience.  He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is
sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her
with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
benevolent mind.  Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto
constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.  During
the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had
gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after
their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change
of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,
as a restorative for her weakened frame.

From Italy they visited Germany and France.  I, their eldest child, was
born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.  I
remained for several years their only child.  Much as they were
attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of
affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me.  My mother's
tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while
regarding me are my first recollections.  I was their plaything and
their idol, and something better--their child, the innocent and
helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good,
and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or
misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.  With this
deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they
had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated
both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life
I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was
so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment
to me. For a long time I was their only care.  My mother had much
desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring.
When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the
frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of
Como.  Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages
of the poor.  This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a
necessity, a passion--remembering what she had suffered, and how she
had been relieved--for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the
afflicted.  During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a
vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the
number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in
its worst shape.  One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan,
my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode.  She found a peasant
and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing
a scanty meal to five hungry babes.  Among these there was one which
attracted my mother far above all the rest.  She appeared of a
different stock.  The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little
vagrants; this child was thin and very fair.  Her hair was the
brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed
to set a crown of distinction on her head.  Her brow was clear and
ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her
face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being
heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features. The
peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and
admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.  She
was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman.  Her mother
was a German and had died on giving her birth.  The infant had been
placed with these good people to nurse:  they were better off then.
They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just
born.  The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in
the memory of the antique glory of Italy--one among the schiavi ognor
frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country.  He
became the victim of its weakness.  Whether he had died or still
lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known.  His property was
confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar.  She continued
with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a
garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.  When my father returned from
Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer
than pictured cherub--a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her
looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the
hills.  The apparition was soon explained.  With his permission my
mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her.
They were fond of the sweet orphan.  Her presence had seemed a blessing
to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want
when Providence afforded her such powerful protection.  They consulted
their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became
the inmate of my parents' house--my more than sister--the beautiful and
adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.

Everyone loved Elizabeth.  The passionate and almost reverential
attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my
pride and my delight.  On the evening previous to her being brought to
my home, my mother had said playfully, "I have a pretty present for my
Victor--tomorrow he shall have it."  And when, on the morrow, she
presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish
seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth
as mine--mine to protect, love, and cherish.  All praises bestowed on
her I received as made to a possession of my own.  We called each other
familiarly by the name of cousin.  No word, no expression could body
forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me--my more than
sister, since till death she was to be mine only.



Chapter 2

We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in
our ages.  I need not say that we were strangers to any species of
disunion or dispute.  Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and
the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us
nearer together.  Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated
disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;
and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home
--the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,
tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of
our Alpine summers--she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the
magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their
causes.  The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.
Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,
gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the
earliest sensations I can remember.

On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave
up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native
country.  We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive,
the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a
league from the city.  We resided principally in the latter, and the
lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.  It was my
temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.  I was
indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united
myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.  Henry
Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.  He was a boy of singular
talent and fancy.  He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for
its own sake.  He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.  He
composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and
knightly adventure.  He tried to make us act plays and to enter into
masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of
Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous
train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands
of the infidels.

No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.  My
parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.
We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to
their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights
which we enjoyed.  When I mingled with other families I distinctly
discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted
the development of filial love.

My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some
law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits
but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things
indiscriminately.  I confess that neither the structure of languages,
nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states
possessed attractions for me.  It was the secrets of heaven and earth
that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of
things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man
that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,
or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.

Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral
relations of things.  The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,
and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was
to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the
gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.  The saintly soul
of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of
her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.  She was
the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become
sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that
she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.  And
Clerval--could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?  Yet
he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his
generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for
adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of
beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring
ambition.

I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of
childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright
visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon
self.  Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record
those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of
misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that
passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a
mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but,
swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course,
has swept away all my hopes and joys.  Natural philosophy is the genius
that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to
state those facts which led to my predilection for that science.  When
I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the
baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a
day confined to the inn.  In this house I chanced to find a volume of
the works of Cornelius Agrippa.  I opened it with apathy; the theory
which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he
relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.  A new light seemed
to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my
discovery to my father.  My father looked carelessly at the title page
of my book and said, "Ah!  Cornelius Agrippa!  My dear Victor, do not
waste your time upon this; it is sad trash."

If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to
me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a
modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much
greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were
chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under
such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and
have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with
greater ardour to my former studies.  It is even possible that the
train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led
to my ruin.  But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by
no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I
continued to read with the greatest avidity.  When I returned home my
first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and
afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.  I read and studied the
wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me
treasures known to few besides myself.  I have described myself as
always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the
secrets of nature.  In spite of the intense labour and wonderful
discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies
discontented and unsatisfied.  Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed
that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and
unexplored ocean of truth.  Those of his successors in each branch of
natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy's
apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.

The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted
with their practical uses.  The most learned philosopher knew little
more.  He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal
lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.  He might dissect,
anatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes
in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.  I
had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep
human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and
ignorantly I had repined.

But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and
knew more.  I took their word for all that they averred, and I became
their disciple.  It may appear strange that such should arise in the
eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in
the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with
regard to my favourite studies.  My father was not scientific, and I
was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's
thirst for knowledge.  Under the guidance of my new preceptors I
entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the
philosopher's stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon
obtained my undivided attention.  Wealth was an inferior object, but
what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from
the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!
Nor were these my only visions.  The raising of ghosts or devils was a
promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of
which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always
unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience
and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.  And
thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an
unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately
in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent
imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the
current of my ideas.  When I was about fifteen years old we had retired
to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and
terrible thunderstorm.  It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura,
and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various
quarters of the heavens.  I remained, while the storm lasted, watching
its progress with curiosity and delight.  As I stood at the door, on a
sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak
which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the
dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained
but a blasted stump.  When we visited it the next morning, we found the
tree shattered in a singular manner.  It was not splintered by the
shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.  I never beheld
anything so utterly destroyed.

Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of
electricity.  On this occasion a man of great research in natural
philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on
the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of
electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.
All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,
Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by
some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my
accustomed studies.  It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever
be known.  All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
despicable.  By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps
most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former
occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed
and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of
real knowledge.  In this mood of mind I betook myself to the
mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as
being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.

Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments
are we bound to prosperity or ruin.  When I look back, it seems to me
as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the
immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life--the last effort
made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even
then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.  Her victory was
announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which
followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting
studies.  It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with
their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.

It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.
Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
terrible destruction.



Chapter 3

When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I
should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.  I had
hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it
necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made
acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.  My
departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day
resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life
occurred--an omen, as it were, of my future misery.  Elizabeth had
caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the
greatest danger.  During her illness many arguments had been urged to
persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.  She had at
first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of
her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She
attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the
malignity of the distemper--Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences
of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver.  On the third day my
mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming
symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the
worst event.  On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best
of women did not desert her.  She joined the hands of Elizabeth and
myself.  "My children," she said, "my firmest hopes of future happiness
were placed on the prospect of your union.  This expectation will now
be the consolation of your father.  Elizabeth, my love, you must supply
my place to my younger children.  Alas!  I regret that I am taken from
you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you
all?  But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to
resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting
you in another world."

She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent
by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the
soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.  It is so
long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day
and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed
forever--that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been
extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear
can be hushed, never more to be heard.  These are the reflections of
the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the
evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.  Yet from whom has
not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?  And why should I
describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?  The time at
length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and
the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a
sacrilege, is not banished.  My mother was dead, but we had still
duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the
rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the
spoiler has not seized.

My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,
was now again determined upon.  I obtained from my father a respite of
some weeks.  It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,
akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of
life.  I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.  I was
unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above
all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.

She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and
zeal.  She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call
her uncle and cousins.  Never was she so enchanting as at this time,
when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.

The day of my departure at length arrived.  Clerval spent the last
evening with us.  He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit
him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.  His
father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the
aspirations and ambition of his son.  Henry deeply felt the misfortune
of being debarred from a liberal education.  He said little, but when
he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a
restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details
of commerce.

We sat late.  We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor
persuade ourselves to say the word "Farewell!"  It was said, and we
retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the
other was deceived; but when at morning's dawn I descended to the
carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there--my father
again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to
renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last
feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.

I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged
in the most melancholy reflections.  I, who had ever been surrounded by
amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow
mutual pleasure--I was now alone.  In the university whither I was
going I must form my own friends and be my own protector.  My life had
hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me
invincible repugnance to new countenances.  I loved my brothers,
Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were "old familiar faces," but I believed
myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.  Such were my
reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits
and hopes rose.  I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.  I
had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth
cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my
station among other human beings.  Now my desires were complied with,
and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.

I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my
journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.  At length the
high white steeple of the town met my eyes.  I alighted and was
conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.

The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a
visit to some of the principal professors.  Chance--or rather the evil
influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway
over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's
door--led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.  He
was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He
asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different
branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.  I replied
carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my
alchemists as the principal authors I had studied.  The professor
stared.  "Have you," he said, "really spent your time in studying such
nonsense?"

I replied in the affirmative.  "Every minute," continued M. Krempe with
warmth, "every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly
and entirely lost.  You have burdened your memory with exploded systems
and useless names.  Good God!  In what desert land have you lived,
where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you
have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they
are ancient?  I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific
age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.  My dear
sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew."

So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books
treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and
dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following
week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural
philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow
professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he
omitted.

I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long
considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I
returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any
shape.  M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a
repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
favour of his pursuits.  In rather a too philosophical and connected a
strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come
to concerning them in my early years.  As a child I had not been
content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural
science.  With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my
extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the
steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the
discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
It was very different when the masters of the science sought
immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now
the scene was changed.  The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in
science was chiefly founded.  I was required to exchange chimeras of
boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.

Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my
residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming
acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new
abode.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information
which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.  And although I
could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver
sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.
Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.

Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the
lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.  This professor
was very unlike his colleague.  He appeared about fifty years of age,
but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey
hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were
nearly black.  His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice
the sweetest I had ever heard.  He began his lecture by a
recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements
made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names
of the most distinguished discoverers.  He then took a cursory view of
the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary
terms.  After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded
with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall
never forget:  "The ancient teachers of this science," said he,
"promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  The modern masters
promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and
that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose
hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the
microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles.  They penetrate
into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her
hiding-places.  They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how
the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.  They have
acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders
of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with
its own shadows."

Such were the professor's words--rather let me say such the words of
the fate--enounced to destroy me.  As he went on I felt as if my soul
were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were
touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was
sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,
one purpose.  So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of
Frankenstein--more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps
already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and
unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.

I closed not my eyes that night.  My internal being was in a state of
insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I
had no power to produce it.  By degrees, after the morning's dawn,
sleep came.  I awoke, and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream.
There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to
devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a
natural talent.  On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.  His
manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,
for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in
his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.  I
gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had
given to his fellow professor.  He heard with attention the little
narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius
Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had
exhibited. He said that "These were men to whose indefatigable zeal
modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their
knowledge.  They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names
and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a
great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.  The
labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind."  I
listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption
or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my
prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured
terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his
instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have
made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended
labours.  I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to
procure.

"I am happy," said M. Waldman, "to have gained a disciple; and if your
application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.
Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest
improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I
have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not
neglected the other branches of science.  A man would make but a very
sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge
alone.  If your wish is to become really a man of science and not
merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every
branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics."  He then took me
into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various
machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me
the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the
science not to derange their mechanism.  He also gave me the list of
books which I had requested, and I took my leave.

Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.



Chapter 4

From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the
most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.
I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,
which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.  I attended the
lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the
university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense
and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive
physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.  In
M. Waldman I found a true friend.  His gentleness was never tinged by
dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and
good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.  In a thousand ways
he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse
inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.  My application was at
first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and
soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the
light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.

As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress
was rapid.  My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and
my proficiency that of the masters.  Professor Krempe often asked me,
with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman
expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.  Two years
passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was
engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I
hoped to make.  None but those who have experienced them can conceive
of the enticements of science.  In other studies you go as far as
others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must
infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who
continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was
solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two
years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical
instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the
university.  When I had arrived at this point and had become as well
acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my
residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought
of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
happened that protracted my stay.

One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was
the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with
life.  Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a
mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
inquiries.  I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined
thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of
natural philosophy which relate to physiology.  Unless I had been
animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this
study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.  To examine the
causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.  I became
acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I
must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.  I do not ever
remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared
the apparition of a spirit.  Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and
a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of
life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become
food for the worm.  Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of
this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and
charnel-houses.  My attention was fixed upon every object the most
insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.  I saw how the
fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of
death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm
inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.  I paused, examining and
analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change
from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this
darkness a sudden light broke in upon me--a light so brilliant and
wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity
of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so
many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same
science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
secret.

Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.  The sun does not
more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is
true.  Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the
discovery were distinct and probable.  After days and nights of
incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of
generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing
animation upon lifeless matter.

The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery
soon gave place to delight and rapture.  After so much time spent in
painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the
most gratifying consummation of my toils.  But this discovery was so
great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been
progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.
What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation
of the world was now within my grasp.  Not that, like a magic scene, it
all opened upon me at once:  the information I had obtained was of a
nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them
towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already
accomplished.  I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead
and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly
ineffectual light.

I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes
express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with
which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end
of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that
subject.  I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,
to your destruction and infallible misery.  Learn from me, if not by my
precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of
knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town
to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature
will allow.

When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated
a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.
Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to
prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of
fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
difficulty and labour.  I doubted at first whether I should attempt the
creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my
imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to
doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful
as man.  The materials at present within my command hardly appeared
adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should
ultimately succeed.  I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my
operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be
imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes
place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present
attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.  Nor
could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any
argument of its impracticability.  It was with these feelings that I
began the creation of a human being.  As the minuteness of the parts
formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first
intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,
about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.  After having
formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully
collecting and arranging my materials, I began.

No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like
a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.  Life and death
appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and
pour a torrent of light into our dark world.  A new species would bless
me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
owe their being to me.  No father could claim the gratitude of his
child so completely as I should deserve theirs.  Pursuing these
reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless
matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)
renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.

These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking
with unremitting ardour.  My cheek had grown pale with study, and my
person had become emaciated with confinement.  Sometimes, on the very
brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the
next day or the next hour might realize.  One secret which I alone
possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon
gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.  Who shall conceive
the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps
of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless
clay?  My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but
then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed
to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.  It was
indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had
returned to my old habits.  I collected bones from charnel-houses and
disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
frame.  In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,
and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.  The
dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;
and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,
whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I
brought my work near to a conclusion.

The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in
one pursuit.  It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields
bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant
vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.  And the
same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had
not seen for so long a time.  I knew my silence disquieted them, and I
well remembered the words of my father:  "I know that while you are
pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall
hear regularly from you.  You must pardon me if I regard any
interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties
are equally neglected."

I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings, but I could
not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which
had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.  I wished, as it
were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection
until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,
should be completed.

I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect
to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was
justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from
blame.  A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
disturb his tranquillity.  I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge
is an exception to this rule.  If the study to which you apply yourself
has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for
those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that
study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human
mind.  If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit
whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic
affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his
country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the
empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.

But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my
tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.  My father made no reproach
in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my
occupations more particularly than before.  Winter, spring, and summer
passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the
expanding leaves--sights which before always yielded me supreme
delight--so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.  The leaves of
that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now
every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded.  But my
enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one
doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade
than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.  Every night I was
oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful
degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow
creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.  Sometimes I grew alarmed
at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose
alone sustained me:  my labours would soon end, and I believed that
exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I
promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.



Chapter 5

It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment
of my toils.  With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I
collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a
spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was
already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the
panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the
half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature
open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.

How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate
the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to
form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as
beautiful.  Beautiful!  Great God!  His yellow skin scarcely covered
the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous
black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these
luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,
that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which
they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.

The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings
of human nature.  I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole
purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.  For this I had
deprived myself of rest and health.  I had desired it with an ardour
that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty
of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my
heart.  Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I
rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my
bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.  At length lassitude
succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the
bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest
dreams.  I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in
the streets of Ingolstadt.  Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,
but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with
the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I
held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her
form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my
teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and
yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window
shutters, I beheld the wretch--the miserable monster whom I had
created.  He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they
may be called, were fixed on me.  His jaws opened, and he muttered some
inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.  He might have
spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to
detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.  I took refuge in the
courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained
during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest
agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if
it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I
had so miserably given life.

Oh!  No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.  A mummy
again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.  I
had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those
muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing
such as even Dante could not have conceived.

I passed the night wretchedly.  Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and
hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly
sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.  Mingled with
this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had
been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a
hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!

Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my
sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple
and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.  The porter opened the gates
of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into
the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the
wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my
view.  I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but
felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured
from a black and comfortless sky.

I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by
bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.  I
traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or
what I was doing.  My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I
hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:


  Like one who, on a lonely road,
  Doth walk in fear and dread,
  And, having once turned round, walks on,
  And turns no more his head;
  Because he knows a frightful fiend
  Doth close behind him tread.

  [Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner."]


Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the
various diligences and carriages usually stopped.  Here I paused, I
knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach
that was coming towards me from the other end of the street.  As it
drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just
where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry
Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out.  "My dear
Frankenstein," exclaimed he, "how glad I am to see you!  How fortunate
that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!"

Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought
back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home
so dear to my recollection.  I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot
my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time
during many months, calm and serene joy.  I welcomed my friend,
therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my
college.  Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual
friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to
Ingolstadt.  "You may easily believe," said he, "how great was the
difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not
comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I
left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my
unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in
The Vicar of Wakefield:  'I have ten thousand florins a year without
Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.'  But his affection for me at
length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to
undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge."

"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left
my father, brothers, and Elizabeth."

"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from
you so seldom.  By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their
account myself.  But, my dear Frankenstein," continued he, stopping
short and gazing full in my face, "I did not before remark how very ill
you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for
several nights."

"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one
occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;
but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an
end and that I am at length free."

I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.  I walked with a
quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.  I then reflected, and
the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my
apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.  I dreaded to
behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.
Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
stairs, I darted up towards my own room.  My hand was already on the
lock of the door before I recollected myself.  I then paused, and a
cold shivering came over me.  I threw the door forcibly open, as
children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.  I stepped
fearfully in:  the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed
from its hideous guest.  I could hardly believe that so great a good
fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy
had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.

We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;
but I was unable to contain myself.  It was not joy only that possessed
me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse
beat rapidly.  I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same
place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.
Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,
but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes
for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless
laughter frightened and astonished him.

"My dear Victor," cried he, "what, for God's sake, is the matter?  Do
not laugh in that manner.  How ill you are!  What is the cause of all
this?"

"Do not ask me," cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I
thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; "HE can tell.
Oh, save me!  Save me!"  I imagined that the monster seized me; I
struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.

Poor Clerval!  What must have been his feelings?  A meeting, which he
anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.  But I
was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not
recover my senses for a long, long time.

This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for
several months.  During all that time Henry was my only nurse.  I
afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age and unfitness
for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make
Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my
disorder.  He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive
nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he
did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest
action that he could towards them.

But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and
unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was forever
before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.  Doubtless my
words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings
of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I
continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder
indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.

By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and
grieved my friend, I recovered.  I remember the first time I became
capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I
perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young
buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.  It was
a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my
convalescence.  I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in
my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as
cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.

"Dearest Clerval," exclaimed I, "how kind, how very good you are to me.
This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised
yourself, has been consumed in my sick room.  How shall I ever repay
you?  I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I
have been the occasion, but you will forgive me."

"You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get
well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I
may speak to you on one subject, may I not?"

I trembled.  One subject!  What could it be?  Could he allude to an
object on whom I dared not even think?  "Compose yourself," said
Clerval, who observed my change of colour, "I will not mention it if it
agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they
received a letter from you in your own handwriting.  They hardly know
how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence."

"Is that all, my dear Henry?  How could you suppose that my first
thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and
who are so deserving of my love?"

"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to
see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from
your cousin, I believe."



Chapter 6

Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.  It was from my
own Elizabeth:

"My dearest Cousin,

"You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear
kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.  You are
forbidden to write--to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,
is necessary to calm our apprehensions.  For a long time I have thought
that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have
restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.  I have
prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so
long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to
perform it myself!  I figure to myself that the task of attending on
your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never
guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of
your poor cousin.  Yet that is over now:  Clerval writes that indeed
you are getting better.  I eagerly hope that you will confirm this
intelligence soon in your own handwriting.

"Get well--and return to us.  You will find a happy, cheerful home and
friends who love you dearly.  Your father's health is vigorous, and he
asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a
care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.  How pleased you would
be to remark the improvement of our Ernest!  He is now sixteen and full
of activity and spirit.  He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter
into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his
elder brother returns to us.  My uncle is not pleased with the idea of
a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your
powers of application.  He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his
time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the
lake.  I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point
and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.

"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken
place since you left us.  The blue lake and snow-clad mountains--they
never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are
regulated by the same immutable laws.  My trifling occupations take up
my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing
none but happy, kind faces around me.  Since you left us, but one
change has taken place in our little household.  Do you remember on
what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?  Probably you do not;
I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.  Madame Moritz,
her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the
third.  This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but
through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and
after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill.  My aunt observed
this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother
to allow her to live at our house.  The republican institutions of our
country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which
prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.  Hence there is less
distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the
lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are
more refined and moral.  A servant in Geneva does not mean the same
thing as a servant in France and England.  Justine, thus received in
our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our
fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a
sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.

"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I
recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one
glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that
Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica--she looked so
frank-hearted and happy.  My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,
by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that
which she had at first intended.  This benefit was fully repaid;
Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:  I do not
mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but
you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,
yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.  She
thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her
phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.

"When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own
grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness
with the most anxious affection.  Poor Justine was very ill; but other
trials were reserved for her.

"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.  The
conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the
deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her
partiality.  She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor
confirmed the idea which she had conceived.  Accordingly, a few months
after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her
repentant mother.  Poor girl!  She wept when she quitted our house; she
was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness
and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable
for vivacity.  Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature
to restore her gaiety.  The poor woman was very vacillating in her
repentance.  She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,
but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her
brothers and sister.  Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz
into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is
now at peace for ever.  She died on the first approach of cold weather,
at the beginning of this last winter.  Justine has just returned to us;
and I assure you I love her tenderly.  She is very clever and gentle,
and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her
expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.

"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling
William.  I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with
sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.  When he
smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with
health.  He has already had one or two little WIVES, but Louisa Biron
is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.

"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little
gossip concerning the good people of Geneva.  The pretty Miss Mansfield
has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching
marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.  Her ugly
sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your
favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes
since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.  But he has already
recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a
lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.  She is a widow, and much
older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with
everybody.

"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety
returns upon me as I conclude.  Write, dearest Victor,--one line--one
word will be a blessing to us.  Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his
kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely
grateful.  Adieu!  my cousin; take care of your self; and, I entreat
you, write!

"Elizabeth Lavenza.

"Geneva, March 18, 17--."


"Dear, dear Elizabeth!" I exclaimed, when I had read her letter:  "I
will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel."
I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence
had commenced, and proceeded regularly.  In another fortnight I was
able to leave my chamber.

One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the
several professors of the university.  In doing this, I underwent a
kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had
sustained.  Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the
beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even
to the name of natural philosophy.  When I was otherwise quite restored
to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony
of my nervous symptoms.  Henry saw this, and had removed all my
apparatus from my view.  He had also changed my apartment; for he
perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
previously been my laboratory.  But these cares of Clerval were made of
no avail when I visited the professors.  M. Waldman inflicted torture
when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I
had made in the sciences.  He soon perceived that I disliked the
subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to
modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science
itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.  What
could I do?  He meant to please, and he tormented me.  I felt as if he
had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which
were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.  I
writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.
Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the
sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his
total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.  I
thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.  I saw plainly
that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from
me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence
that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in
him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which
I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.

M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of
almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me
even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman.  "D--n
the fellow!" cried he; "why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript
us all.  Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.  A
youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as
firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the
university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of
countenance.--Ay, ay," continued he, observing my face expressive of
suffering, "M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young
man.  Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M.
Clerval:  I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short
time."

M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned
the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.

Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science; and his
literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.  He
came to the university with the design of making himself complete
master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for
the plan of life he had marked out for himself.  Resolved to pursue no
inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording
scope for his spirit of enterprise.  The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit
languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on
the same studies.  Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I
wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt
great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not
only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.  I
did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for
I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary
amusement.  I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well
repaid my labours.  Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of
any other country.  When you read their writings, life appears to
consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,--in the smiles and frowns
of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.  How
different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!

Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was
fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several
accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,
and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.  I felt this
delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved
friends.  My return had only been delayed so long, from an
unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become
acquainted with any of its inhabitants.  The winter, however, was spent
cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came
its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.

The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily
which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a
pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a
personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.  I acceded
with pleasure to this proposition:  I was fond of exercise, and Clerval
had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature
that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.

We passed a fortnight in these perambulations:  my health and spirits
had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the
salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and
the conversation of my friend.  Study had before secluded me from the
intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but
Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught
me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
Excellent friend!  how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to
elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.  A selfish
pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and
affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature
who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.
When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most
delightful sensations.  A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with
ecstasy.  The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.  I
was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed
upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an
invincible burden.

Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings:
he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that
filled his soul.  The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly
astonishing:  his conversation was full of imagination; and very often,
in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of
wonderful fancy and passion.  At other times he repeated my favourite
poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great
ingenuity.  We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon:  the
peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.  My
own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled
joy and hilarity.



Chapter 7

On my return, I found the following letter from my father:--


"My dear Victor,

"You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of
your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few
lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.  But
that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.  What would be
your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?  And how, Victor, can
I relate our misfortune?  Absence cannot have rendered you callous to
our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent
son?  I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is
impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words
which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.

"William is dead!--that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed
my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!  Victor, he is murdered!

"I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the
circumstances of the transaction.

"Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to
walk in Plainpalais.  The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged
our walk farther than usual.  It was already dusk before we thought of
returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone
on before, were not to be found.  We accordingly rested on a seat until
they should return.  Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen
his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William
had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and
afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.

"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him
until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have
returned to the house.  He was not there.  We returned again, with
torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had
lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;
Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.  About five in the morning I
discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and
active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the
print of the murder's finger was on his neck.

"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my
countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.  She was very earnest to
see the corpse.  At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,
and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the
victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God!  I have murdered my
darling child!'

"She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.  When she again
lived, it was only to weep and sigh.  She told me, that that same
evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable
miniature that she possessed of your mother.  This picture is gone, and
was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.  We
have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him
are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!

"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.  She weeps
continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;
her words pierce my heart.  We are all unhappy; but will not that be an
additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?
Your dear mother!  Alas, Victor!  I now say, Thank God she did not live
to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!

"Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,
but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of
festering, the wounds of our minds.  Enter the house of mourning, my
friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not
with hatred for your enemies.

               "Your affectionate and afflicted father,
                              "Alphonse Frankenstein.



"Geneva, May 12th, 17--."

Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was
surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first
expressed on receiving new from my friends.  I threw the letter on the
table, and covered my face with my hands.

"My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with
bitterness, "are you always to be unhappy?  My dear friend, what has
happened?"

I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the
room in the extremest agitation.  Tears also gushed from the eyes of
Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.

"I can offer you no consolation, my friend," said he; "your disaster is
irreparable.  What do you intend to do?"

"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses."

During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;
he could only express his heartfelt sympathy.  "Poor William!" said he,
"dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother!  Who that had
seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his
untimely loss!  To die so miserably; to feel the murderer's grasp!  How
much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence!  Poor little
fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but
he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.  He can no longer
be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable
survivors."

Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words
impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in
solitude.  But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a
cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.

My journey was very melancholy.  At first I wished to hurry on, for I
longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends;
but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress.  I could
hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.  I
passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen
for nearly six years.  How altered every thing might be during that
time!  One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand
little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations,
which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less
decisive.  Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand
nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define
them.  I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.
I contemplated the lake:  the waters were placid; all around was calm;
and the snowy mountains, 'the palaces of nature,' were not changed.  By
degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my
journey towards Geneva.

The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I
approached my native town.  I discovered more distinctly the black
sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.  I wept like a
child.  "Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your
wanderer?  Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and
placid.  Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?"

I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on
these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative
happiness, and I think of them with pleasure.  My country, my beloved
country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again
beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely
lake!

Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.  Night
also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I
felt still more gloomily.  The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of
evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most
wretched of human beings.  Alas!  I prophesied truly, and failed only
in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and
dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was
destined to endure.  It was completely dark when I arrived in the
environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was
obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of
half a league from the city.  The sky was serene; and, as I was unable
to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been
murdered.  As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross
the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.  During this short voyage
I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most
beautiful figures.  The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on
landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress.  It
advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming
slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.

I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm
increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash
over my head.  It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps of
Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the
lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself
from the preceding flash.  The storm, as is often the case in
Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.  The
most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the
lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of
Copet.  Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another
darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked mountain to the
east of the lake.

While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on
with a hasty step.  This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I
clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, "William, dear angel! this is
thy funeral, this thy dirge!" As I said these words, I perceived in the
gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I
stood fixed, gazing intently:  I could not be mistaken.  A flash of
lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to
me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous
than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch,
the filthy daemon, to whom I had given life.  What did he there?  Could
he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?  No
sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of
its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree
for support.  The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.

Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.  HE was the
murderer!  I could not doubt it.  The mere presence of the idea was an
irresistible proof of the fact.  I thought of pursuing the devil; but
it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me
hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont
Saleve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south.  He soon reached
the summit, and disappeared.

I remained motionless.  The thunder ceased; but the rain still
continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.  I
revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:
the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of
the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.  Two years had
now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and
was this his first crime?  Alas!  I had turned loose into the world a
depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not
murdered my brother?

No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the
night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.  But I did not
feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in
scenes of evil and despair.  I considered the being whom I had cast
among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes
of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light
of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced
to destroy all that was dear to me.

Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.  The gates were
open, and I hastened to my father's house.  My first thought was to
discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be
made.  But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A
being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at
midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.  I
remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at
the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of
delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.  I well knew that
if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have
looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.  Besides, the strange nature
of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited
as to persuade my relatives to commence it.  And then of what use would
be pursuit?  Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
overhanging sides of Mont Saleve?  These reflections determined me, and
I resolved to remain silent.

It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house.  I
told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library
to attend their usual hour of rising.

Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace,
and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father
before my departure for Ingolstadt.  Beloved and venerable parent!  He
still remained to me.  I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood
over the mantel-piece.  It was an historical subject, painted at my
father's desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of
despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.  Her garb was
rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty,
that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity.  Below this picture was a
miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.  While
I was thus engaged, Ernest entered:  he had heard me arrive, and
hastened to welcome me:  "Welcome, my dearest Victor," said he.  "Ah! I
wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us
all joyous and delighted.  You come to us now to share a misery which
nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our
father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions
will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting
self-accusations.--Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!"

Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal
agony crept over my frame.  Before, I had only imagined the
wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and
a not less terrible, disaster.  I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more
minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.

"She most of all," said Ernest, "requires consolation; she accused
herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her
very wretched.  But since the murderer has been discovered--"

"The murderer discovered!  Good God! how can that be? who could attempt
to pursue him?  It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the
winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.  I saw him too; he
was free last night!"

"I do not know what you mean," replied my brother, in accents of
wonder, "but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.  No
one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be
convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.  Indeed, who would credit
that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,
could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?"

"Justine Moritz!  Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?  But it is
wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?"

"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have
almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so
confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,
leaves no hope for doubt.  But she will be tried today, and you will
then hear all."

He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William
had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her
bed for several days.  During this interval, one of the servants,
happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the
murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which
had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.  The servant
instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to
any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,
Justine was apprehended.  On being charged with the fact, the poor girl
confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
manner.

This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied
earnestly, "You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.  Justine, poor,
good Justine, is innocent."

At that instant my father entered.  I saw unhappiness deeply impressed
on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,
"Good God, papa!  Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of
poor William."

"We do also, unfortunately," replied my father, "for indeed I had
rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much
depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly."

"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent."

"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.  She is to be
tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted."

This speech calmed me.  I was firmly convinced in my own mind that
Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.  I
had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be
brought forward strong enough to convict her.  My tale was not one to
announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as
madness by the vulgar.  Did any one indeed exist, except I, the
creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the
existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance
which I had let loose upon the world?

We were soon joined by Elizabeth.  Time had altered her since I last
beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of
her childish years.  There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but
it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.
She welcomed me with the greatest affection.  "Your arrival, my dear
cousin," said she, "fills me with hope.  You perhaps will find some
means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.  Alas! who is safe, if she
be convicted of crime?  I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do
upon my own.  Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only
lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely
love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.  If she is condemned, I
never shall know joy more.  But she will not, I am sure she will not;
and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little
William."

"She is innocent, my Elizabeth," said I, "and that shall be proved;
fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her
acquittal."

"How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,
and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible:  and to
see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me
hopeless and despairing."  She wept.

"Dearest niece," said my father, "dry your tears.  If she is, as you
believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity
with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality."



Chapter 8

We passed a few sad hours until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to
commence.  My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend
as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.  During the whole of
this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.  It was to
be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would
cause the death of two of my fellow beings:  one a smiling babe full of
innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every
aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised
to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an
ignominious grave, and I the cause!  A thousand times rather would I
have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I
was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have
been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have
exculpated her who suffered through me.

The appearance of Justine was calm.  She was dressed in mourning, and
her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her
feelings, exquisitely beautiful.  Yet she appeared confident in
innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by
thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the
imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.  She
was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as
her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she
worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.  When she entered the
court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were
seated.  A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly
recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest
her utter guiltlessness.

The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the
charge, several witnesses were called.  Several strange facts combined
against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof
of her innocence as I had.  She had been out the whole of the night on
which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been
perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the
murdered child had been afterwards found.  The woman asked her what she
did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused
and unintelligible answer.  She returned to the house about eight
o'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she
replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly
if anything had been heard concerning him.  When shown the body, she
fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.  The
picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;
and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round
his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.

Justine was called on for her defence.  As the trial had proceeded, her
countenance had altered.  Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly
expressed.  Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was
desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible
although variable voice.

"God knows," she said, "how entirely I am innocent.  But I do not
pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on
a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced
against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline
my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears
doubtful or suspicious."

She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed
the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the
house of an aunt at Chene, a village situated at about a league from
Geneva.  On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man who asked
her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.  She was
alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,
when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain
several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being
unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.  Most
of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that
she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.
It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour
to find my brother.  If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,
it was without her knowledge.  That she had been bewildered when
questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed
a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.
Concerning the picture she could give no account.

"I know," continued the unhappy victim, "how heavily and fatally this
one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining
it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to
conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been
placed in my pocket.  But here also I am checked.  I believe that I
have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to
destroy me wantonly.  Did the murderer place it there?  I know of no
opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have
stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?

"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for
hope.  I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my
character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my
innocence."

Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and
they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they
supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come
forward.  Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,
when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address
the court.

"I am," said she, "the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or
rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his
parents ever since and even long before his birth.  It may therefore be
judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see
a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I
know of her character.  I am well acquainted with the accused.  I have
lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another
for nearly two years.  During all that period she appeared to me the
most amiable and benevolent of human creatures.  She nursed Madame
Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection
and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious
illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her,
after which she again lived in my uncle's house, where she was beloved
by all the family.  She was warmly attached to the child who is now
dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.  For my own
part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence
produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence.  She
had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the
chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have
willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her."

A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful
appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in
favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with
renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.  She
herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.  My own
agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.  I believed
in her innocence; I knew it.  Could the demon who had (I did not for a
minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have
betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?  I could not sustain the
horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and
the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,
I rushed out of the court in agony.  The tortures of the accused did
not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of
remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.

I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.  In the morning I went to
the court; my lips and throat were parched.  I dared not ask the fatal
question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my
visit.  The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine
was condemned.

I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.  I had before
experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon
them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the
heart-sickening despair that I then endured.  The person to whom I
addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.
"That evidence," he observed, "was hardly required in so glaring a
case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to
condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so
decisive."

This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?  Had
my eyes deceived me?  And was I really as mad as the whole world would
believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?  I
hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.

"My cousin," replied I, "it is decided as you may have expected; all
judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty
should escape.  But she has confessed."

This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness
upon Justine's innocence.  "Alas!" said she.  "How shall I ever again
believe in human goodness?  Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my
sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she
has committed a murder."

Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see
my cousin.  My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to
her own judgment and feelings to decide.  "Yes," said Elizabeth, "I
will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I
cannot go alone."  The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I
could not refuse.  We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld
Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were
manacled, and her head rested on her knees.  She rose on seeing us
enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the
feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.  My cousin wept also.

"Oh, Justine!" said she.  "Why did you rob me of my last consolation?
I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I
was not so miserable as I am now."

"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?  Do you also
join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?" Her
voice was suffocated with sobs.

"Rise, my poor girl," said Elizabeth; "why do you kneel, if you are
innocent?  I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless,
notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself
declared your guilt.  That report, you say, is false; and be assured,
dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment,
but your own confession."

"I did confess, but I confessed a lie.  I confessed, that I might
obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than
all my other sins.  The God of heaven forgive me!  Ever since I was
condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,
until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I
was.  He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if
I continued obdurate.  Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked
on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.  What could I do?
In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly
miserable."

She paused, weeping, and then continued, "I thought with horror, my
sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed
aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable
of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
Dear William! dearest blessed child!  I soon shall see you again in
heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I
am to suffer ignominy and death."

"Oh, Justine!  Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
Why did you confess?  But do not mourn, dear girl.  Do not fear.  I
will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.  I will melt the stony
hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.  You shall not die!
You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!
No!  No!  I never could survive so horrible a misfortune."

Justine shook her head mournfully.  "I do not fear to die," she said;
"that pang is past.  God raises my weakness and gives me courage to
endure the worst.  I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember
me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the
fate awaiting me.  Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to
the will of heaven!"

During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,
where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.  Despair!
Who dared talk of that?  The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass
the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such
deep and bitter agony.  I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,
uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.  Justine started.  When
she saw who it was, she approached me and said, "Dear sir, you are very
kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?"

I could not answer.  "No, Justine," said Elizabeth; "he is more
convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you
had confessed, he did not credit it."

"I truly thank him.  In these last moments I feel the sincerest
gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.  How sweet is
the affection of others to such a wretch as I am!  It removes more than
half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my
innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin."

Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.  She indeed
gained the resignation she desired.  But I, the true murderer, felt the
never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or
consolation.  Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was
the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair
moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.  Anguish and
despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within
me which nothing could extinguish.  We stayed several hours with
Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear
herself away.  "I wish," cried she, "that I were to die with you; I
cannot live in this world of misery."

Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
repressed her bitter tears.  She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice
of half-suppressed emotion, "Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,
my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and
preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
suffer!  Live, and be happy, and make others so."

And on the morrow Justine died.  Elizabeth's heart-rending eloquence
failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the
criminality of the saintly sufferer.  My passionate and indignant
appeals were lost upon them.  And when I received their cold answers
and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed
avowal died away on my lips.  Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,
but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.  She
perished on the scaffold as a murderess!

From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and
voiceless grief of my Elizabeth.  This also was my doing!  And my
father's woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was
the work of my thrice-accursed hands!  Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these
are not your last tears!  Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and
the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!
Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he
who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no
thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear
countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life
in serving you--he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond
his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!

Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,
I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and
Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.



Chapter 9

Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have
been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of
inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope
and fear.  Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.  The blood flowed
freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my
heart which nothing could remove.  Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered
like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond
description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet
behind.  Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.
I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment
when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow
beings.  Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience
which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and
from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and
the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures
such as no language can describe.

This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never
entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.  I shunned
the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;
solitude was my only consolation--deep, dark, deathlike solitude.

My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my
disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the
feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with
fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which
brooded over me.  "Do you think, Victor," said he, "that I do not
suffer also?  No one could love a child more than I loved your
brother"--tears came into his eyes as he spoke--"but is it not a duty
to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their
unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?  It is also a duty
owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or
enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no
man is fit for society."

This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I
should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if
remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my
other sensations.  Now I could only answer my father with a look of
despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.

About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.  This change was
particularly agreeable to me.  The shutting of the gates regularly at
ten o'clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that
hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome
to me.  I was now free.  Often, after the rest of the family had
retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the
water.  Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and
sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to
pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.  I
was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only
unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and
heavenly--if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and
interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore--often,
I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters
might close over me and my calamities forever.  But I was restrained,
when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly
loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.  I thought also of my
father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them
exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose
among them?

At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my
mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness.  But that
could not be.  Remorse extinguished every hope.  I had been the author
of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I
had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.  I had an obscure
feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some
signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the
recollection of the past.  There was always scope for fear so long as
anything I loved remained behind.  My abhorrence of this fiend cannot
be conceived.  When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became
inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so
thoughtlessly bestowed.  When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my
hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.  I would have made a
pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I when there have
precipitated him to their base.  I wished to see him again, that I
might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the
deaths of William and Justine.  Our house was the house of mourning. My
father's health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events.
Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her
ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the
dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she
should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.  She was no longer
that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks
of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.  The first
of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited
her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.

"When I reflect, my dear cousin," said she, "on the miserable death of
Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before
appeared to me.  Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and
injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient
days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to
reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men
appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's blood.  Yet I am
certainly unjust.  Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and
if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly
she would have been the most depraved of human creatures.  For the sake
of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,
a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if
it had been her own!  I could not consent to the death of any human
being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to
remain in the society of men.  But she was innocent.  I know, I feel
she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.
Alas!  Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can
assure themselves of certain happiness?  I feel as if I were walking on
the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and
endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.  William and Justine were
assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,
and perhaps respected.  But even if I were condemned to suffer on the
scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a
wretch."

I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.  I, not in deed,
but in effect, was the true murderer.  Elizabeth read my anguish in my
countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, "My dearest friend, you
must calm yourself.  These events have affected me, God knows how
deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.  There is an expression of
despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me
tremble.  Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.  Remember the
friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.  Have we lost
the power of rendering you happy?  Ah!  While we love, while we are
true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native
country, we may reap every tranquil blessing--what can disturb our
peace?"

And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every
other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my
heart?  Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at
that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.

Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of
heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were
ineffectual.  I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial
influence could penetrate.  The wounded deer dragging its fainting
limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had
pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.

Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but
sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily
exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable
sensations.  It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left
my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought
in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and
my ephemeral, because human, sorrows.  My wanderings were directed
towards the valley of Chamounix.  I had visited it frequently during my
boyhood.  Six years had passed since then:  _I_ was a wreck, but nought
had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.

I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.  I afterwards
hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive
injury on these rugged roads.  The weather was fine; it was about the
middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of
Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.  The
weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in
the ravine of Arve.  The immense mountains and precipices that overhung
me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and
the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as
Omnipotence--and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less
almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here
displayed in their most terrific guise.  Still, as I ascended higher,
the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.
Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the
impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from
among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.  But it was
augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and
shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another
earth, the habitations of another race of beings.

I passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river
forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that
overhangs it.  Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.  This
valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and
picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.  The
high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no
more ruined castles and fertile fields.  Immense glaciers approached
the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and
marked the smoke of its passage.  Mont Blanc, the supreme and
magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles,
and its tremendous dome overlooked the valley.

A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this
journey.  Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and
recognized, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.  The very winds whispered in soothing
accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.  Then again the
kindly influence ceased to act--I found myself fettered again to grief
and indulging in all the misery of reflection.  Then I spurred on my
animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,
myself--or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on
the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.

At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.  Exhaustion succeeded
to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.
For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid
lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of
the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.  The same lulling sounds
acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head
upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed
the giver of oblivion.



Chapter 10

I spent the following day roaming through the valley.  I stood beside
the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that
with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to
barricade the valley.  The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before
me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling
waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the
avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the
accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,
was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
their hands.  These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the
greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.  They elevated me
from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my
grief, they subdued and tranquillized it.  In some degree, also, they
diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the
last month.  I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I
had contemplated during the day.  They congregated round me; the
unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,
and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds--they all
gathered round me and bade me be at peace.

Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?  All of
soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every
thought.  The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the
summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those
mighty friends.  Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them
in their cloudy retreats.  What were rain and storm to me?  My mule was
brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of
Montanvert.  I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous
and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.
It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the
soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the
effect of solemnizing my mind and causing me to forget the passing
cares of life.  I determined to go without a guide, for I was well
acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the
solitary grandeur of the scene.

The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short
windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the
mountain.  It is a scene terrifically desolate.  In a thousand spots
the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie
broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,
leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon
other trees.  The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is
particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking
in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw
destruction upon the head of the speaker.  The pines are not tall or
luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers
which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I
received from the objects around me.  Alas!  Why does man boast of
sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders
them more necessary beings.  If our impulses were confined to hunger,
thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by
every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may
convey to us.


  We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
   We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the day.
  We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
   Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
  It is the same:  for, be it joy or sorrow,
   The path of its departure still is free.
  Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
   Nought may endure but mutability!


It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.  For some
time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.  A mist covered
both that and the surrounding mountains.  Presently a breeze dissipated
the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.  The surface is very
uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
interspersed by rifts that sink deep.  The field of ice is almost a
league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.  The
opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.  From the side where I
now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;
and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.  I remained in a recess
of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.  The sea,
or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.  Their icy and glittering
peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.  My heart, which was
before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,
"Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow
beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,
away from the joys of life."

As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
advancing towards me with superhuman speed.  He bounded over the
crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his
stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.  I was
troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,
but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.  I
perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)
that it was the wretch whom I had created.  I trembled with rage and
horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in
mortal combat.  He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.  But I scarcely
observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,
and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
detestation and contempt.

"Devil," I exclaimed, "do you dare approach me?  And do not you fear
the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?  Begone,
vile insect!  Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust!  And,
oh!  That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence,
restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!"

"I expected this reception," said the daemon.  "All men hate the
wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all
living things!  Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,
to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of
one of us.  You purpose to kill me.  How dare you sport thus with life?
Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of
mankind.  If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and
you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it
be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends."

"Abhorred monster!  Fiend that thou art!  The tortures of hell are too
mild a vengeance for thy crimes.  Wretched devil!  You reproach me with
your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I
so negligently bestowed."

My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the
feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.

He easily eluded me and said,

"Be calm!  I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred
on my devoted head.  Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to
increase my misery?  Life, although it may only be an accumulation of
anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.  Remember, thou hast made
me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
joints more supple.  But I will not be tempted to set myself in
opposition to thee.  I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and
docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,
the which thou owest me.  Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every
other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy
clemency and affection, is most due.  Remember that I am thy creature;
I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou
drivest from joy for no misdeed.  Everywhere I see bliss, from which I
alone am irrevocably excluded.  I was benevolent and good; misery made
me a fiend.  Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous."

"Begone!  I will not hear you.  There can be no community between you
and me; we are enemies.  Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,
in which one must fall."

"How can I move thee?  Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a
favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and
compassion?  Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed
with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?  You, my
creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,
who owe me nothing?  They spurn and hate me.  The desert mountains and
dreary glaciers are my refuge.  I have wandered here many days; the
caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the
only one which man does not grudge.  These bleak skies I hail, for they
are kinder to me than your fellow beings.  If the multitude of mankind
knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for
my destruction.  Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?  I will keep
no terms with my enemies.  I am miserable, and they shall share my
wretchedness.  Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver
them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that
not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be
swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.  Let your compassion be
moved, and do not disdain me.  Listen to my tale; when you have heard
that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.
But hear me.  The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they
are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.  Listen
to me, Frankenstein.  You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with
a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.  Oh, praise the
eternal justice of man!  Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,
and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands."

"Why do you call to my remembrance," I rejoined, "circumstances of
which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and
author?  Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw
light!  Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!
You have made me wretched beyond expression.  You have left me no power
to consider whether I am just to you or not.  Begone!  Relieve me from
the sight of your detested form."

"Thus I relieve thee, my creator," he said, and placed his hated hands
before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; "thus I take from
thee a sight which you abhor.  Still thou canst listen to me and grant
me thy compassion.  By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this
from you.  Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of
this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon
the mountain.  The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends
to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another
world, you will have heard my story and can decide.  On you it rests,
whether I quit forever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless
life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of
your own speedy ruin."

As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.  My heart
was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the
various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to
his tale.  I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my
resolution.  I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my
brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards
his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I
complained of his wickedness.  These motives urged me to comply with
his demand.  We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite
rock.  The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we
entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy
heart and depressed spirits.  But I consented to listen, and seating
myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began
his tale.



Chapter 11

"It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of
my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,
and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I
learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.  By
degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I
was obliged to shut my eyes.  Darkness then came over me and troubled
me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now
suppose, the light poured in upon me again.  I walked and, I believe,
descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my
touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with
no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.  The light
became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I
walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.  This was the
forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting
from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.  This
roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I
found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.  I slaked my thirst
at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.

"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it
were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.  Before I had quitted
your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some
clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of
night.  I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could
distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat
down and wept.

"Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of
pleasure.  I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the
trees.  [The moon]  I gazed with a kind of wonder.  It moved slowly,
but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.
I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with
which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.  No distinct
ideas occupied my mind; all was confused.  I felt light, and hunger,
and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on
all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could
distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with
pleasure.

"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had
greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each
other.  I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with
drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.  I was delighted
when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my
ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had
often intercepted the light from my eyes.  I began also to observe,
with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the
boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.  Sometimes I
tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.
Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the
uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into
silence again.

"The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened
form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.  My
sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every
day additional ideas.  My eyes became accustomed to the light and to
perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from
the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.  I found that the
sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and
thrush were sweet and enticing.

"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been
left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the
warmth I experienced from it.  In my joy I thrust my hand into the live
embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.  How strange,
I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!  I
examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be
composed of wood.  I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet
and would not burn.  I was pained at this and sat still watching the
operation of the fire.  The wet wood which I had placed near the heat
dried and itself became inflamed.  I reflected on this, and by touching
the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in
collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a
plentiful supply of fire.  When night came on and brought sleep with
it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.  I
covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches
upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank
into sleep.

"It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.
I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.  I
observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the
embers when they were nearly extinguished.  When night came again I
found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that
the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found
some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and
tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.  I
tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on
the live embers.  I found that the berries were spoiled by this
operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.

"Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day
searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When
I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto
inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be
more easily satisfied.  In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the
loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how
to reproduce it.  I gave several hours to the serious consideration of
this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply
it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood
towards the setting sun.  I passed three days in these rambles and at
length discovered the open country.  A great fall of snow had taken
place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the
appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold
damp substance that covered the ground.

"It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and
shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which
had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.  This
was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great
curiosity.  Finding the door open, I entered.  An old man sat in it,
near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.  He turned on
hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the
hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form
hardly appeared capable.  His appearance, different from any I had ever
before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.  But I was enchanted
by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not
penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite
and divine a retreat as Pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell
after their sufferings in the lake of fire.  I greedily devoured the
remnants of the shepherd's breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,
milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.  Then, overcome by
fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.

"It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which
shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my
travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a
wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until
at sunset I arrived at a village.  How miraculous did this appear!  The
huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by
turns.  The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw
placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One
of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within
the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.
The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,
grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I
escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,
quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had
beheld in the village.  This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat
and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I
dared not enter it.  My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so
low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.  No wood, however,
was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and
although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an
agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.

"Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,
however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more
from the barbarity of man.  As soon as morning dawned I crept from my
kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could
remain in the habitation I had found.  It was situated against the back
of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig
sty and a clear pool of water.  One part was open, and by that I had
crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived
with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on
occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and
that was sufficient for me.

"Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I
retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered
too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.  I
had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf
of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink
more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by
my retreat.  The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept
perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was
tolerably warm.

"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until
something should occur which might alter my determination.  It was
indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,
the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.  I ate my breakfast with
pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little
water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld
a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The
girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found
cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.  Yet she was meanly dressed, a
coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair
hair was plaited but not adorned:  she looked patient yet sad.  I lost
sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing
the pail, which was now partly filled with milk.  As she walked along,
seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose
countenance expressed a deeper despondence.  Uttering a few sounds with
an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the
cottage himself.  She followed, and they disappeared.  Presently I saw
the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field
behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the
house and sometimes in the yard.

"On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the
cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been
filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost
imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.
Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean
but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an
old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The
young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she
took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat
down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play
and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the
nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had
never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent
countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle
manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air
which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of
which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then
pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt
at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection
that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,
either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the
window, unable to bear these emotions.

"Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a
load of wood.  The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of
his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on
the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,
and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.  She seemed
pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she
placed in water, and then upon the fire.  She afterwards continued her
work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily
employed in digging and pulling up roots.  After he had been employed
thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the
cottage together.

"The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance
of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to
eat.  The meal was quickly dispatched.  The young woman was again
occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the
cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.
Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent
creatures.  One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming
with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his
figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his
eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.  The
old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different
from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the
fields.

"Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the
cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was
delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the
pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.  In the evening
the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations
which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the
instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in
the morning.  So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,
but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the
harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since
found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the
science of words or letters.

"The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,
extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest."



Chapter 12

"I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.  I thought of the
occurrences of the day.  What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners
of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.  I
remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from
the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I
might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would
remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the
motives which influenced their actions.

"The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.  The young woman
arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed
after the first meal.

"This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.
The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in
various laborious occupations within.  The old man, whom I soon
perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or
in contemplation.  Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the
younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.  They
performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with
gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.

"They were not entirely happy.  The young man and his companion often
went apart and appeared to weep.  I saw no cause for their unhappiness,
but I was deeply affected by it.  If such lovely creatures were
miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,
should be wretched.  Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?  They
possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every
luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands
when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,
they enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging each day
looks of affection and kindness.  What did their tears imply?  Did they
really express pain?  I was at first unable to solve these questions,
but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which
were at first enigmatic.

"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of
the uneasiness of this amiable family:  it was poverty, and they
suffered that evil in a very distressing degree.  Their nourishment
consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of
one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters
could scarcely procure food to support it.  They often, I believe,
suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two
younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old
man when they reserved none for themselves.

"This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.  I had been accustomed,
during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own
consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on
the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and
roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.

"I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist
their labours.  I found that the youth spent a great part of each day
in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often
took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home
firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.

"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she
opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a
great pile of wood on the outside.  She uttered some words in a loud
voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise.  I
observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but
spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.

"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.  I found that
these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and
feelings to one another by articulate sounds.  I perceived that the
words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or
sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers.  This was indeed
a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.
But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose.  Their
pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any
apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any
clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.  By great
application, however, and after having remained during the space of
several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names
that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I
learned and applied the words, 'fire,' 'milk,' 'bread,' and 'wood.'  I
learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.  The youth and his
companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one,
which was 'father.' The girl was called 'sister' or 'Agatha,' and the
youth 'Felix,' 'brother,' or 'son.'  I cannot describe the delight I
felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and
was able to pronounce them.  I distinguished several other words
without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as 'good,'
'dearest,' 'unhappy.'

"I spent the winter in this manner.  The gentle manners and beauty of
the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I
felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys.  I saw
few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the
cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the
superior accomplishments of my friends.  The old man, I could perceive,
often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that
he called them, to cast off their melancholy.  He would talk in a
cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure
even upon me.  Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled
with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I
generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after
having listened to the exhortations of her father.  It was not thus
with Felix.  He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my
unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his
friends.  But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more
cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old
man.

"I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked
the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.  In the midst of poverty
and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little
white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.  Early in
the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that
obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and
brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual
astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible
hand.  In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring
farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,
yet brought no wood with him.  At other times he worked in the garden,
but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old
man and Agatha.

"This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I
discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when
he talked.  I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs
for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend
these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand
the sounds for which they stood as signs?  I improved, however,
sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of
conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I
easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to
the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become
master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them
overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast
perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.

"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers--their grace, beauty,
and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself
in a transparent pool!  At first I started back, unable to believe that
it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became
fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was
filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
Alas!  I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable
deformity.

"As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow
vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.  From this
time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of
impending famine disappeared.  Their food, as I afterwards found, was
coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.
Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they
dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season
advanced.

"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did
not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its
waters.  This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the
earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.

"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.  During the morning I
attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in
various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in
observing my friends.  When they had retired to rest, if there was any
moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected
my own food and fuel for the cottage.  When I returned, as often as it
was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those
offices that I had seen done by Felix.  I afterwards found that these
labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and
once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words 'good
spirit,' 'wonderful'; but I did not then understand the signification
of these terms.

"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the
motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to
know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.  I thought
(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to
these deserving people.  When I slept or was absent, the forms of the
venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix
flitted before me.  I looked upon them as superior beings who would be
the arbiters of my future destiny.  I formed in my imagination a
thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of
me.  I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle
demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and
afterwards their love.

"These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to
the acquiring the art of language.  My organs were indeed harsh, but
supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their
tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.
It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose
intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved
better treatment than blows and execration.

"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the
aspect of the earth.  Men who before this change seemed to have been
hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of
cultivation.  The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves
began to bud forth on the trees.  Happy, happy earth!  Fit habitation
for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and
unwholesome.  My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of
nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,
and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy."



Chapter 13

"I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.  I shall relate
events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,
have made me what I am.

"Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies
cloudless.  It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy
should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.  My
senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and
a thousand sights of beauty.

"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested
from labour--the old man played on his guitar, and the children
listened to him--that I observed the countenance of Felix was
melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father
paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired
the cause of his son's sorrow.  Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and
the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.

"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.
The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black
veil.  Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by
pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.  Her voice was
musical but unlike that of either of my friends.  On hearing this word,
Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her
veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.  Her
hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular
proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with
a lovely pink.

"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of
sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of
ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his
eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I
thought him as beautiful as the stranger.  She appeared affected by
different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held
out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as
well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.  She did not appear to
understand him, but smiled.  He assisted her to dismount, and
dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.  Some
conversation took place between him and his father, and the young
stranger knelt at the old man's feet and would have kissed his hand,
but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.

"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds
and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood
by nor herself understood the cottagers.  They made many signs which I
did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness
through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the
morning mists.  Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of
delight welcomed his Arabian.  Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed
the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made
signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she
came.  Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,
expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.  Presently I
found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger
repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;
and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the
same instructions to the same end.  The stranger learned about twenty
words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had
before understood, but I profited by the others.

"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.  When they
separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, 'Good night
sweet Safie.'  He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and
by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely
guest was the subject of their conversation.  I ardently desired to
understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found
it utterly impossible.

"The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual
occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the
old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly
beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my
eyes.  She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or
dying away like a nightingale of the woods.

"When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first
declined it.  She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in
sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.  The old
man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to
explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she
bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.

"The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration
that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the
knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most
of the words uttered by my protectors.

"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and
the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the
scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;
the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal
rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably
shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never
ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same
treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.

"My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily
master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than
the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken
accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that
was spoken.

"While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as
it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field
for wonder and delight.

"The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's Ruins of
Empires.  I should not have understood the purport of this book had not
Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.  He had chosen
this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in
imitation of the Eastern authors.  Through this work I obtained a
cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at
present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners,
governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth.  I
heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental
activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early
Romans--of their subsequent degenerating--of the decline of that mighty
empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.  I heard of the discovery
of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of
its original inhabitants.

"These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.  Was
man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so
vicious and base?  He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil
principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and
godlike.  To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour
that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on
record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more
abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.  For a long time I
could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or
even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of
vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and
loathing.

"Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.
While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the
Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.  I
heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid
poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.

"The words induced me to turn towards myself.  I learned that the
possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and
unsullied descent united with riches.  A man might be respected with
only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,
except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to
waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!  And what was I? Of
my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I
possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.  I was, besides,
endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even
of the same nature as man.  I was more agile than they and could
subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with
less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.  When I looked
around I saw and heard of none like me.  Was I, then, a monster, a blot
upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?

"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted
upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with
knowledge.  Oh, that I had forever remained in my native wood, nor
known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!

"Of what a strange nature is knowledge!  It clings to the mind when it
has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.  I wished sometimes to
shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one
means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death--a state
which I feared yet did not understand.  I admired virtue and good
feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my
cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except
through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and
unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of
becoming one among my fellows.  The gentle words of Agatha and  the
animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.  The mild
exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved
Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!

"Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.  I heard of the
difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the
father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the
older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up
in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained
knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which
bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.

"But where were my friends and relations?  No father had watched my
infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if
they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I
distinguished nothing.  From my earliest remembrance I had been as I
then was in height and proportion.  I had never yet seen a being
resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.  What was I?  The
question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.

"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to
return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various
feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated
in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in
an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them)."



Chapter 14

"Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.  It was
one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding
as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to
one so utterly inexperienced as I was.

"The name of the old man was De Lacey.  He was descended from a good
family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,
respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.  His son was bred
in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the
highest distinction.  A few months before my arrival they had lived in
a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and
possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or
taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.

"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.  He was a
Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some
reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.
He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from
Constantinople to join him.  He was tried and condemned to death.  The
injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;
and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime
alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.

"Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and
indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the
court.  He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then
looked around for the means.  After many fruitless attempts to gain
admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the
unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the
execution of the barbarous sentence.  Felix visited the grate at night
and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.  The Turk,
amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer
by promises of reward and wealth.  Felix rejected his offers with
contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit
her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the
youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed
a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.

"The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made
on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in
his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he
should be conveyed to a place of safety.  Felix was too delicate to
accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the
event as to the consummation of his happiness.

"During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for
the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several
letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to
express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old
man, a servant of her father who understood French.  She thanked him in
the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and
at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.

"I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence
in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters
were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.  Before I depart I will
give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,
as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat
the substance of them to you.

"Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a
slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of
the father of Safie, who married her.  The young girl spoke in high and
enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the
bondage to which she was now reduced.  She instructed her daughter in
the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female
followers of Muhammad.  This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly
impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,
allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to
the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble
emulation for virtue.  The prospect of marrying a Christian and
remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in
society was enchanting to her.

"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night
previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant
many leagues from Paris.  Felix had procured passports in the name of
his father, sister, and himself.  He had previously communicated his
plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in
an obscure part of Paris.

"Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont
Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable
opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.

"Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his
departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she
should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in
expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society
of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest
affection.  They conversed with one another through the means of an
interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie
sang to him the divine airs of her native country.

"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes
of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other
plans.  He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a
Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear
lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer
if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they
inhabited.  He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled
to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and
secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.  His plans
were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.

"The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their
victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.  The
plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were
thrown into prison.  The news reached Felix and roused him from his
dream of pleasure.  His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay
in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of
her whom he loved.  This idea was torture to him.  He quickly arranged
with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity
for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a
boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,
he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the
law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.

"He did not succeed.  They remained confined for five months before the
trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune
and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.

"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I
discovered them.  Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for
whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on
discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,
became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with
his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,
as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.

"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered
him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.  He could
have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his
virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss
of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.  The
arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.

"When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth
and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her
lover, but to prepare to return to her native country.  The generous
nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to
expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his
tyrannical mandate.

"A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter's apartment and told
her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn
had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the
French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to
Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.  He
intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential
servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his
property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.

"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it
would become her to pursue in this emergency.  A residence in Turkey
was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse
to it.  By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she
heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where
he then resided.  She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her
determination.  Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a
sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,
but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for
Germany.

"She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage
of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.  Safie nursed her
with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the
Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country
and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.  She fell, however,
into good hands.  The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for
which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in
which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at
the cottage of her lover."



Chapter 15

"Such was the history of my beloved cottagers.  It impressed me deeply.
I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire
their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.

"As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and
generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to
become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities
were called forth and displayed.  But in giving an account of the
progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred
in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.

"One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I
collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I
found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles
of dress and some books.  I eagerly seized the prize and returned with
it to my hovel.  Fortunately the books were written in the language,
the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of
Paradise Lost, a volume of Plutarch's Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter.
The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now
continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst
my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.

"I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.  They produced
in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.  In
the Sorrows of Werter, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon
what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a
never-ending source of speculation and astonishment.  The gentle and
domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded
well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which
were forever alive in my own bosom.  But I thought Werter himself a
more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character
contained no pretension, but it sank deep.  The disquisitions upon
death and suicide were calculated to fill  me with wonder.  I did not
pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards
the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely
understanding it.

"As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and
condition.  I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely
unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I
was a listener.  I sympathized with and partly understood them, but I
was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.
'The path of my departure was free,' and there was none to lament my
annihilation.  My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.  What did
this mean?  Who was I?  What was I?  Whence did I come?  What was my
destination?  These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to
solve them.

"The volume of Plutarch's Lives which I possessed contained the
histories of the first founders of the ancient republics.  This book
had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter.  I
learned from Werter's imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch
taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my
own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.  Many
things I read surpassed my understanding and experience.  I had a very
confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,
and boundless seas.  But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and
large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the
only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book
developed new and mightier scenes of action.  I read of men concerned
in public affairs, governing or massacring their species.  I felt the
greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as
far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they
were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.  Induced by these
feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,
Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.  The
patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a
firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had
been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should
have been imbued with different sensations.

"But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions.  I read
it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as
a true history.  It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the
picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of
exciting.  I often referred the several situations, as their similarity
struck me, to my own.  Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to
any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine
in every other respect.  He had come forth from the hands of God a
perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of
his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from
beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.
Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for
often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter
gall of envy rose within me.

"Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.  Soon
after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of
the dress which I had taken from your laboratory.  At first I had
neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in
which they were written, I began to study them with diligence.  It was
your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.  You
minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress
of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic
occurrences.  You doubtless recollect these papers.  Here they are.
Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed
origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances
which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own
horrors and rendered mine indelible.  I sickened as I read.  'Hateful
day when I received life!' I exclaimed in agony.  'Accursed creator!
Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in
disgust?  God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the
very resemblance.  Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire
and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.'

"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;
but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and
benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should
become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they  would
compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity.  Could they turn
from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion
and friendship?  I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way
to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.  I
postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance
attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.
Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every
day's experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking
until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.

"Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.  The
presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also
found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.  Felix and Agatha
spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in
their labours by servants.  They did not appear rich, but they were
contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while
mine became every day more tumultuous.  Increase of knowledge only
discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.  I
cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person
reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail
image and that inconstant shade.

"I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial
which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my
thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and
dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my
feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed
smiles of consolation.  But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my
sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.  I remembered Adam's
supplication to his Creator.  But where was mine?  He had abandoned me,
and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.

"Autumn passed thus.  I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay
and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it
had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.  Yet I did
not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my
conformation for the endurance of cold than heat.  But my chief
delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay
apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention
towards the cottagers.  Their happiness was not decreased by the
absence of summer.  They loved and sympathized with one another; and
their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the
casualties that took place around them.  The more I saw of them, the
greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my
heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see
their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost
limit of my ambition.  I dared not think that they would turn them from
me with disdain and horror.  The poor that stopped at their door were
never driven away.  I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a
little food or rest:  I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not
believe myself utterly unworthy of it.

"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken
place since I awoke into life.  My attention at this time was solely
directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my
protectors.  I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally
fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.
I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my
person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly
beheld me.  My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I
thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain
the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means
be tolerated by my younger protectors.

"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground
and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,
and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own
desire, was left alone in the cottage.  When his children had departed,
he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more
sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.  At first his
countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,
thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.

"My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which
would decide my hopes or realize my fears.  The servants were gone to a
neighbouring fair.  All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an
excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my
limbs failed me and I sank to the ground.  Again I rose, and exerting
all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had
placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat.  The fresh air revived
me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their
cottage.

"I knocked.  'Who is there?' said the old man.  'Come in.'

"I entered.  'Pardon this intrusion,' said I; 'I am a traveller in want
of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to
remain a few minutes before the fire.'

"'Enter,' said De Lacey, 'and I will try in what manner I can to
relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and
as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food
for you.'

"'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and
rest only that I need.'

"I sat down, and a silence ensued.  I knew that every minute was
precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence
the interview, when the old man addressed me.  'By your language,
stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?'

"'No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that
language only.  I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,
whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.'

"'Are they Germans?'

"'No, they are French.  But let us change the subject.  I am an
unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation
or friend upon earth.  These amiable people to whom I go have never
seen me and know little of me.  I am full of fears, for if I fail
there, I am an outcast in the world forever.'

"'Do not despair.  To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but
the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are
full of brotherly love and charity.  Rely, therefore, on your hopes;
and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.'

"'They are kind--they are the most excellent creatures in the world;
but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.  I have good
dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree
beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they
ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable
monster.'

"'That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot
you undeceive them?'

"'I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I
feel so many overwhelming terrors.  I tenderly love these friends; I
have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily
kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and
it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.'

"'Where do these friends reside?'

"'Near this spot.'

"The old man paused and then continued, 'If you will unreservedly
confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in
undeceiving them.  I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but
there is something in your words which persuades me that you are
sincere.  I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure
to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.'

"'Excellent man!  I thank you and accept your generous offer.  You
raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,
I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow
creatures.'

"'Heaven forbid!  Even if you were really criminal, for that can only
drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.  I also am
unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;
judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.'

"'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?  From your lips
first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall
be forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success
with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.'

"'May I know the names and residence of those friends?'

"I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to
rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever.  I struggled vainly for
firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my
remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud.  At that
moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.  I had not a moment
to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, 'Now is the
time!  Save and protect me!  You and your family are the friends whom I
seek.  Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!'

"'Great God!' exclaimed the old man.  'Who are you?'

"At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and
Agatha entered.  Who can describe their horror and consternation on
beholding me?  Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her
friend, rushed out of the cottage.  Felix darted forward, and with
supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in
a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently
with a stick.  I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends
the antelope.  But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and
I refrained.  I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,
overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general
tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel."



Chapter 16

"Cursed, cursed creator!  Why did I live?  Why, in that instant, did I
not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly
bestowed?  I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my
feelings were those of rage and revenge.  I could with pleasure have
destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with
their shrieks and misery.

"When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and
now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my
anguish in fearful howlings.  I was like a wild beast that had broken
the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging
through the wood with a stag-like swiftness.  Oh!  What a miserable
night I passed!  The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees
waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird
burst forth amidst the universal stillness.  All, save I, were at rest
or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and
finding myself unsympathized with, wished to tear up the trees, spread
havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed
the ruin.

"But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became
fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in
the sick impotence of despair.  There was none among the myriads of men
that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness
towards my enemies?  No; from that moment I declared everlasting war
against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me
and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.

"The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was
impossible to return to my retreat during that day.  Accordingly I hid
myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours
to reflection on my situation.

"The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some
degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the
cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my
conclusions.  I had certainly acted imprudently.  It was apparent that
my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and  I was a
fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.  I
ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to
have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have
been  prepared for my approach.  But I did not believe my errors to be
irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the
cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my
party.

"These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound
sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by
peaceful dreams.  The horrible scene of the preceding day was forever
acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix
tearing me from his father's feet.  I awoke exhausted, and finding that
it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in
search of food.

"When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the
well-known path that conducted to the cottage.  All there was at peace.
I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the
accustomed hour when the family arose.  That hour passed, the sun
mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.  I
trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.  The inside
of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the
agony of this suspense.

"Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they
entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not
understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,
which differed from that of my protectors.  Soon after, however, Felix
approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not
quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from
his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.

"'Do you consider,' said his companion to him, 'that you will be
obliged to pay three months' rent and to lose the produce of your
garden?  I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg
therefore that you will take some days to consider of your
determination.'

"'It is utterly useless,' replied Felix; 'we can never again inhabit
your cottage.  The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing
to the dreadful circumstance that I have related.  My wife and my
sister will never recover from their horror.  I entreat you not to
reason with me any more.  Take possession of your tenement and let me
fly from this place.'

"Felix trembled violently as he said this.  He and his companion
entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then
departed.  I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.

"I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of
utter and stupid despair.  My protectors had departed and had broken
the only link that held me to the world.  For the first time the
feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to
control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I
bent my mind towards injury and death.  When I thought of my friends,
of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the
exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of
tears somewhat soothed me.  But again when I reflected that they had
spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to
injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.  As
night advanced I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,
and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,
I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my
operations.

"As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly
dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore
along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my
spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.  I lighted the
dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,
my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon
nearly touched.  A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my
brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,
and bushes, which I had collected.  The wind fanned the fire, and the
cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and
licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.

"As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of
the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.

"And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?  I
resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated
and despised, every country must be equally horrible.  At length the
thought of you crossed my mind.  I learned from your papers that you
were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness
than to him who had given me life?  Among the lessons that Felix had
bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from
these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.
You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards
this place I resolved to proceed.

"But how was I to direct myself?  I knew that I must travel in a
southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my
only guide.  I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass
through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I
did not despair.  From you only could I hope for succour, although
towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.  Unfeeling,
heartless creator!  You had endowed me with perceptions and passions
and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.
But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I
determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from
any other being that wore the human form.

"My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense.  It was
late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.
I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a
human being.  Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;
rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface
of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.  Oh,
earth!  How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!  The
mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall
and bitterness.  The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more
deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.  Snow
fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.  A few incidents
now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I
often wandered wide from my path.  The agony of my feelings allowed me
no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could
not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived
on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth
and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial
manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.

"I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was
secured by night from the view of man.  One morning, however, finding
that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey
after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,
cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
the air.  I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long
appeared dead, revive within me.  Half surprised by the novelty of
these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and
forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.  Soft tears
again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with
thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.

"I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its
boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many
of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.
Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard
the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade
of a cypress.  I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running
towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from
someone in sport.  She continued her course along the precipitous sides
of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the
rapid stream.  I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,
from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore.  She
was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore
animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,
who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled.  On
seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,
hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.  I followed speedily, I
hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,
which he carried, at my body and fired.  I sank to the ground, and my
injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.

"This was then the reward of my benevolence!  I had saved a human being
from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable
pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone.  The feelings of
kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments
before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.  Inflamed by
pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.  But the
agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.

"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to
cure the wound which I had received.  The ball had entered my shoulder,
and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
rate I had no means of extracting it.  My sufferings were augmented
also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their
infliction.  My daily vows rose for revenge--a deep and deadly revenge,
such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had
endured.

"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.  The
labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or
gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my
desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for
the enjoyment of pleasure.

"But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I
reached the environs of Geneva.

"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among
the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply
to you.  I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to
enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting
behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.

"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,
which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came
running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of
infancy.  Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this
little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have
imbibed a horror of deformity.  If, therefore, I could seize him and
educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in
this peopled earth.

"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him
towards me.  As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before
his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his
face and said, 'Child, what is the meaning of this?  I do not intend to
hurt you; listen to me.'

"He struggled violently.  'Let me go,' he cried; 'monster!  Ugly
wretch!  You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces.  You are an ogre.
Let me go, or I will tell my papa.'

"'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.'

"'Hideous monster!  Let me go.  My papa is a syndic--he is M.
Frankenstein--he will punish you.  You dare not keep me.'

"'Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy--to him towards whom I have
sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.'

"The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried
despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a
moment he lay dead at my feet.

"I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish
triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, 'I too can create desolation;
my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and
a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.'

"As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his
breast.  I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.  In spite
of my malignity, it softened and attracted me.  For a few moments I
gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her
lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was
forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could
bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in
regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one
expressive of disgust and affright.

"Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?  I only
wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in
exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the
attempt to destroy them.

"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had
committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I
entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.  A woman was
sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her
whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the
loveliness of youth and health.  Here, I thought, is one of those whose
joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.  And then I bent over
her and whispered, 'Awake, fairest, thy lover is near--he who would
give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my
beloved, awake!'

"The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.  Should she
indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus
would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.
The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me--not I, but
she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am forever
robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.  The crime had
its source in her; be hers the punishment!  Thanks to the lessons of
Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work
mischief.  I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of
the folds of her dress.  She moved again, and I fled.

"For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,
sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and
its miseries forever.  At length I wandered towards these mountains,
and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning
passion which you alone can gratify.  We may not part until you have
promised to comply with my requisition.  I am alone and miserable; man
will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself
would not deny herself to me.  My companion must be of the same species
and have the same defects.  This being you must create."



Chapter 17

The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the
expectation of a reply.  But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to
arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his
proposition.  He continued,

"You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the
interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.  This you alone
can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to
concede."

The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had
died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and
as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within
me.

"I do refuse it," I replied; "and no torture shall ever extort a
consent from me.  You may render me the most miserable of men, but you
shall never make me base in my own eyes.  Shall I create another like
yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.  Begone!  I
have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent."

"You are in the wrong," replied the fiend; "and instead of threatening,
I am content to reason with you.  I am malicious because I am
miserable.  Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?  You, my
creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell
me why I should pity man more than he pities me?  You would not call it
murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and
destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.  Shall I respect man when
he condemns me?  Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness,
and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears
of gratitude at his acceptance.  But that cannot be; the human senses
are insurmountable barriers to our union.  Yet mine shall not be the
submission of abject slavery.  I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot
inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy,
because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred.  Have a care; I
will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart,
so that you shall curse the hour of your birth."

A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled
into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently
he calmed himself and proceeded--

"I intended to reason.  This passion is detrimental to me, for you do
not reflect that YOU are the cause of its excess.  If any being felt
emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and
a hundredfold; for that one creature's sake I would make peace with the
whole kind!  But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be
realized.  What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a
creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is
small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me.  It
is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that
account we shall be more attached to one another.  Our lives will not
be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now
feel.  Oh!  My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards
you for one benefit!  Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some
existing thing; do not deny me my request!"

I was moved.  I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences
of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.
His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature
of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion
of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?  He saw my change of
feeling and continued,

"If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see
us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America.  My food is not
that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;
acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.  My companion will
be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.
We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on
man and will ripen our food.  The picture I present to you is peaceful
and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the
wantonness of power and cruelty.  Pitiless as you have been towards me,
I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment
and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire."

"You propose," replied I, "to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell
in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only
companions.  How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,
persevere in this exile?  You will return and again seek their
kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions
will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the
task of destruction.  This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I
cannot consent."

"How inconstant are your feelings!  But a moment ago you were moved by
my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my
complaints?  I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you
that made me, that with the companion you bestow I will quit the
neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of
places.  My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with
sympathy!  My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I
shall not curse my maker."

His words had a strange effect upon me.  I compassionated him and
sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when
I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my
feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.  I tried to stifle
these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathize with him, I
had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which
was yet in my power to bestow.

"You swear," I said, "to be harmless; but have you not already shown a
degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?  May not
even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a
wider scope for your revenge?"

"How is this?  I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.  If
I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;
the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall
become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.  My vices
are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will
necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.  I shall feel
the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of
existence and events from which I am now excluded."

I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various
arguments which he had employed.  I thought of the promise of virtues
which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the
subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which
his protectors had manifested towards him.  His power and threats were
not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice
caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of
inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be
vain to cope with.  After a long pause of reflection I concluded that
the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that
I should comply with his request.  Turning to him, therefore, I said,

"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever,
and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall
deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile."

"I swear," he cried, "by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by
the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer,
while they exist you shall never behold me again.  Depart to your home
and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with
unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall
appear."

Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in
my sentiments.  I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than
the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the
sea of ice.

His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of
the horizon when he departed.  I knew that I ought to hasten my descent
towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my
heart was heavy, and my steps slow.  The labour of winding among the
little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced
perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences
of the day had produced.  Night was far advanced when I came to the
halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.  The stars
shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines
rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the
ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange
thoughts within me.  I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I
exclaimed, "Oh!  Stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock
me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as
nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness."

These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you
how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I
listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its
way to consume me.

Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no
rest, but returned immediately to Geneva.  Even in my own heart I could
give no expression to my sensations--they weighed on me with a
mountain's weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.
Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the
family.  My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I
answered no question, scarcely did I speak.  I felt as if I were placed
under a ban--as if I had no right to claim their sympathies--as if
never more might I enjoy companionship with them.  Yet even thus I
loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate
myself to my most abhorred task.  The prospect of such an occupation
made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,
and that thought only had to me the reality of life.



Chapter 18

Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and
I could not collect the courage to recommence my work.  I feared the
vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my
repugnance to the task which was enjoined me.  I found that I could not
compose a female without again devoting several months to profound
study and laborious disquisition.  I had heard of some discoveries
having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was
material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my
father's consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to
every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an
undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to
me.  A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had
hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.  My
father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts
towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring
blackness overcast the approaching sunshine.  At these moments I took
refuge in the most perfect solitude.  I passed whole days on the lake
alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the
rippling of the waves, silent and listless.  But the fresh air and
bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and
on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
and a more cheerful heart.

It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,
calling me aside, thus addressed me,

"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former
pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.  And yet you are still
unhappy and still avoid our society.  For some time I was lost in
conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,
and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.  Reserve on such a
point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all."

I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued--"I
confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage
with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay
of my declining years.  You were attached to each other from your
earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions
and tastes, entirely suited to one another.  But so blind is the
experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my
plan may have entirely destroyed it.  You, perhaps, regard her as your
sister, without any wish that she might become your wife.  Nay, you may
have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as
bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant
misery which you appear to feel."

"My dear father, reassure yourself.  I love my cousin tenderly and
sincerely.  I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my
warmest admiration and affection.  My future hopes and prospects are
entirely bound up in the expectation of our union."

"The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,
gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.  If you
feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast
a gloom over us.  But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so
strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.  Tell me,
therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the
marriage.  We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us
from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You
are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent
fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future
plans of honour and utility that you may have formed.  Do not suppose,
however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on
your part would cause me any serious uneasiness.  Interpret my words
with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and
sincerity."

I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable
of offering any reply.  I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of
thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.  Alas!  To me
the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and
dismay.  I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled
and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not
impend over me and my devoted family!  Could I enter into a festival
with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the
ground?  I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with
his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from
which I expected peace.

I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers
of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable
use to me in my present undertaking.  The latter method of obtaining
the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I
had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my
loathsome task in my father's house while in habits of familiar
intercourse with those I loved.  I knew that a thousand fearful
accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to
thrill all connected with me with horror.  I was aware also that I
should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the
harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my
unearthly occupation.  I must absent myself from all I loved while thus
employed.  Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be
restored to my family in peace and happiness.  My promise fulfilled,
the monster would depart forever.  Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some
accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my
slavery forever.

These feelings dictated my answer to my father.  I expressed a wish to
visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I
clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I
urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to
comply.  After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that
resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find
that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,
and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my
return, have restored me entirely to myself.

The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or
at most a year, was the period contemplated.  One paternal kind
precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.  Without
previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,
arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasbourg.  This interfered
with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the
commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be
an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many
hours of lonely, maddening reflection.  Nay, Henry might stand between
me and the intrusion of my foe.  If I were alone, would he not at times
force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to
contemplate its progress?

To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union
with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.  My father's
age rendered him extremely averse to delay.  For myself, there was one
reward I promised myself from my detested toils--one consolation for my
unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,
enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and
forget the past in my union with her.

I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me
which filled me with fear and agitation.  During my absence I should
leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and
unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my
departure.  But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and
would he not accompany me to England?  This imagination was dreadful in
itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.
I was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of
this might happen.  But through the whole period during which I was the
slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of
the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend
would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his
machinations.

It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native
country.  My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth
therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of
my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.  It had
been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval--and yet a man
is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman's
sedulous attention.  She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand
conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent
farewell.

I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly
knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.
I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on
it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with
me.  Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful
and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.  I could
only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy
me whilst they endured.

After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed
many leagues, I arrived at Strasbourg, where I waited two days for
Clerval.  He came.  Alas, how great was the contrast between us!  He
was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the
setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new
day.  He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and
the appearances of the sky.  "This is what it is to live," he cried;
"how I enjoy existence!  But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are
you desponding and sorrowful!" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden
sunrise reflected in the Rhine.  And you, my friend, would be far more
amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an
eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.  I, a
miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
enjoyment.

We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to
Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.  During this
voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.
We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from
Strasbourg, arrived at Mainz.  The course of the Rhine below Mainz
becomes much more picturesque.  The river descends rapidly and winds
between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.  We saw
many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
black woods, high and inaccessible.  This part of the Rhine, indeed,
presents a singularly variegated landscape.  In one spot you view
rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with
the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,
flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river
and populous towns occupy the scene.

We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the
labourers as we glided down the stream.  Even I, depressed in mind, and
my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased.
I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue
sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a
stranger.  And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of
Henry?  He felt as if he had been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed
a happiness seldom tasted by man.  "I have seen," he said, "the most
beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne
and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to
the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a
gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands
that believe the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake
agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and
gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean;
and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest
and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying
voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind;
I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this
country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.  The mountains
of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in
the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.  Look
at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and
now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that
village half hid in the recess of the mountain.  Oh, surely the spirit
that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man
than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of
the mountains of our own country." Clerval!  Beloved friend!  Even now
it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which
you are so eminently deserving.  He was a being formed in the "very
poetry of nature." His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened
by the sensibility of his heart.  His soul overflowed with ardent
affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature
that the world-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But
even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind.
The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with
admiration, he loved with ardour:--


     ----The sounding cataract
     Haunted him like a passion:  the tall rock,
     The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
     Their colours and their forms, were then to him
     An appetite; a feeling, and a love,
     That had no need of a remoter charm,
     By thought supplied, or any interest
     Unborrow'd from the eye.

                    [Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey".]


And where does he now exist?  Is this gentle and lovely being lost
forever?  Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful
and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the
life of its creator;--has this mind perished?  Does it now only exist
in my memory?  No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and
consoles your unhappy friend.

Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight
tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,
overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.  I will
proceed with my tale.

Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved
to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the
stream of the river was too gentle to aid us.  Our journey here lost
the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few
days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.  It was on a
clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the
white cliffs of Britain.  The banks of the Thames presented a new
scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by
the remembrance of some story.  We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the
Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich--places which I had
heard of even in my country.

At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's towering
above all, and the Tower famed in English history.



Chapter 19

London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several
months in this wonderful and celebrated city.  Clerval desired the
intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this
time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally
occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of
introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most
distinguished natural philosophers.

If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,
it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.  But a blight had
come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of
the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest
was so terribly profound.  Company was irksome to me; when alone, I
could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of
Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory
peace.  But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to
my heart.  I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my
fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and
Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled
my soul with anguish.

But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive
and anxious to gain experience and instruction.  The difference of
manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
instruction and amusement.  He was also pursuing an object he had long
had in view.  His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had
in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had
taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of
European colonization and trade.  In Britain only could he further the
execution of his plan.  He was forever busy, and the only check to his
enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.  I tried to conceal this
as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures
natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by
any care or bitter recollection.  I often refused to accompany him,
alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.  I now also
began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this
was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling
on the head.  Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme
anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.

After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person
in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.  He mentioned
the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not
sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north
as Perth, where he resided.  Clerval eagerly desired to accept this
invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again
mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature
adorns her chosen dwelling-places.  We had arrived in England at the
beginning of October, and it was now February.  We accordingly
determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration
of another month.  In this expedition we did not intend to follow the
great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the
Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour
about the end of July.  I packed up my chemical instruments and the
materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some
obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.

We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at
Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.  This was a new scene to us
mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of
stately deer were all novelties to us.

From thence we proceeded to Oxford.  As we entered this city our minds
were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
there more than a century and a half before.  It was here that Charles
I. had collected his forces.  This city had remained faithful to him,
after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of
Parliament and liberty.  The memory of that unfortunate king and his
companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and
son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they
might be supposed to have inhabited.  The spirit of elder days found a
dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.  If these
feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of
the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.
The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows
of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,
which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and
domes, embosomed among aged trees.

I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.  I was formed
for peaceful happiness.  During my youthful days discontent never
visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what
is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in
the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate
elasticity to my spirits.  But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has
entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what
I shall soon cease to be--a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,
pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.

We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs
and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most
animating epoch of English history.  Our little voyages of discovery
were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented
themselves.  We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the
field on which that patriot fell.  For a moment my soul was elevated
from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas
of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments
and the remembrancers.  For an instant I dared to shake off my chains
and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten
into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my
miserable self.

We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next
place of rest.  The country in the neighbourhood of this village
resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but
everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of
distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my
native country.  We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets
of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same
manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.  The latter name
made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit
Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.

From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in
Cumberland and Westmorland.  I could now almost fancy myself among the
Swiss mountains.  The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the
northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.  Here also we
made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into
happiness.  The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than
mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found
in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have
imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his
inferiors.  "I could pass my life here," said he to me; "and among
these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine."

But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain
amidst its enjoyments.  His feelings are forever on the stretch; and
when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit
that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again
engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.

We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland
and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period
of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them
to travel on.  For my own part I was not sorry.  I had now neglected my
promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the daemon's
disappointment.  He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance
on my relatives.  This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment
from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.  I waited
for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was
miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I
saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to
read and ascertain my fate.  Sometimes I thought that the fiend
followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,
but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of
his destroyer.  I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the
consciousness of which haunted me.  I was guiltless, but I had indeed
drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.

I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
have interested the most unfortunate being.  Clerval did not like it so
well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing
to him.  But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh,
its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world,
Arthur's Seat, St. Bernard's Well, and the Pentland Hills compensated
him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But
I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.

We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew's, and
along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.
But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into
their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and
accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland
alone.  "Do you," said I, "enjoy yourself, and let this be our
rendezvous.  I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with
my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short
time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more
congenial to your own temper."

Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to
remonstrate.  He entreated me to write often.  "I had rather be with
you," he said, "in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch
people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear  friend, to return,
that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in
your absence."

Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of
Scotland and finish my work in solitude.  I did not doubt but that the
monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have
finished, that he might receive his companion.  With this resolution I
traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of
the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.  It was a place fitted for such
a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually
beaten upon by the waves.  The soil was barren, scarcely affording
pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants,
which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave
tokens of their miserable fare.  Vegetables and bread, when they
indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured
from the mainland, which was about five miles distant.

On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of
these was vacant when I arrived.  This I hired.  It contained but two
rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable
penury.  The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the
door was off its hinges.  I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have
occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been
benumbed by want and squalid poverty.  As it was, I lived ungazed at
and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes
which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations
of men.

In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to
listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.  It was a
monotonous yet ever-changing scene.  I thought of Switzerland; it was
far different from this desolate and appalling landscape.  Its hills
are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the
plains.  Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when
troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively
infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.

In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but
as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and
irksome to me.  Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my
laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night
in order to complete my work.  It was, indeed, a filthy process in
which I was engaged.  During my first experiment, a kind of
enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my
mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes
were shut to the horror of my proceedings.  But now I went to it in
cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.

Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in
a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from
the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I
grew restless and nervous.  Every moment I feared to meet my
persecutor.  Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing
to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much
dreaded to behold.  I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow
creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.

In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably
advanced.  I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager
hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was
intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken
in my bosom.



Chapter 20

I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was
just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment,
and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should
leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an
unremitting attention to it.  As I sat, a train of reflection occurred
to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.
Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a
fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it
forever with the bitterest remorse.  I was now about to form another
being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten
thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own
sake, in murder and wretchedness.  He had sworn to quit the
neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and
she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning
animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation.
They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed
his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for
it when it came before his eyes in the female form?  She also might
turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might
quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation
of being deserted by one of his own species.  Even if they were to
leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the
first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would
be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth
who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition
precarious and full of terror.  Had I right, for my own benefit, to
inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?  I had before been
moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck
senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the
wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that
future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not
hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence
of the whole human race.

I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by
the light of the moon the daemon at the casement.  A ghastly grin
wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task
which he had allotted to me.  Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he
had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the
fulfilment of my promise.

As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of
malice and treachery.  I thought with a sensation of madness on my
promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,
tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.  The wretch saw me
destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for
happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.

I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own
heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I
sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate
the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most
terrible reveries.

Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;
it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature
reposed under the eye of the quiet moon.  A few fishing vessels alone
specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound
of voices as the fishermen called to one another.  I felt the silence,
although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear
was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a
person landed close to my house.

In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one
endeavoured to open it softly.  I trembled from head to foot; I felt a
presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who
dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the
sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you
in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to
the spot. Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage;
the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.

Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice, "You
have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend?
Do you dare to break your promise?  I have endured toil and misery; I
left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among
its willow islands and over the summits of its hills.  I have dwelt
many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland.
I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare
destroy my hopes?"

"Begone!  I do break my promise; never will I create another like
yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness."

"Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself
unworthy of my condescension.  Remember that I have power; you believe
yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of
day will be hateful to you.  You are my creator, but I am your master;
obey!"

"The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is
arrived.  Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but
they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in
vice.  Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose
delight is in death and wretchedness?  Begone!  I am firm, and your
words will only exasperate my rage."

The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in
the impotence of anger.  "Shall each man," cried he, "find a wife for
his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?  I had
feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.
Man!  You may hate, but beware!  Your hours will pass in dread and
misery, and soon the bolt  will fall which must ravish from you your
happiness forever.  Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity
of my wretchedness?  You can blast my other passions, but revenge
remains--revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food!  I may die, but
first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on
your misery.  Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.  I will
watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.
Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict."

"Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.
I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend
beneath words.  Leave me; I am inexorable."

"It is well.  I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your
wedding-night."

I started forward and exclaimed, "Villain!  Before you sign my
death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe."

I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with
precipitation.  In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot
across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the
waves.

All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears.  I burned with
rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the
ocean.  I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my
imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.  Why
had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?  But I had
suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the
mainland.  I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed
to his insatiate revenge.  And then I thought again of his words--"I
WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT."  That, then, was the period
fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny.  In that hour I should die and
at once satisfy and extinguish his malice.  The prospect did not move
me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears
and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously
snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months,
streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy
without a bitter struggle.

The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings
became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage
sinks into the depths of despair.  I left the house, the horrid scene
of the last night's contention, and walked on the beach of the sea,
which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my
fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole
across me.

I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is
true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.  If I returned,
it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the
grasp of a daemon whom I had myself created.

I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it
loved and miserable in the separation.  When it became noon, and the
sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep
sleep.  I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves
were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.  The sleep
into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as
if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to
reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the
words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared
like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.

The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my
appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a
fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;
it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to
join him.  He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where
he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired
his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his
Indian enterprise.  He could not any longer delay his departure; but as
his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now
conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of
my society on him as I could spare.  He besought me, therefore, to
leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed
southwards together.  This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and
I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.  Yet,
before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to
reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I
must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I
must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The
next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked
the door of my laboratory.  The remains of the half-finished creature,
whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as
if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.  I paused to
collect myself and then entered the chamber.  With trembling hand I
conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought
not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion
of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great
quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into
the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach,
employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.

Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place
in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the daemon.  I had
before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with
whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film
had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw
clearly.  The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur
to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not
reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.  I had resolved in
my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made
would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I
banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different
conclusion.

Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting
my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the
shore.  The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning
towards land, but I sailed away from them.  I felt as if I was about
the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety
any encounter with my fellow creatures.  At one time the moon, which
had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I
took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the
sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away
from the spot.  The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although
chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising.  But it refreshed
me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to
prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct
position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.  Clouds hid the
moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as
its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short
time I slept soundly. I do not know how long I remained in this
situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted
considerably.  The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened
the safety of my little skiff.  I found that the wind was northeast and
must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked.  I
endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made
the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water.  Thus
situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind.  I confess
that I felt a few sensations of terror.  I had no compass with me and
was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the
world that the sun was of little benefit to me.  I might be driven into
the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be
swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around
me.  I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a
burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings.  I looked on the
heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only
to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave.
"Fiend," I exclaimed, "your task is already fulfilled!"  I thought of
Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval--all left behind, on whom the
monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions.  This idea
plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now,
when the scene is on the point of closing before me forever, I shudder
to reflect on it.

Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the
horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became
free from breakers.  But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick
and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high
land towards the south.

Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured
for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of
warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.

How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we
have of life even in the excess of misery!  I constructed another sail
with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.
It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily
perceived the traces of cultivation.  I saw vessels near the shore and
found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of
civilized man.  I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed
a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.
As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly
towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure
nourishment.  Fortunately I had money with me.

As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good
harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected
escape.

As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several
people crowded towards the spot.  They seemed much surprised at my
appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered
together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me
a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they
spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.  "My
good friends," said I, "will you be so kind as to tell me the name of
this town and inform me where I am?"

"You will know that soon enough," replied a man with a hoarse voice.
"Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,
but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you."

I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a
stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and
angry countenances of his companions.  "Why do you answer me so
roughly?"  I replied.  "Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to
receive strangers so inhospitably."

"I do not know," said the man, "what the custom of the English may be,
but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains." While this strange
dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.  Their
faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed  and in
some degree alarmed me.

I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied.  I then moved
forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed
and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the
shoulder and said, "Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin's to
give an account of yourself."

"Who is Mr. Kirwin?  Why am I to give an account of myself?  Is not
this a free country?"

"Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.  Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,
and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was
found murdered here last night."

This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself.  I was
innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my
conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town.
I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a
crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical
debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt.
Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to
overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy
or death. I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall
the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in
proper detail, to my recollection.



Chapter 21

I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old
benevolent man with calm and mild manners.  He looked upon me, however,
with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,
he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.

About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the
magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before
with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten
o'clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they
accordingly put in for port.  It was a very dark night, as the moon had
not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been
accustomed, at a creek about two miles below.  He walked on first,
carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him
at some distance.

As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against
something and fell at his length on the ground. His companions came up
to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had
fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.  Their
first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had
been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination
they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not
then cold.  They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman
near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life.  It
appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of
age.  He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any
violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.

The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but
when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of
my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a
mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for
support.  The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew
an unfavourable augury from my manner.

The son confirmed his father's account, but when Daniel Nugent was
called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion,
he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the
shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was
the same boat in which I had just landed.  A woman deposed that she
lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage,
waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard
of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in
it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards
found.

Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the
body into her house; it was not cold.  They put it into a bed and
rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was
quite gone.

Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed
that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it
was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been
obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.
Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body
from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know
the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance
of the town of ---- from the place where I had deposited the corpse.

Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken
into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be
observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me.  This idea
was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when
the mode of the murder had been described.  I was accordingly
conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn.  I
could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken
place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been
conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the
time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the
consequences of the affair.  I entered the room where the corpse lay
and was led up to the coffin.  How can I describe my sensations on
beholding it?  I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on
that terrible moment without shuddering and agony.  The examination,
the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from
my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched
before me.  I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I
exclaimed, "Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my
dearest Henry, of life?  Two I have already destroyed; other victims
await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor--"

The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and
I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.  A fever succeeded
to this.  I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I
afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of
William, of Justine, and of Clerval.  Sometimes I entreated my
attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was
tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already
grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror.
Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood
me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the
other witnesses.  Why did I not die?  More miserable than man ever was
before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?  Death snatches
away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents;
how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of
health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the
tomb!  Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many
shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the
torture?

But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from
a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by
jailers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.
It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had
forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some
great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around
and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I
was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.

This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside
me.  She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her
countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize
that class.  The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of
persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of misery. Her
tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,
and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.
"Are you better now, sir?" said she.

I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, "I believe I am;
but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am
still alive to feel this misery and horror."

"For that matter," replied the old woman, "if you mean about the
gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you
were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!  However, that's none
of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty
with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same."

I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a
speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt
languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.  The whole series
of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it
were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force
of reality.

As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew
feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed
me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.  The
physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared
them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the
expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the
second.  Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the
hangman who would gain his fee?

These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had
shown me extreme kindness.  He had caused the best room in the prison
to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who
had provided a physician and a nurse.  It is true, he seldom came to
see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of
every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
miserable ravings of a murderer.  He came, therefore, sometimes to see
that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long
intervals.  One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in
a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death.  I
was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek
death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with
wretchedness.  At one time I considered whether I should not declare
myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than
poor Justine had been.  Such were my thoughts when the door of my
apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.  His countenance expressed
sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me
in French, "I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do
anything to make you more comfortable?"

"I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole
earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving."

"I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to
one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.  But you will, I
hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can
easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge."

"That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become
the most miserable of mortals.  Persecuted and tortured as I am and
have been, can death be any evil to me?"

"Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the
strange chances that have lately occurred.  You were thrown, by some
surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,
seized immediately, and charged with murder.  The first sight that was
presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so
unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across
your path."

As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on
this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at
the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.  I suppose some
astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened
to say, "Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that
were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might
discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account
of your misfortune and illness. I found several letters, and, among
others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your
father.  I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed
since the departure of my letter.  But you are ill; even now you
tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind."

"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;
tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am
now to lament?"

"Your family is perfectly well," said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; "and
someone, a friend, is come to visit you."

I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it
instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my
misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for
me to comply with his hellish desires.  I put my hand before my eyes,
and cried out in agony, "Oh! Take him away!  I cannot see him; for
God's sake, do not let him enter!"

Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.  He could not help
regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in
rather a severe tone, "I should have thought, young man, that the
presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring
such violent repugnance."

"My father!" cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed
from anguish to pleasure.  "Is my father indeed come?  How kind, how
very kind!  But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?"

My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he
thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,
and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.  He rose and
quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.

Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the
arrival of my father.  I stretched out my hand to him and cried, "Are
you, then, safe--and Elizabeth--and Ernest?" My father calmed me with
assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these
subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits;
but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.

"What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!" said he, looking
mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room.
"You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you.
And poor Clerval--"

The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too
great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.  "Alas!  Yes, my
father," replied I; "some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over
me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the
coffin of Henry."

We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the
precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that
could ensure tranquillity.  Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my
strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.  But the
appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I
gradually recovered my health.

As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black
melancholy that nothing could dissipate.  The image of Clerval was
forever before me, ghastly and murdered.  More than once the agitation
into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous
relapse.  Alas!  Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a
life?  It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now
drawing to a close.  Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these
throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears
me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also
sink to rest.  Then the appearance of death was distant, although the
wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours
motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that
might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.

The season of the assizes approached.  I had already been three months
in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a
relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country
town where the court was held.  Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every
care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.  I was spared
the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not
brought before the court that decides on life and death.  The grand
jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney
Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight
after my removal I was liberated from prison.

My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a
criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh
atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.  I did not
participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a
palace were alike hateful.  The cup of life was poisoned forever, and
although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I
saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by
no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.  Sometimes
they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark
orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed
them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I
first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.

My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.  He talked
of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but
these words only drew deep groans from me.  Sometimes, indeed, I felt a
wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved
cousin or longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once more
the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early
childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a
prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and
these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and
despair.  At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the
existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance
to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.

Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally
triumphed over my selfish despair.  It was necessary that I should
return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those
I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any
chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to
blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to
the existence of the monstrous image which  I had endued with the
mockery of a soul still more monstrous.  My father still desired to
delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a
journey, for I was a shattered wreck--the shadow of a human being.  My
strength was gone.  I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day
preyed upon my wasted frame.  Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland
with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to
yield.  We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace
and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.  It was midnight.  I
lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of
the waves.  I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and
my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon
see Geneva.  The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;
yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested
shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly
that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and
dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my
creation.  I repassed, in my memory, my whole life--my quiet happiness
while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my
departure for Ingolstadt.  I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm
that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to
mind the night in which he first lived.  I was unable to pursue the
train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept
bitterly.  Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the
custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was
by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest
necessary for the preservation of life.  Oppressed by the recollection
of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and
soon slept profoundly.  But sleep did not afford me respite from
thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared
me.  Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the
fiend's grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and
cries rang in my ears.  My father, who was watching over me, perceiving
my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy
sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that
a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible,
disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which
the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.



Chapter 22

The voyage came to an end.  We landed, and proceeded to Paris.  I soon
found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I
could continue my journey.  My father's care and attentions were
indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and
sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.  He wished me to
seek amusement in society.  I abhorred the face of man.  Oh, not
abhorred!  They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt
attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an
angelic nature and celestial mechanism.  But I felt that I had no right
to share their intercourse.  I had unchained an enemy among them whose
joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.  How they
would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know
my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!

My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by
various arguments to banish my despair.  Sometimes he thought that I
felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of
murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.

"Alas!  My father," said I, "how little do you know me.  Human beings,
their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch
as I felt pride.  Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I,
and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause
of this--I murdered her.  William, Justine, and Henry--they all died by
my hands."

My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same
assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an
explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring
of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had
presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I
preserved in my convalescence.

I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the
wretch I had created.  I had a persuasion that I should be supposed
mad, and this in itself would forever have chained my tongue.  But,
besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill
my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the
inmates of his breast.  I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for
sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have
confided the fatal secret.  Yet, still, words like those I have
recorded would burst uncontrollably from me.  I could offer no
explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my
mysterious woe.  Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression
of unbounded wonder, "My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?  My
dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again."

"I am not mad," I cried energetically; "the sun and the heavens, who
have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.  I am the
assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.
A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have
saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
sacrifice the whole human race."

The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were
deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and
endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.  He wished as much as
possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in
Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my
misfortunes.

As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my
heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own
crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.  By the utmost
self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which
sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners
were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey
to the sea of ice.  A few days before we left Paris on our way to
Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth:


"My dear Friend,

"It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle
dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may
hope to see you in less than a fortnight.  My poor cousin, how much you
must have suffered!  I expect to see you looking even more ill than
when you quitted Geneva.  This winter has been passed most miserably,
tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in
your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of
comfort and tranquillity.

"Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable
a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.  I would not disturb you at
this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a
conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders
some explanation necessary before we meet.   Explanation!  You may
possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain?  If you really say
this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.  But you
are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be
pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the
case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence,
I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to
begin.

"You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of
your parents ever since our infancy.  We were told this when young, and
taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
place.  We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I
believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But
as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each
other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our
case?  Tell me, dearest Victor.  Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual
happiness, with simple truth--Do you not love another?

"You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at
Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last
autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every
creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our
connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of
your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.
But this is false reasoning.  I confess to you, my friend, that I love
you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant
friend and companion.   But it is your happiness I desire as well as my
own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally
miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.  Even now
I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest
misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word 'honour,' all hope of that
love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself.  I, who
have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries
tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.  Ah! Victor, be assured
that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be
made miserable by this supposition.  Be happy, my friend; and if you
obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth
will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.

"Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the
next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.  My uncle
will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your
lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I
shall need no other happiness.

                                                "Elizabeth Lavenza


    "Geneva, May 18th, 17--"


This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the
threat of the fiend--"I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT!" Such
was my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to
destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised
partly to console my sufferings.  On that night he had determined to
consummate his crimes by my death.  Well, be it so; a deadly struggle
would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I
should be at peace and his power over me be at an end.  If he were
vanquished, I should be a free man.  Alas!  What freedom?  Such as the
peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his
cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,
penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in
my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of
remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.

Sweet and beloved Elizabeth!  I read and reread her letter, and some
softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal
dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the
angel's arm bared to drive me from all hope.  Yet I would die to make
her happy.  If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable;
yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.  My
destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer
should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would
surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.

He had vowed TO BE WITH ME ON MY WEDDING-NIGHT, yet he did not consider
that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show
me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval
immediately after the enunciation of his threats.  I resolved,
therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce
either to hers or my father's happiness, my adversary's designs against
my life should not retard it a single hour.

In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.  My letter was calm and
affectionate.  "I fear, my beloved girl," I said, "little happiness
remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in
you.  Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life
and my endeavours for contentment.  I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with
horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only
wonder that I survive what I have endured.  I will confide this tale of
misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,
for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.  But
until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.  This I most
earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply."

In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth's letter we returned to
Geneva.  The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were
in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish  cheeks.  I
saw a change in her also.  She was thinner and had lost much of that
heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and
soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted
and miserable as I was.  The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not
endure.  Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had
passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt
with rage, sometimes low and despondent.  I neither spoke nor looked at
anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries
that overcame me.

Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle
voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with
human feelings when sunk in torpor.  She wept with me and for me.  When
reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with
resignation.  Ah!  It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but
for the guilty there is no peace.  The agonies of remorse poison the
luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of
grief.  Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage
with Elizabeth.  I remained silent.

"Have you, then, some other attachment?"

"None on earth.  I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with
delight.  Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate
myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin."

"My dear Victor, do not speak thus.  Heavy misfortunes have befallen
us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love
for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.  Our circle will be
small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.
And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of
care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly
deprived."

Such were the lessons of my father.  But to me the remembrance of the
threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had
yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as
invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words "I SHALL BE WITH
YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT," I should regard the threatened fate as
unavoidable.  But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were
balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful
countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the
ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,
the seal to my fate.

Great God!  If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish
intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself
forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over
the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.  But, as if
possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real
intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I
hastened that of a far dearer victim.

As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from
cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.  But
I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought
smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the
ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.  She looked forward to our
union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which
past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and
tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no
trace but deep and everlasting regret.  Preparations were made for the
event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling
appearance.  I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety
that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans
of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my
tragedy.  Through my father's exertions a part of the inheritance of
Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government.  A small
possession on the shores of Como belonged to her.  It was agreed that,
immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and
spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which
it stood.

In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the
fiend should openly attack me.  I carried pistols and a dagger
constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and
by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.  Indeed, as the
period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be
regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for
in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed
for its solemnization drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of
as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.

Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to
calm her mind.  But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my
destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;
and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had
promised to reveal to her on the following day.  My father was in the
meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in
the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.

After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my
father's, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our
journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our
voyage on the following day.  The day was fair, the wind favourable;
all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.

Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the
feeling of happiness.  We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we
were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the
beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw
Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance,
surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy
mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the
opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the
ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost
insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.

I took the hand of Elizabeth.  "You are sorrowful, my love.  Ah!  If
you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would
endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this
one day at least permits me to enjoy."

"Be happy, my dear Victor," replied Elizabeth; "there is, I hope,
nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not
painted in my face, my heart is contented.  Something whispers to me
not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I
will not listen to such a sinister voice.  Observe how fast we move
along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise
above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more
interesting.  Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in
the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at
the bottom.  What a divine day!  How happy and serene all nature
appears!"

Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all
reflection upon melancholy subjects.  But her temper was fluctuating;
joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place
to distraction and reverie.

The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and
observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the
lower hills.  The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached
the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.  The
spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range
of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.

The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,
sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water
and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the
shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and
hay.  The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched
the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp
me and cling to me forever.



Chapter 23

It was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the
shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and
contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured
in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.

The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence
in the west.  The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was
beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the
flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the
scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves
that were beginning to rise.  Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.

I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the
shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.  I was anxious
and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in
my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my
life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that
of my adversary was extinguished.  Elizabeth observed my agitation for
some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my
glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked,
"What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?  What is it you fear?"

"Oh!  Peace, peace, my love," replied I; "this night, and all will be
safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful."

I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how
fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,
and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her
until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.

She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages
of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to
my adversary.  But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to
conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the
execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful
scream.  It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.  As I
heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the
motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood
trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This
state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed
into the room.  Great God!  Why did I not then expire!  Why am I here
to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on
earth?  She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed,
her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered
by her hair.  Everywhere I turn I see the same figure--her bloodless
arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier.  Could
I behold this and live?  Alas!  Life is obstinate and clings closest
where it is most hated.  For a moment only did I lose recollection; I
fell senseless on the ground.

When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn;
their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of
others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that
oppressed me.  I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of
Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.  She
had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and
now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across
her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards
her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness
of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be
the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.  The murderous mark of
the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue
from her lips.  While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I
happened to look up.  The windows of the room had before been darkened,
and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon
illuminate the chamber.  The shutters had been thrown back, and with a
sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a
figure the most hideous and abhorred.  A grin was on the face of the
monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed
towards the corpse of my wife.  I rushed towards the window, and
drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from
his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into
the lake.

The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to
the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with
boats; nets were cast, but in vain.  After passing several hours, we
returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a
form conjured up by my fancy.  After having landed, they proceeded to
search the country, parties going in different directions among the
woods and vines.

I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the
house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken
man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my
eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.  In this state I
was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had
happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that
I had lost.

After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room
where the corpse of my beloved lay.  There were women weeping around; I
hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no
distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to
various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their
cause.  I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.  The death
of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly
of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining
friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now
might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his
feet.  This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.  I started
up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.

There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but
the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.  However, it
was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night.  I
hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced
relief from mental torment in bodily exercise.  But the overflowing
misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered
me incapable of any exertion.  I threw down the oar, and leaning my
head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose.  If I
looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time
and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her
who was now but a shadow and a recollection.  Tears streamed from my
eyes.  The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the
waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed
by Elizabeth.  Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and
sudden change.  The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but
nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before.  A fiend had
snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever
been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the
history of man. But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed
this last overwhelming event?  Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have
reached their acme, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to
you.  Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left
desolate.  My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few
words, what remains of my hideous narration. I arrived at Geneva.  My
father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that
I bore.  I see him now, excellent and venerable old man!  His eyes
wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their
delight--his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with
all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life,
having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.
Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and
doomed him to waste in wretchedness!  He could not live under the
horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence
suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few
days he died in my arms.

What then became of me?  I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and
darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.  Sometimes,
indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales
with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a
dungeon.  Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear
conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my
prison.  For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I
understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.

Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I
awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.  As the
memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their
cause--the monster whom I had created, the miserable daemon whom I had
sent abroad into the world for my destruction.  I was possessed by a
maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed
that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal
revenge on his cursed head.

Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to
reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about
a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town
and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the
destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole
authority for the apprehension of the murderer.  The magistrate
listened to me with attention and kindness.

"Be assured, sir," said he, "no pains or exertions on my part shall be
spared to discover the villain."

"I thank you," replied I; "listen, therefore, to the deposition that I
have to make.  It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you
would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however
wonderful, forces conviction.  The story is too connected to be
mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood." My manner as
I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own
heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose
quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life.  I now
related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the
dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.

The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I
continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes
shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with
disbelief, was painted on his countenance.  When I had concluded my
narration I said, "This is the being whom I accuse and for whose
seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power.  It
is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings
as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this
occasion."  This address caused a considerable change in the
physiognomy of my own auditor.  He had heard my story with that half
kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural
events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence,
the whole tide of his incredulity returned.  He, however, answered
mildly, "I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but
the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put
all my exertions to defiance.  Who can follow an animal which can
traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would
venture to intrude?  Besides, some months have elapsed since the
commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he
has wandered or what region he may now inhabit."

"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he
has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois
and destroyed as a beast of prey.  But I perceive your thoughts; you do
not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the
punishment which is his desert." As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes;
the magistrate was intimidated.  "You are mistaken," said he.  "I will
exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured
that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes.  But I
fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that
this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is
pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment."

"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.  My
revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I
confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.  My rage
is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned
loose upon society, still exists.  You refuse my just demand; I have
but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to
his destruction."

I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy
in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness
which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.  But to a Genevan
magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of
devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of
madness.  He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and
reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.

"Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!  Cease;
you know not what it is you say."

I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on
some other mode of action.



Chapter 24

My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was
swallowed up and lost.  I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone
endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and
allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise
delirium or death would have been my portion.

My first resolution was to quit Geneva forever; my country, which, when
I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became
hateful.  I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few
jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.  And now my
wanderings began which are to cease but with life.  I have traversed a
vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which
travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet.  How I
have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs
upon the sandy plain and prayed for death.  But revenge kept me alive;
I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.

When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I
might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.  But my plan was unsettled,
and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain
what path I should pursue.  As night approached I found myself at the
entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father
reposed.  I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their
graves.  Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which
were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the
scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested
observer.  The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to
cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the
mourner.

The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way
to rage and despair.  They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also
lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.  I knelt
on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed,
"By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near
me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O
Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the daemon who
caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict.  For
this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will
I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which
otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever.  And I call on you,
spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to
aid and conduct me in my work.  Let the cursed and hellish monster
drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me."  I
had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured
me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my
devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked
my utterance.

I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish
laugh.  It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed
it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.
Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have
destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I
was reserved for vengeance.  The laughter died away, when a well-known
and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an
audible whisper, "I am satisfied, miserable wretch!  You have
determined to live, and I am satisfied."

I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil
eluded my grasp.  Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone
full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than
mortal speed.

I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.  Guided by a
slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.  The
blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend
enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.  I
took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.

Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I
have ever followed in his track.  Sometimes the peasants, scared by
this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,
who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,
left some mark to guide me.  The snows descended on my head, and I saw
the print of his huge step on the white plain.  To you first entering
on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand
what I have felt and still feel?  Cold, want, and fatigue were the
least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil
and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good
followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly
extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.  Sometimes,
when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast
was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.  The
fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but
I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had
invoked to aid me.  Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and
I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the
few drops that revived me, and vanish.

I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the daemon
generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the
country chiefly collected.  In other places human beings were seldom
seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my
path.  I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers
by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,
which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had
provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.

My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during
sleep alone that I could taste joy.  O blessed sleep!  Often, when most
miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.
The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather
hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my
pilgrimage.  Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my
hardships.  During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope
of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved
country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the
silver tones of my Elizabeth's voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying
health and youth.  Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded
myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should
then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends.  What agonizing
fondness did I feel for them!  How did I cling to their dear forms, as
sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that
they still lived!  At such moments vengeance, that burned within me,
died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the
daemon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of
some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my
soul.  What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.  Sometimes,
indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in
stone that guided me and instigated my fury.  "My reign is not yet
over"--these words were legible in one of these inscriptions--"you
live, and my power is complete.  Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices
of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to
which I am impassive.  You will find near this place, if you follow not
too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.  Come on, my enemy; we
have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours
must you endure until that period shall arrive."

Scoffing devil!  Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,
miserable fiend, to torture and death.  Never will I give up my search
until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my
Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the
reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!

As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and
the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support.  The
peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy
ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from
their hiding-places to seek for prey.  The rivers were covered with
ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my
chief article of maintenance.  The triumph of my enemy increased with
the difficulty of my labours.  One inscription that he left was in
these words:  "Prepare!  Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs
and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your
sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred."

My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I
resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support
me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,
until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary
of the horizon.  Oh!  How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the
south!  Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by
its superior wildness and ruggedness.  The Greeks wept for joy when
they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with
rapture the boundary of their toils.  I did not weep, but I knelt down
and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in
safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary's gibe,
to meet and grapple with him.

Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus
traversed the snows with inconceivable speed.  I know not whether the
fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had
daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that
when I first saw the ocean he was but one day's journey in advance, and
I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.  With new
courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched
hamlet on the seashore.  I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the
fiend and gained accurate information.  A gigantic monster, they said,
had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,
putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of
his terrific appearance.  He had carried off their store of winter
food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a
numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same
night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his
journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they
conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the
ice or frozen by the eternal  frosts.

On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.
He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless
journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few
of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a
genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.  Yet at the idea
that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance
returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.
After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered
round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.
I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of
the frozen ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I
departed from land.

I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured
misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution
burning within my heart could have enabled me to support.  Immense and
rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard
the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.  But
again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.

By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that
I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction
of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of
despondency and grief from my eyes.  Despair had indeed almost secured
her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.  Once, after
the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the
summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,
died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.  I strained my sight to
discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I
distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known
form within.  Oh!  With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!
Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might
not intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was
dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
oppressed me, I wept aloud.

But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their
dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an
hour's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly
irksome to me, I continued my route.  The sledge was still visible, nor
did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short
time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.  I indeed
perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days' journey, I
beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within
me.

But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were
suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I
had ever done before.  A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its
progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every
moment more ominous and terrific.  I pressed on, but in vain.  The wind
arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake,
it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound.  The
work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled
between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece
of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a
hideous death.  In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of
my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of
distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to
me hopes of succour and life.  I had no conception that vessels ever
came so far north and was astounded at the sight.  I quickly destroyed
part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled,
with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your
ship.  I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust
myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose.  I
hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my
enemy.  But your direction was northwards.  You took me on board when
my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my
multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is
unfulfilled.

Oh!  When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the daemon, allow
me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?  If I do,
swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him
and satisfy my vengeance in his death.  And do I dare to ask of you to
undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?
No; I am not so selfish.  Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if
the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he
shall not live--swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated
woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.  He is eloquent
and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but
trust him not.  His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery
and fiend-like malice.  Hear him not; call on the names of William,
Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and
thrust your sword into his heart.  I will hover near and direct the
steel aright.


               Walton, in continuation.



                                                August 26th, 17--


You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not
feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles
mine?  Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his
tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with
difficulty the words so replete with anguish.  His fine and lovely eyes
were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow
and quenched in infinite wretchedness.  Sometimes he commanded his
countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a
tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression
of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.

His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest
truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he
showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship,
brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than
his asseverations, however earnest and connected.  Such a monster has,
then, really existence!  I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise
and admiration.  Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the
particulars of his creature's formation, but on this point he was
impenetrable. "Are you mad, my friend?" said he.  "Or whither does your
senseless curiosity lead you?  Would you also create for yourself and
the world a demoniacal enemy?  Peace, peace!  Learn my miseries and do
not seek to increase your own."  Frankenstein discovered that I made
notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself
corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving
the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. "Since
you have preserved my narration," said he, "I would not that a
mutilated one should go down to posterity."

Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest
tale that ever imagination formed.  My thoughts and every feeling of my
soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale
and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.  I wish to soothe
him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of
every hope of consolation, to live?  Oh, no!  The only joy that he can
now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and
death.  Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and
delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his
friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or
excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his
fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a
remote world.  This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render
them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.

Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and
misfortunes.  On every point of general literature he displays
unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.  His
eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates
a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,
without tears.  What a glorious creature must he have been in the days
of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!  He seems
to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.

"When younger," said he, "I believed myself destined for some great
enterprise.  My feelings are profound, but I possessed a  coolness of
judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements.  This sentiment
of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been
oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief
those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures.  When I
reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation
of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the
herd of common projectors.  But this thought, which supported me in the
commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the
dust.  All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the
archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell.
My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application
were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and
executed the creation of a man.  Even now I cannot recollect without
passion my reveries while the work was incomplete.  I trod heaven in my
thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their
effects.  From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
ambition; but how am I sunk!  Oh!  My friend, if you had known me as I
once was, you would not recognize me in this state of degradation.
Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me
on, until I fell, never, never again to rise."  Must I then lose this
admirable being?  I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who
would sympathize with and love me.  Behold, on these desert seas I have
found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value
and lose him.  I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.

"I thank you, Walton," he said, "for your kind intentions towards so
miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh
affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?  Can any
man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth?  Even
where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,
the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our
minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.  They know our
infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,
are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more
certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.  A sister or a
brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,
suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,
however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be
contemplated with suspicion.  But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever
I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of
Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one
feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life.  If I
were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive
utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.  But
such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I
gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die."




September 2nd

My beloved Sister,

I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever
doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit
it.  I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
threaten every moment to crush my vessel.  The brave fellows whom I
have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have
none to bestow.  There is something terribly appalling in our
situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me.  Yet it is
terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered
through me.  If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.

And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind?  You will not hear
of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return.  Years will
pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by
hope.  Oh!  My beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt
expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death.

But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy.  Heaven
bless you and make you so!

My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.  He
endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession
which he valued.  He reminds me how often the same accidents have
happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite
of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries.  Even the sailors feel
the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he
rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these
vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the
resolutions of man.  These feelings are transitory; each day of
expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny
caused by this despair.



September 5th


A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is
highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot
forbear recording it.

We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger
of being crushed in their conflict.  The cold is excessive, and many of
my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of
desolation.  Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire
still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly
roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent
lifelessness.

I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.
This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend--his
eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly--I was roused by half
a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin.  They
entered, and their leader addressed me.  He told me that he and his
companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation
to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.
We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they
feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free
passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and
lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted
this.  They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn
promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my
course southwards.

This speech troubled me.  I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived
the idea of returning if set free.  Yet could I, in justice, or even in
possibility, refuse this demand?  I hesitated before I answered, when
Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly
to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,
and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.  Turning towards the men,
he said, "What do you mean?  What do you demand of your captain?  Are
you, then, so easily turned from your design?  Did you not call this a
glorious expedition?

"And wherefore was it glorious?  Not because the way was smooth and
placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and
terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called
forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded
it, and these you were to brave and overcome.  For this was it a
glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking.  You were
hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names
adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and
the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination of
danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your
courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who
had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls,
they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides.  Why, that
requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and
dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove
yourselves cowards.  Oh!  Be men, or be more than men.  Be steady to
your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as
your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say
that it shall not.  Do not return to your families with the stigma of
disgrace marked on your brows.  Return as heroes who have fought and
conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe."
He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings
expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and
heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?  They looked at
one another and were unable to reply.  I spoke; I told them to retire
and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther
north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that,
with reflection, their courage would return.  They retired and I turned
towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of
life.

How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than
return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled.  Yet I fear such will be my
fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never
willingly continue to endure their present hardships.



September 7th


The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.
Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back
ignorant and disappointed.  It requires more philosophy than I possess
to bear this injustice with patience.



September 12th


It is past; I am returning to England.  I have lost my hopes of utility
and glory; I have lost my friend.  But I will endeavour to detail these
bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted
towards England and towards you, I will not despond.

September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were
heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every
direction.  We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only
remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest
whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined
to his bed.  The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force
towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the 11th the
passage towards the south became perfectly free.  When the sailors saw
this and that their return to their native country was apparently
assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and
long-continued.  Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the
cause of the tumult.  "They shout," I said, "because they will soon
return to England."

"Do you, then, really return?"

"Alas!  Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.  I cannot lead them
unwillingly to danger, and I must return."

"Do so, if you will; but I will not.  You may give up your purpose, but
mine is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not.  I am weak, but
surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with
sufficient strength."  Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the
bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.

It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was
entirely extinct.  At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with
difficulty and was unable to speak.  The surgeon gave him a composing
draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he
told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.

His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient.  I
sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he
slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me
come near, said, "Alas!  The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that
I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in
being.  Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I
feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed;
but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary.
During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past
conduct; nor do I find it blamable.  In a fit of enthusiastic madness I
created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far
as was in my power, his happiness and well-being.

"This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that.  My
duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my
attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or
misery.  Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to
create a companion for the first creature.  He showed unparalleled
malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted
to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness,
and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end.
Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to
die.  The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed.  When
actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my
unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced
by reason and virtue.

"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil
this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have
little chance of meeting with him.  But the consideration of these
points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I
leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near
approach of death.  I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I
may still be misled by passion.

"That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in
other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the
only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.  The forms of
the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.  Farewell,
Walton!  Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it
be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in
science and discoveries.  Yet why do I say this?  I have myself been
blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed."

His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his
effort, he sank into silence.  About half an hour afterwards he
attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and
his eyes closed forever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed
away from his lips.

Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this
glorious spirit?  What can I say that will enable you to understand the
depth of my sorrow?  All that I should express would be inadequate and
feeble.  My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
disappointment.  But I journey towards England, and I may there find
consolation.

I am interrupted.  What do these sounds portend?  It is midnight; the
breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.  Again there
is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin
where the remains of Frankenstein still lie.  I must arise and examine.
Good night, my sister.

Great God! what a scene has just taken place!  I am yet dizzy with the
remembrance of it.  I hardly know whether I shall have the power to
detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete
without this final and wonderful catastrophe. I entered the cabin where
lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend.  Over him hung a
form which I cannot find words to describe--gigantic in stature, yet
uncouth and distorted in its proportions.  As he hung over the coffin,
his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand
was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When
he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of
grief and horror and sprung towards the window.  Never did I behold a
vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling
hideousness.  I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect
what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.  I called on him to
stay.

He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the
lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and
every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some
uncontrollable passion.

"That is also my victim!" he exclaimed.  "In his murder my crimes are
consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close!
Oh, Frankenstein!  Generous and self-devoted being!  What does it avail
that I now ask thee to pardon me?  I, who irretrievably destroyed thee
by destroying all thou lovedst.  Alas!  He is cold, he cannot answer
me." His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had
suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in
destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and
compassion.  I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again
raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly
in his ugliness.  I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my
lips.  The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent
self-reproaches.  At length I gathered resolution to address him in a
pause of the tempest of his passion.

"Your repentance," I said, "is now superfluous. If you had listened to
the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had
urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would
yet have lived."

"And do you dream?" said the daemon.  "Do you think that I was then
dead to agony and remorse?  He," he continued, pointing to the corpse,
"he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh!  Not the
ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the
lingering detail of its execution.  A frightful selfishness hurried me
on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.  Think you that the
groans of Clerval were music to my ears?  My heart was fashioned to be
susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice
and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without
torture such as you cannot even imagine.

"After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken
and overcome.  I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I
abhorred myself.  But when I discovered that he, the author at once of
my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for
happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
indulgence of which I was forever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.  I
recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.  I
knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the
slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not
disobey.  Yet when she died!  Nay, then I was not miserable.  I had
cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
despair.  Evil thenceforth became my good.  Urged thus far, I had no
choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly
chosen.  The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable
passion.  And now it is ended; there is my last victim!"

I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I
called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence
and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of
my friend, indignation was rekindled within me.  "Wretch!" I said.  "It
is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have
made.  You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are
consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.  Hypocritical
fiend!  If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object,
again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance.  It is not
pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your
malignity is withdrawn from your power."

"Oh, it is not thus--not thus," interrupted the being.  "Yet such must
be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of
my actions.  Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.  No sympathy
may I ever find.  When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue,
the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being
overflowed, that I wished to be participated.  But now that virtue has
become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into
bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?  I am
content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I
am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.
Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of
enjoyment.  Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my
outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was
capable of unfolding.  I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and
devotion.  But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No
guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to
mine.  When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot
believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled
with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of
goodness.  But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant
devil.  Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates
in his desolation; I am alone.

"You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my
crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them
he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured
wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did
not satisfy my own desires. They were forever ardent and craving; still
I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.  Was there no
injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all
humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his
friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic
who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous
and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an
abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my
blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.

"But it is true that I am a wretch.  I have murdered the lovely and the
helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to
death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.  I
have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of
love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to
that irremediable ruin.

"There he lies, white and cold in death.  You hate me, but your
abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.  I look on the
hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the
imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these
hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts
no more.

"Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief.  My work
is nearly complete.  Neither yours nor any man's death is needed to
consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be
done, but it requires my own.  Do not think that I shall be slow to
perform this sacrifice.  I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which
brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the
globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this
miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious
and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been.  I
shall die.  I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or
be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched.  He is dead who
called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance
of us both will speedily vanish.  I shall no longer see the sun or
stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks.

"Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I
find my happiness.  Some years ago, when the images which this world
affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer
and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and
these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only
consolation.  Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse,
where can I find rest but in death?

"Farewell!  I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these
eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive
and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better
satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou
didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;
and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think
and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than
that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my
wounds until death shall close them forever.

"But soon," he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, "I shall die, and
what I now feel be no longer felt.  Soon these burning miseries will be
extinct.  I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the
agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will
fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds.  My spirit
will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.
Farewell."

He sprang from the cabin window as he said this, upon the ice raft
which lay close to the vessel.  He was soon borne away by the waves and
lost in darkness and distance.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

I. The Period


It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven,
we were all going direct the other way--
in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
that things in general were settled for ever.

It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally
deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the
earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
brood.

France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her
Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue
torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty
yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and
Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,
already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into
boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were
sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with
rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which
the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of
the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about
with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.

In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
their furniture to upholsterers\xE2\x80\x99 warehouses for security; the highwayman
in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
\xE2\x80\x9Cthe Captain,\xE2\x80\x9D gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
then got shot dead himself by the other four, \xE2\x80\x9Cin consequence of the
failure of his ammunition:\xE2\x80\x9D after which the mail was robbed in peace;
that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London
gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law
fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;
thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles\xE2\x80\x99s, to search
for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the
musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences
much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer\xE2\x80\x99s boy of
sixpence.

All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,
those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the
fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small
creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the
roads that lay before them.




II. The Mail


It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.
The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up
Shooter\xE2\x80\x99s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,
as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish
for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,
and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the
horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the
coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back
to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in
combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals
are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to
their duty.

With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through
the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were
falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested
them and brought them to a stand, with a wary \xE2\x80\x9CWo-ho! so-ho-then!\xE2\x80\x9D the
near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an
unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the
hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a
nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.

There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding
none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the
air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the
waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out
everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,
and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
into it, as if they had made it all.

Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the
side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from
anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was
hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from
the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers
were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on
the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,
when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in
\xE2\x80\x9Cthe Captain\xE2\x80\x99s\xE2\x80\x9D pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard
of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter\xE2\x80\x99s Hill, as
he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,
and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
deposited on a substratum of cutlass.

The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they
all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but
the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have
taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the
journey.

\xE2\x80\x9CWo-ho!\xE2\x80\x9D said the coachman. \xE2\x80\x9CSo, then! One more pull and you\xE2\x80\x99re at the
top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to
it!--Joe!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa!\xE2\x80\x9D the guard replied.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat o\xE2\x80\x99clock do you make it, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTen minutes, good, past eleven.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy blood!\xE2\x80\x9D ejaculated the vexed coachman, \xE2\x80\x9Cand not atop of Shooter\xE2\x80\x99s
yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!\xE2\x80\x9D

The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,
made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed
suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its
passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach
stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three
had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of
getting shot instantly as a highwayman.

The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses
stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.

\xE2\x80\x9CTst! Joe!\xE2\x80\x9D cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his
box.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you say, Tom?\xE2\x80\x9D

They both listened.

\xE2\x80\x9CI say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the guard, leaving his hold
of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. \xE2\x80\x9CGentlemen! In the king\xE2\x80\x99s
name, all of you!\xE2\x80\x9D

With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on
the offensive.

The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;
the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He
remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained
in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,
and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked
back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up
his ears and looked back, without contradicting.

The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring
of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet
indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the
passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the
quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding
the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.

The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo-ho!\xE2\x80\x9D the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. \xE2\x80\x9CYo there! Stand!
I shall fire!\xE2\x80\x9D

The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,
a man\xE2\x80\x99s voice called from the mist, \xE2\x80\x9CIs that the Dover mail?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever you mind what it is!\xE2\x80\x9D the guard retorted. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat are you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_Is_ that the Dover mail?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy do you want to know?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI want a passenger, if it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat passenger?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Jarvis Lorry.\xE2\x80\x9D

Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,
the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.

\xE2\x80\x9CKeep where you are,\xE2\x80\x9D the guard called to the voice in the mist,
\xE2\x80\x9Cbecause, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in
your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering
speech. \xE2\x80\x9CWho wants me? Is it Jerry?\xE2\x80\x9D

(\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t like Jerry\xE2\x80\x99s voice, if it is Jerry,\xE2\x80\x9D growled the guard to
himself. \xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.\xE2\x80\x9D)

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Mr. Lorry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know this messenger, guard,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the
road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two
passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and
pulled up the window. \xE2\x80\x9CHe may come close; there\xE2\x80\x99s nothing wrong.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope there ain\xE2\x80\x99t, but I can\xE2\x80\x99t make so \xE2\x80\x98Nation sure of that,\xE2\x80\x9D said the
guard, in gruff soliloquy. \xE2\x80\x9CHallo you!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! And hallo you!\xE2\x80\x9D said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome on at a footpace! d\xE2\x80\x99ye mind me? And if you\xE2\x80\x99ve got holsters to that
saddle o\xE2\x80\x99 yourn, don\xE2\x80\x99t let me see your hand go nigh \xE2\x80\x98em. For I\xE2\x80\x99m a devil
at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So
now let\xE2\x80\x99s look at you.\xE2\x80\x9D

The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,
and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider
stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger
a small folded paper. The rider\xE2\x80\x99s horse was blown, and both horse and
rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of
the man.

\xE2\x80\x9CGuard!\xE2\x80\x9D said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.

The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,
answered curtly, \xE2\x80\x9CSir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank. You must
know Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown
to drink. I may read this?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf so be as you\xE2\x80\x99re quick, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and
read--first to himself and then aloud: \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Wait at Dover for Mam\xE2\x80\x99selle.\xE2\x80\x99
It\xE2\x80\x99s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED
TO LIFE.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jerry started in his saddle. \xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s a Blazing strange answer, too,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said he, at his hoarsest.

\xE2\x80\x9CTake that message back, and they will know that I received this, as
well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.\xE2\x80\x9D

With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at
all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted
their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general
pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape
the hazard of originating any other kind of action.

The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round
it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss
in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and
having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,
looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a
few smith\xE2\x80\x99s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was
furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown
and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut
himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,
and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in
five minutes.

\xE2\x80\x9CTom!\xE2\x80\x9D softly over the coach roof.

\xE2\x80\x9CHallo, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you hear the message?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI did, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat did you make of it, Tom?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing at all, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s a coincidence, too,\xE2\x80\x9D the guard mused, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I made the same of it
myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not
only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and
shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of
holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his
heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the
hill.

\xE2\x80\x9CAfter that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won\xE2\x80\x99t trust your
fore-legs till I get you on the level,\xE2\x80\x9D said this hoarse messenger,
glancing at his mare. \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Recalled to life.\xE2\x80\x99 That\xE2\x80\x99s a Blazing strange
message. Much of that wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You\xE2\x80\x99d
be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion,
Jerry!\xE2\x80\x9D




III. The Night Shadows


A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A
solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every
one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every
room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating
heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of
its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the
awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I
turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time
to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable
water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses
of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the
book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read
but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an
eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood
in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,
my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable
consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life\xE2\x80\x99s end. In
any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there
a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their
innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?

As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the
messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the
first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the
three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail
coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had
been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the
breadth of a county between him and the next.

The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at
ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that
assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with
no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they
were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too
far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like
a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and
throat, which descended nearly to the wearer\xE2\x80\x99s knees. When he stopped
for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he
poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he
muffled again.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Jerry, no!\xE2\x80\x9D said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.
\xE2\x80\x9CIt wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
suit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don\xE2\x80\x99t think he\xE2\x80\x99d
been a drinking!\xE2\x80\x9D

His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several
times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,
which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all
over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was
so like Smith\xE2\x80\x99s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might
have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.

While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
watchman in his box at the door of Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank, by Temple Bar, who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such
shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness.
They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.

What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon
its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,
likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms
their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.

Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank
passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what
lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger,
and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special
jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little
coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the
bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great
stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,
and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, with
all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then
the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, with such of their valuable
stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a
little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among
them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them
safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.

But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach
(in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was
always with him, there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one
out of a grave.

Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him
was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did
not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by
years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,
and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,
defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;
so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands
and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was
prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this
spectre:

\xE2\x80\x9CBuried how long?\xE2\x80\x9D

The answer was always the same: \xE2\x80\x9CAlmost eighteen years.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou had abandoned all hope of being dug out?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLong ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know that you are recalled to life?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey tell me so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope you care to live?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t say.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?\xE2\x80\x9D

The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes
the broken reply was, \xE2\x80\x9CWait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon.\xE2\x80\x9D
 Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,
\xE2\x80\x9CTake me to her.\xE2\x80\x9D Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it
was, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know her. I don\xE2\x80\x99t understand.\xE2\x80\x9D

After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,
and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his
hands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth
hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The
passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the
reality of mist and rain on his cheek.

Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving
patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating
by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train
of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the
real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express
sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out
of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost
it again.

\xE2\x80\x9CBuried how long?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAlmost eighteen years.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope you care to live?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t say.\xE2\x80\x9D

Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm
securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two
slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again
slid away into the bank and the grave.

\xE2\x80\x9CBuried how long?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAlmost eighteen years.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou had abandoned all hope of being dug out?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLong ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in
his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the
shadows of the night were gone.

He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a
ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,
and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.

\xE2\x80\x9CEighteen years!\xE2\x80\x9D said the passenger, looking at the sun. \xE2\x80\x9CGracious
Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!\xE2\x80\x9D




IV. The Preparation


When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,
the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his
custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey
from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous
traveller upon.

By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be
congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective
roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp
and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather
like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out
of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and
muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The
tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,
sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.
Show Concord! Gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off
gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)
Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!\xE2\x80\x9D

The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the
Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,
all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another
drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all
loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord
and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a
brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large
square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to
his breakfast.

The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman
in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,
with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,
that he might have been sitting for his portrait.

Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a
loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,
as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain
of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a
fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He
wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his
head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which
looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.
His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,
was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A
face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the
quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and
reserved expression of Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his
cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.
But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank were
principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps
second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.

Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,
Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,
and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a
gentleman from Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank. Please to let me know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir. Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank in London, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A
vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company\xE2\x80\x99s House.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,
sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last
from France.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people\xE2\x80\x99s
time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and
Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen
years ago?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from
the truth.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D

Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the
table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,
dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while
he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the
immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.

When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on
the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away
from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine
ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling
wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was
destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and
brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong
a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little
fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by
night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide
made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,
sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable
that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.

As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became
again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts seemed to cloud
too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting
his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,
digging, digging, in the live red coals.

A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.
Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last
glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has
got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.

He set down his glass untouched. \xE2\x80\x9CThis is Mam\xE2\x80\x99selle!\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette
had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo soon?\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none
then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s
immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.

The gentleman from Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s had nothing left for it but to empty his
glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen
wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette\xE2\x80\x99s apartment.
It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black
horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and
oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room
were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep
graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected
from them until they were dug out.

The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his
way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for
the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall
candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and
the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,
and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As
his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden
hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and
a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth
it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was
not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright
fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his
eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,
of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very
Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran
high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of
the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital
procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were
offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the
feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.

\xE2\x80\x9CPray take a seat, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a
little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI kiss your hand, miss,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier
date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.

\xE2\x80\x9CI received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that
some intelligence--or discovery--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe word is not material, miss; either word will do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so
long dead--\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for
anybody in their absurd baskets!

\xE2\x80\x9C--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate
with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for
the purpose.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMyself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs I was prepared to hear, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a
pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he
was than she. He made her another bow.

\xE2\x80\x9CI replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by
those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to
France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with
me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,
during the journey, under that worthy gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s protection. The
gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to
beg the favour of his waiting for me here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was happy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Cto be entrusted with the charge. I shall
be more happy to execute it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me
by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the
business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a
strong and eager interest to know what they are.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNaturally,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CYes--I--\xE2\x80\x9D

After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
ears, \xE2\x80\x9CIt is very difficult to begin.\xE2\x80\x9D

He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty
and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,
as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing
shadow.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you quite a stranger to me, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAm I not?\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with
an argumentative smile.

Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of
which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression
deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the
moment she raised her eyes again, went on:

\xE2\x80\x9CIn your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you
as a young English lady, Miss Manette?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you please, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to
acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don\xE2\x80\x99t heed me any more than
if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with
your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CStory!\xE2\x80\x9D

He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,
in a hurry, \xE2\x80\x9CYes, customers; in the banking business we usually call
our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific
gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot of Beauvais?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there.
Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that
time in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and
I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other
French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s hands.
In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for
scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;
there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like
sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my
business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in
the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere
machine. To go on--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut this is my father\xE2\x80\x99s story, sir; and I begin to think\xE2\x80\x9D--the
curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--\xE2\x80\x9Cthat when I was
left an orphan through my mother\xE2\x80\x99s surviving my father only two years,
it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then
conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding
the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub
his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking
down into her face while she sat looking up into his.

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself
just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold
with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect
that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance
of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary
Mangle.\xE2\x80\x9D

After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry
flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most
unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was
before), and resumed his former attitude.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your
regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died
when he did--Don\xE2\x80\x99t be frightened! How you start!\xE2\x80\x9D

She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.

\xE2\x80\x9CPray,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from
the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped
him in so violent a tremble: \xE2\x80\x9Cpray control your agitation--a matter of
business. As I was saying--\xE2\x80\x9D

Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:

\xE2\x80\x9CAs I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly
and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not
been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could
trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid
to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the
privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one
to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had
implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of
him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have
been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI entreat you to tell me more, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will. I am going to. You can bear it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. That\xE2\x80\x99s good!\xE2\x80\x9D (Though
his manner was less satisfied than his words.) \xE2\x80\x9CA matter of business.
Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. Now
if this doctor\xE2\x80\x99s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,
had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was
born--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe little child was a daughter, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA daughter. A-a-matter of business--don\xE2\x80\x99t be distressed. Miss, if the
poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,
that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the
inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by
rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don\xE2\x80\x99t kneel! In
Heaven\xE2\x80\x99s name why should you kneel to me!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact
business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly
mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many
shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so
much more at my ease about your state of mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had
very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she
communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s right, that\xE2\x80\x99s right. Courage! Business! You have business before
you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with
you. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened
her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,
to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud
upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his
heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.\xE2\x80\x9D

As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the
flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have
been already tinged with grey.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know that your parents had no great possession, and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new
discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--\xE2\x80\x9D

He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the
forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was
now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too
probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.
Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant
in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to
restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.\xE2\x80\x9D

A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a
low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. \xE2\x80\x9CThere, there,
there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.
You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair
sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side.\xE2\x80\x9D

She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, \xE2\x80\x9CI have been free, I
have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnly one thing more,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her attention: \xE2\x80\x9Che has been found under
another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be
worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to
know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly
held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,
because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject,
anywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all
events--out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of
the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring
to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries,
and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, \xE2\x80\x98Recalled to Life;\xE2\x80\x99
which may mean anything. But what is the matter! She doesn\xE2\x80\x99t notice a
word! Miss Manette!\xE2\x80\x9D

Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she
sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed
upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he
feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called
out loudly for assistance without moving.

A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to
be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some
extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most
wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too,
or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the
inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the
poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him
flying back against the nearest wall.

(\xE2\x80\x9CI really think this must be a man!\xE2\x80\x9D was Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s breathless
reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, look at you all!\xE2\x80\x9D bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.
\xE2\x80\x9CWhy don\xE2\x80\x99t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring
at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don\xE2\x80\x99t you go and fetch
things? I\xE2\x80\x99ll let you know, if you don\xE2\x80\x99t bring smelling-salts, cold
water, and vinegar, quick, I will.\xE2\x80\x9D

There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she
softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and
gentleness: calling her \xE2\x80\x9Cmy precious!\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cmy bird!\xE2\x80\x9D and spreading her
golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you in brown!\xE2\x80\x9D she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;
\xE2\x80\x9Ccouldn\xE2\x80\x99t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her
to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do
you call _that_ being a Banker?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler
sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn
servants under the mysterious penalty of \xE2\x80\x9Cletting them know\xE2\x80\x9D something
not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a
regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head
upon her shoulder.

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope she will do well now,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you accompany Miss Manette to France?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA likely thing, too!\xE2\x80\x9D replied the strong woman. \xE2\x80\x9CIf it was ever
intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence
would have cast my lot in an island?\xE2\x80\x9D

This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to
consider it.




V. The Wine-shop


A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The
accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled
out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just
outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.

All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their
idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular
stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have
thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,
had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own
jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,
made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help
women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all
run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in
the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with
handkerchiefs from women\xE2\x80\x99s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants\xE2\x80\x99
mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;
others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and
there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new
directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed
pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted
fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the
wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up
along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,
if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
presence.

A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,
and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There
was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a
special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part
of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the
luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,
shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen
together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been
most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these
demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who
had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in
motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of
hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men
with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into
the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom
gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.

The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street
in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had
stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many
wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks
on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was
stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.
Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a
tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his
head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled
upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.

The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the
street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.

And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary
gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was
heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;
but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a
terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the
fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,
passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered
in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which
had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the
children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the
grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,
was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out
of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless
chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,
among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the
baker\xE2\x80\x99s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of
bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that
was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every
farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant
drops of oil.

Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding
street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets
diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags
and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and
slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor
compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted
into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or
inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)
were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman
painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of
meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,
croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were
gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler\xE2\x80\x99s knives
and axes were sharp and bright, the smith\xE2\x80\x99s hammers were heavy, and the
gunmaker\xE2\x80\x99s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,
with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but
broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down
the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy
rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across
the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,
and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and
the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.

For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so
long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their
condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over
France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of
song and feather, took no warning.

The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its
appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside
it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle
for the lost wine. \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s not my affair,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, with a final shrug
of the shoulders. \xE2\x80\x9CThe people from the market did it. Let them bring
another.\xE2\x80\x9D

There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,
he called to him across the way:

\xE2\x80\x9CSay, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?\xE2\x80\x9D

The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often
the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is
often the way with his tribe too.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?\xE2\x80\x9D said the wine-shop
keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of
mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. \xE2\x80\x9CWhy do you write
in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place
to write such words in?\xE2\x80\x9D

In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,
perhaps not) upon the joker\xE2\x80\x99s heart. The joker rapped it with his
own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing
attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his
hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly
practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.

\xE2\x80\x9CPut it on, put it on,\xE2\x80\x9D said the other. \xE2\x80\x9CCall wine, wine; and finish
there.\xE2\x80\x9D With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker\xE2\x80\x99s
dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on
his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.

This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,
and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a
bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.
His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good
eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on
the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong
resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing
down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn
the man.

Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he
came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with
a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand
heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of
manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might
have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being
sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright
shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large
earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick
her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported
by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but
coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting
of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while
he stepped over the way.

The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing
dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the
elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, \xE2\x80\x9CThis is our man.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?\xE2\x80\x9D said Monsieur Defarge
to himself; \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know you.\xE2\x80\x9D

But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow goes it, Jacques?\xE2\x80\x9D said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CIs
all the spilt wine swallowed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEvery drop, Jacques,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Monsieur Defarge.

When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,
picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,
and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is not often,\xE2\x80\x9D said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur
Defarge, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or
of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is so, Jacques,\xE2\x80\x9D Monsieur Defarge returned.

At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still
using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of
cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.

The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips.

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I
right, Jacques?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are right, Jacques,\xE2\x80\x9D was the response of Monsieur Defarge.

This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment
when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and
slightly rustled in her seat.

\xE2\x80\x9CHold then! True!\xE2\x80\x9D muttered her husband. \xE2\x80\x9CGentlemen--my wife!\xE2\x80\x9D

The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three
flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and
giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the
wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
of spirit, and became absorbed in it.

\xE2\x80\x9CGentlemen,\xE2\x80\x9D said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly
upon her, \xE2\x80\x9Cgood day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you
wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the
fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here,\xE2\x80\x9D pointing with his hand, \xE2\x80\x9Cnear to the window of
my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been
there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!\xE2\x80\x9D

They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur
Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.

\xE2\x80\x9CWillingly, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to
the door.

Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first
word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had
not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.

Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,
joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited
by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the
gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee
to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was
a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable
transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour
in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,
angry, dangerous man.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.\xE2\x80\x9D
 Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began
ascending the stairs.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he alone?\xE2\x80\x9D the latter whispered.

\xE2\x80\x9CAlone! God help him, who should be with him!\xE2\x80\x9D said the other, in the
same low voice.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he always alone, then?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf his own desire?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they
found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be
discreet--as he was then, so he is now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is greatly changed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CChanged!\xE2\x80\x9D

The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,
and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so
forcible. Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his
two companions ascended higher and higher.

Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded
parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile
indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,
the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides
flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and
hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted
the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost
insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt
and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to
his young companion\xE2\x80\x99s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.
Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made
at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left
uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were
caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer
or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any
promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.

At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the
third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination
and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story
was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in
advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he
dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about
here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over
his shoulder, took out a key.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe door is locked then, my friend?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, surprised.

\xE2\x80\x9CAy. Yes,\xE2\x80\x9D was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think it necessary to turn the key.\xE2\x80\x9D Monsieur Defarge whispered it
closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be
frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what
harm--if his door was left open.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it possible!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it possible!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Defarge, bitterly. \xE2\x80\x9CYes. And a beautiful
world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things
are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under
that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.\xE2\x80\x9D

This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word
of it had reached the young lady\xE2\x80\x99s ears. But, by this time she trembled
under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,
and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent
on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.

\xE2\x80\x9CCourage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a
moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,
all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you
bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.
That\xE2\x80\x99s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!\xE2\x80\x9D

They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were
soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at
once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at
the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which
the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing
footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed
themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
wine-shop.

\xE2\x80\x9CI forgot them in the surprise of your visit,\xE2\x80\x9D explained Monsieur
Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CLeave us, good boys; we have business here.\xE2\x80\x9D

The three glided by, and went silently down.

There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of
the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.
Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you make a show of Monsieur Manette?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that well?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_I_ think it is well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho are the few? How do you choose them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the
sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another
thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in
through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck
twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to
make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,
three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned
it as heavily as he could.

The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the
room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more
than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.

He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry
got his arm securely round the daughter\xE2\x80\x99s waist, and held her; for he
felt that she was sinking.

\xE2\x80\x9CA-a-a-business, business!\xE2\x80\x9D he urged, with a moisture that was not of
business shining on his cheek. \xE2\x80\x9CCome in, come in!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid of it,\xE2\x80\x9D she answered, shuddering.

\xE2\x80\x9COf it? What?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI mean of him. Of my father.\xE2\x80\x9D

Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of
their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her
down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.

Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,
took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,
methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to
where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.

The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim
and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the
roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any
other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this
door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.
Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it
was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being
done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at
him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very
busy, making shoes.




VI. The Shoemaker


\xE2\x80\x9CGood day!\xE2\x80\x9D said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that
bent low over the shoemaking.

It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation, as if it were at a distance:

\xE2\x80\x9CGood day!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are still hard at work, I see?\xE2\x80\x9D

After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the
voice replied, \xE2\x80\x9CYes--I am working.\xE2\x80\x9D This time, a pair of haggard eyes
had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.

The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the
faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo
of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and
suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive
it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,
wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered
home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.

Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked
up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical
perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were
aware of had stood, was not yet empty.

\xE2\x80\x9CI want,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,
\xE2\x80\x9Cto let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?\xE2\x80\x9D

The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,
at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the
other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat did you say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou can bear a little more light?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI must bear it, if you let it in.\xE2\x80\x9D (Laying the palest shadow of a
stress upon the second word.)

The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that
angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his
labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his
feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very
long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and
thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet
dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really
otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.
His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body
to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose
stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion
from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of
parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.

He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones
of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,
pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without
first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had
lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without
first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Defarge,
motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat did you say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don\xE2\x80\x99t know.\xE2\x80\x9D

But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.

Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When
he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker
looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then
the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The
look and the action had occupied but an instant.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have a visitor, you see,\xE2\x80\x9D said Monsieur Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat did you say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHere is a visitor.\xE2\x80\x9D

The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his
work.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome!\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CHere is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when
he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CTell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker\xE2\x80\x99s name.\xE2\x80\x9D

There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CI forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI said, couldn\xE2\x80\x99t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur\xE2\x80\x99s
information?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a lady\xE2\x80\x99s shoe. It is a young lady\xE2\x80\x99s walking-shoe. It is in the
present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.\xE2\x80\x9D He
glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd the maker\xE2\x80\x99s name?\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge.

Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand
in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and
so on in regular changes, without a moment\xE2\x80\x99s intermission. The task of
recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or
endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a
fast-dying man.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you ask me for my name?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAssuredly I did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COne Hundred and Five, North Tower.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that all?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COne Hundred and Five, North Tower.\xE2\x80\x9D

With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work
again, until the silence was again broken.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are not a shoemaker by trade?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly
at him.

His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the
question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back
on the questioner when they had sought the ground.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I
learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--\xE2\x80\x9D

He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his
hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face
from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and
resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a
subject of last night.

\xE2\x80\x9CI asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after
a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.\xE2\x80\x9D

As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr.
Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:

\xE2\x80\x9CMonsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?\xE2\x80\x9D

The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the
questioner.

\xE2\x80\x9CMonsieur Manette\xE2\x80\x9D; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s arm; \xE2\x80\x9Cdo you
remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old
banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your
mind, Monsieur Manette?\xE2\x80\x9D

As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.
Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded
again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where
she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only
raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and
shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression
repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.

Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and
less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he
took the shoe up, and resumed his work.

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you recognised him, monsieur?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Defarge in a whisper.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have
unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so
well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!\xE2\x80\x9D

She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on
which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
over his labour.

Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit,
beside him, and he bent over his work.

It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument
in his hand, for his shoemaker\xE2\x80\x99s knife. It lay on that side of him
which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was
stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He
raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,
but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his
striking at her with the knife, though they had.

He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began
to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in
the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is this?\xE2\x80\x9D

With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her
lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she
laid his ruined head there.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are not the gaoler\xE2\x80\x99s daughter?\xE2\x80\x9D

She sighed \xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho are you?\xE2\x80\x9D

Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench
beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange
thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he
laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.

Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed
aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and
little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action
he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his
shoemaking.

But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his
shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to
be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand
to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained
a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden
hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.

He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. \xE2\x80\x9CIt is
the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!\xE2\x80\x9D

As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to
become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the
light, and looked at her.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned
out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was
brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. \xE2\x80\x98You will
leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they
may in the spirit.\xE2\x80\x99 Those were the words I said. I remember them very
well.\xE2\x80\x9D

He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.
But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,
though slowly.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow was this?--_Was it you_?\xE2\x80\x9D

Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a
frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only
said, in a low voice, \xE2\x80\x9CI entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near
us, do not speak, do not move!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHark!\xE2\x80\x9D he exclaimed. \xE2\x80\x9CWhose voice was that?\xE2\x80\x9D

His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white
hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his
shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and
tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and
gloomily shook his head.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can\xE2\x80\x99t be. See what the
prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face
she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He
was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your
name, my gentle angel?\xE2\x80\x9D

Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees
before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.

\xE2\x80\x9CO, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,
and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I
cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may
tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless
me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!\xE2\x80\x9D

His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and
lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you hear in my voice--I don\xE2\x80\x99t know that it is so, but I hope it
is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was
sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in
touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your
breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when
I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you
with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the
remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,
weep for it, weep for it!\xE2\x80\x9D

She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a
child.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,
and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And
if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,
and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my
honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of
my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep
for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred
tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank
God for us, thank God!\xE2\x80\x9D

He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so
touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.

When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving
breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm
called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and
daughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay
there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his
head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained
him from the light.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf, without disturbing him,\xE2\x80\x9D she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as
he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, \xE2\x80\x9Call could be
arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he
could be taken away--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, consider. Is he fit for the journey?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CMore fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to
him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is true,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. \xE2\x80\x9CMore
than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.
Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s business,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his
methodical manners; \xE2\x80\x9Cand if business is to be done, I had better do it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen be so kind,\xE2\x80\x9D urged Miss Manette, \xE2\x80\x9Cas to leave us here. You see how
composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me
now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from
interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back,
as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until
you return, and then we will remove him straight.\xE2\x80\x9D

Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and
in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage
and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,
for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away
to do it.

Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the
hard ground close at the father\xE2\x80\x99s side, and watched him. The darkness
deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed
through the chinks in the wall.

Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and
had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and
meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the
lamp he carried, on the shoemaker\xE2\x80\x99s bench (there was nothing else in the
garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and
assisted him to his feet.

No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in
the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened,
whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that
he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They
tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to
answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for
the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of
occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen
in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
daughter\xE2\x80\x99s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.

In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he
ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak
and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to
his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand
in both his own.

They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.
Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps
of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and
round at the walls.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat did you say?\xE2\x80\x9D

But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if
she had repeated it.

\xE2\x80\x9CRemember? No, I don\xE2\x80\x99t remember. It was so very long ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his
prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter,
\xE2\x80\x9COne Hundred and Five, North Tower;\xE2\x80\x9D and when he looked about him, it
evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed
him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was
no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he
dropped his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s hand and clasped his head again.

No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the
many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural
silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and
that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and
saw nothing.

The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed
him, when Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s feet were arrested on the step by his asking,
miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame
Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and
went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly
brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned
against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.

Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word \xE2\x80\x9CTo the Barrier!\xE2\x80\x9D The
postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble
over-swinging lamps.

Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better
streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,
illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city
gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. \xE2\x80\x9CYour papers,
travellers!\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CSee here then, Monsieur the Officer,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge,
getting down, and taking him gravely apart, \xE2\x80\x9Cthese are the papers of
monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with
him, at the--\xE2\x80\x9D He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the
military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm
in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day
or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. \xE2\x80\x9CIt is well.
Forward!\xE2\x80\x9D from the uniform. \xE2\x80\x9CAdieu!\xE2\x80\x9D from Defarge. And so, under a short
grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great
grove of stars.

Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from
this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope you care to be recalled to life?\xE2\x80\x9D

And the old answer:

\xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t say.\xE2\x80\x9D


The end of the first book.





Book the Second--the Golden Thread




I. Five Years Later


Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very
dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,
moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were
proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence
in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if
it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was
no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business. Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s (they said) wanted
no elbow-room, Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s wanted no light, Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s wanted no
embellishment. Noakes and Co.\xE2\x80\x99s might, or Snooks Brothers\xE2\x80\x99 might; but
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, thank Heaven--!

Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
question of rebuilding Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s. In this respect the House was much
on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for
suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
objectionable, but were only the more respectable.

Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s was the triumphant perfection
of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s down two steps,
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little
counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,
and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the
heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing
\xE2\x80\x9Cthe House,\xE2\x80\x9D you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,
where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its
hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden
drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they
were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among
the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good
polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms
made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their
parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family
papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great
dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you
by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released
from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads
exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
Abyssinia or Ashantee.

But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s.
Death is Nature\xE2\x80\x99s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation\xE2\x80\x99s?
Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note
was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the
purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder
of a horse at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s door, who made off with it, was put to
Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of
three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to
Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it
might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each
particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
after. Thus, Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, in its day, like greater places of business,
its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid
low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately
disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the
ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.

Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, the
oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young
man into Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s London house, they hid him somewhere till he was
old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full
Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to
be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches
and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.

Outside Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an
odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live
sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless
upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin
of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s,
in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always
tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted
this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful
occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the
easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added
appellation of Jerry.

The scene was Mr. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,
Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March
morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself
always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under
the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a
popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)

Mr. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were
but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it
might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as
it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was
already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged
for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth
was spread.

Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin
at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll
and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair
looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he
exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:

\xE2\x80\x9CBust me, if she ain\xE2\x80\x99t at it agin!\xE2\x80\x9D

A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a
corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the
person referred to.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re at it
agin, are you?\xE2\x80\x9D

After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at
the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the
odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s domestic economy, that,
whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he
often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his
mark--\xE2\x80\x9Cwhat are you up to, Aggerawayter?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was only saying my prayers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSaying your prayers! You\xE2\x80\x99re a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping
yourself down and praying agin me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was not praying against you; I was praying for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou weren\xE2\x80\x99t. And if you were, I won\xE2\x80\x99t be took the liberty with. Here!
your mother\xE2\x80\x99s a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your
father\xE2\x80\x99s prosperity. You\xE2\x80\x99ve got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.
You\xE2\x80\x99ve got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping
herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out
of the mouth of her only child.\xE2\x80\x9D

Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning
to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
board.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what do you suppose, you conceited female,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, with
unconscious inconsistency, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat the worth of _your_ prayers may be?
Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than
that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWorth no more than that,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Mr. Cruncher. \xE2\x80\x9CThey ain\xE2\x80\x99t worth
much, then. Whether or no, I won\xE2\x80\x99t be prayed agin, I tell you. I can\xE2\x80\x99t
afford it. I\xE2\x80\x99m not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. If
you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and
child, and not in opposition to \xE2\x80\x98em. If I had had any but a unnat\xE2\x80\x99ral
wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat\xE2\x80\x99ral mother, I might
have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and
countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.
B-u-u-ust me!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting
on his clothes, \xE2\x80\x9Cif I ain\xE2\x80\x99t, what with piety and one blowed thing and
another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor
devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my
boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and
then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I
tell you,\xE2\x80\x9D here he addressed his wife once more, \xE2\x80\x9CI won\xE2\x80\x99t be gone agin,
in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I\xE2\x80\x99m as sleepy as
laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t know, if
it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t for the pain in \xE2\x80\x98em, which was me and which somebody else, yet
I\xE2\x80\x99m none the better for it in pocket; and it\xE2\x80\x99s my suspicion that you\xE2\x80\x99ve
been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for
it in pocket, and I won\xE2\x80\x99t put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you
say now!\xE2\x80\x9D

Growling, in addition, such phrases as \xE2\x80\x9CAh! yes! You\xE2\x80\x99re religious, too.
You wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband
and child, would you? Not you!\xE2\x80\x9D and throwing off other sarcastic sparks
from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook
himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.
In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,
and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father\xE2\x80\x99s did,
kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor
woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made
his toilet, with a suppressed cry of \xE2\x80\x9CYou are going to flop, mother.
--Halloa, father!\xE2\x80\x9D and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in
again with an undutiful grin.

Mr. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s temper was not at all improved when he came to his
breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s saying grace with particular
animosity.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?\xE2\x80\x9D

His wife explained that she had merely \xE2\x80\x9Casked a blessing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t do it!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected
to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife\xE2\x80\x99s petitions. \xE2\x80\x9CI
ain\xE2\x80\x99t a going to be blest out of house and home. I won\xE2\x80\x99t have my wittles
blest off my table. Keep still!\xE2\x80\x9D

Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party
which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried
his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed
inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock he smoothed his ruffled
aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as
he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation
of the day.

It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite
description of himself as \xE2\x80\x9Ca honest tradesman.\xE2\x80\x9D His stock consisted of
a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool,
young Jerry, walking at his father\xE2\x80\x99s side, carried every morning to
beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where,
with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned
from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man\xE2\x80\x99s
feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr.
Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar
itself,--and was almost as in-looking.

Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his
three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s,
Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry
standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to
inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,
extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic
in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two
eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that
the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the
youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else
in Fleet-street.

The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s
establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:

\xE2\x80\x9CPorter wanted!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHooray, father! Here\xE2\x80\x99s an early job to begin with!\xE2\x80\x9D

Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on
the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
had been chewing, and cogitated.

\xE2\x80\x9CAl-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!\xE2\x80\x9D muttered young Jerry.
\xE2\x80\x9CWhere does my father get all that iron rust from? He don\xE2\x80\x99t get no iron
rust here!\xE2\x80\x9D




II. A Sight


\xE2\x80\x9CYou know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?\xE2\x80\x9D said one of the oldest of
clerks to Jerry the messenger.

\xE2\x80\x9CYe-es, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. \xE2\x80\x9CI _do_
know the Bailey.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJust so. And you know Mr. Lorry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much
better,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment
in question, \xE2\x80\x9Cthan I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the
door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CInto the court, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CInto the court.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to
interchange the inquiry, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you think of this?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAm I to wait in the court, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D he asked, as the result of that
conference.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.
Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s
attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,
to remain there until he wants you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that all, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him
you are there.\xE2\x80\x9D

As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,
Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the
blotting-paper stage, remarked:

\xE2\x80\x9CI suppose they\xE2\x80\x99ll be trying Forgeries this morning?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTreason!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s quartering,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jerry. \xE2\x80\x9CBarbarous!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is the law,\xE2\x80\x9D remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised
spectacles upon him. \xE2\x80\x9CIt is the law.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It\xE2\x80\x99s hard enough to kill
him, but it\xE2\x80\x99s wery hard to spile him, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all,\xE2\x80\x9D retained the ancient clerk. \xE2\x80\x9CSpeak well of the law. Take
care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take
care of itself. I give you that advice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jerry. \xE2\x80\x9CI
leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, well,\xE2\x80\x9D said the old clerk; \xE2\x80\x9Cwe all have our various ways of
gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry
ways. Here is the letter. Go along.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal
deference than he made an outward show of, \xE2\x80\x9CYou are a lean old one,
too,\xE2\x80\x9D made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,
and went his way.

They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had
not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.
But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came
into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It
had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced
his own doom as certainly as the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s, and even died before him.
For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,
from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on
a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a
half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.
So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It
was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted
a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for
the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and
softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in
blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice
illustration of the precept, that \xE2\x80\x9CWhatever is is right;\xE2\x80\x9D an aphorism
that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome
consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.

Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this
hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in
his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play
at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the
former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey
doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the
criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.

After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into
court.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s on?\xE2\x80\x9D he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next
to.

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing yet.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s coming on?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe Treason case.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe quartering one, eh?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D returned the man, with a relish; \xE2\x80\x9Che\xE2\x80\x99ll be drawn on a hurdle to
be half hanged, and then he\xE2\x80\x99ll be taken down and sliced before his own
face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,
and then his head will be chopped off, and he\xE2\x80\x99ll be cut into quarters.
That\xE2\x80\x99s the sentence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf he\xE2\x80\x99s found Guilty, you mean to say?\xE2\x80\x9D Jerry added, by way of proviso.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! they\xE2\x80\x99ll find him guilty,\xE2\x80\x9D said the other. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t you be afraid of
that.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he
saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. Mr. Lorry
sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged
gentleman, the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s counsel, who had a great bundle of papers
before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands
in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him
then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing
with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up
to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s _he_ got to do with the case?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the man he had spoken with.

\xE2\x80\x9CBlest if I know,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jerry.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBlest if I know that either,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jerry.

The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the
central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,
went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.

Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled
at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round
pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows
stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,
laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help
themselves, at anybody\xE2\x80\x99s cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got
upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.
Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall
of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with
the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,
that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him
in an impure mist and rain.

The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about
five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and
a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly
dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and
dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out
of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express
itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his
situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the
soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed,
bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.

The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,
was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less
horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his
fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various
spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and
powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.

Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to
an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that
he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so
forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers
occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French
King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and
so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of
our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the
said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise
evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our
said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation
to send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with
huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood
there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and
that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.

The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged,
beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from
the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and
attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;
and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so
composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.

Over the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s head there was a mirror, to throw the light down
upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
it, and had passed from its surface and this earth\xE2\x80\x99s together. Haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the
glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one
day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s mind. Be
that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his
face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.

It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court
which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat,
in that corner of the Judge\xE2\x80\x99s bench, two persons upon whom his look
immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his
aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.

The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than
twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very
remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair,
and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,
but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he
looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as
it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a
handsome man, not past the prime of life.

His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by
him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her
dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had
been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very
noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who
had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about,
\xE2\x80\x9CWho are they?\xE2\x80\x9D

Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own
manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about
him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and
from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got
to Jerry:

\xE2\x80\x9CWitnesses.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor which side?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAgainst.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAgainst what side?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them,
leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was
in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the
axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.




III. A Disappointment


Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before
them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the
public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or
even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the
prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and
repassing between France and England, on secret business of which
he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of
traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real
wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.
That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who
was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the
prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his
Majesty\xE2\x80\x99s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.
That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and
attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s
friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues
were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public
benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as
they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,
as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well
knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;
whereat the jury\xE2\x80\x99s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more
especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.
That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had
communicated itself to the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s servant, and had engendered in him
a holy determination to examine his master\xE2\x80\x99s table-drawers and pockets,
and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to
hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,
in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General\xE2\x80\x99s)
brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.
Attorney-General\xE2\x80\x99s) father and mother. That, he called with confidence
on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two
witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
his Majesty\xE2\x80\x99s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by
sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be
proved to be in the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s handwriting; but that it was all the
same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as
showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof
would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged
in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the
very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.
That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they
were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must
positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether
they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their
pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion
of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that
there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon
pillows at all, unless the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s head was taken off. That head
Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of
everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith
of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
good as dead and gone.

When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in
anticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.

Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader\xE2\x80\x99s lead, examined the
patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul was
exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if
it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom
of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the
wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.
Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting
opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.

Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation.
What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property? He didn\xE2\x80\x99t
precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybody\xE2\x80\x99s.
Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very
distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtors\xE2\x80\x99
prison? Didn\xE2\x80\x99t see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtors\xE2\x80\x99
prison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three
times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever
been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs?
Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell
downstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at
dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who
committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true?
Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not
more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes.
Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a
very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?
No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more
about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No.
Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government
pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear
no. Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer
patriotism? None whatever.

The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a
great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.
He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of
the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging
his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s desk. He had not put them there first. He
had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen
at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and
Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn\xE2\x80\x99t bear it, and had given
information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;
that was merely a coincidence. He didn\xE2\x80\x99t call it a particularly curious
coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. He
was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.

The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis
Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s bank?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COn a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and
Dover by the mail?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWere there any other passengers in the mail?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid they alight on the road in the course of the night?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot undertake to say that he was.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDoes he resemble either of these two passengers?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBoth were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so
reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as
those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to
render it unlikely that he was one of them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo at least you say he may have been one of them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. Except that I remember them both to have been--like
myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous
air.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI certainly have seen that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him, to your
certain knowledge, before?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the
prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the
voyage with me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt what hour did he come on board?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt a little after midnight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on board
at that untimely hour?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe happened to be the only one.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever mind about \xE2\x80\x98happening,\xE2\x80\x99 Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who
came on board in the dead of the night?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe was.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWere you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and
I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Manette!\xE2\x80\x9D

The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now
turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her, and
kept her hand drawn through his arm.

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Manette, look upon the prisoner.\xE2\x80\x9D

To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was
far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.
Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all
the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him
to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts
to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
rushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COn board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same
occasion.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are the young lady just now referred to?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO! most unhappily, I am!\xE2\x80\x9D

The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice
of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: \xE2\x80\x9CAnswer the questions put
to you, and make no remark upon them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
passage across the Channel?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRecall it.\xE2\x80\x9D

In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: \xE2\x80\x9CWhen the
gentleman came on board--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you mean the prisoner?\xE2\x80\x9D inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, my Lord.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen say the prisoner.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,\xE2\x80\x9D turning
her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, \xE2\x80\x9Cwas much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was
afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the
deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take
care of him. There were no other passengers that night, but we four.
The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could
shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I
had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would
set when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed
great gentleness and kindness for my father\xE2\x80\x99s state, and I am sure he
felt it. That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow many were with him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo French gentlemen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHad they conferred together?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey had conferred together until the last moment, when it was
necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHad any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSome papers had been handed about among them, but I don\xE2\x80\x99t know what
papers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLike these in shape and size?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPossibly, but indeed I don\xE2\x80\x99t know, although they stood whispering very
near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they
spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that
they looked at papers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, to the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s conversation, Miss Manette.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out
of my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my
father. I hope,\xE2\x80\x9D bursting into tears, \xE2\x80\x9CI may not repay him by doing him
harm to-day.\xE2\x80\x9D

Buzzing from the blue-flies.

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must
give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness,
he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was
therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business
had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,
take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long
time to come.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said
that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on
England\xE2\x80\x99s part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George
Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the
Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said
laughingly, and to beguile the time.\xE2\x80\x9D

Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be
unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully
anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when
she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon
the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority
of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,
when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
heresy about George Washington.

Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it
necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady\xE2\x80\x99s
father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.

\xE2\x80\x9CDoctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnce. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or
three years and a half ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCan you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or
speak to his conversation with your daughter?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSir, I can do neither.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
either?\xE2\x80\x9D

He answered, in a low voice, \xE2\x80\x9CThere is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHas it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without
trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?\xE2\x80\x9D

He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, \xE2\x80\x9CA long imprisonment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWere you newly released on the occasion in question?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey tell me so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you no remembrance of the occasion?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNone. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what
time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the
time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter
here. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored
my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become
familiar. I have no remembrance of the process.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down
together.

A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand being
to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked,
in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and
got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did
not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more,
to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness
was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required,
in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town,
waiting for another person. The prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s counsel was cross-examining
this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner
on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a
little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening
this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great
attention and curiosity at the prisoner.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?\xE2\x80\x9D

The witness was quite sure.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?\xE2\x80\x9D

Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.

\xE2\x80\x9CLook well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,\xE2\x80\x9D pointing
to him who had tossed the paper over, \xE2\x80\x9Cand then look well upon the
prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?\xE2\x80\x9D

Allowing for my learned friend\xE2\x80\x99s appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,
not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought
into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became
much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s
counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned
friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he
would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might
happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so
confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to smash
this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to
useless lumber.

Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
fingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while Mr.
Stryver fitted the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s case on the jury, like a compact suit
of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and
traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look
rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,
and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family
affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making
those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a
consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him,
even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped
and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they
had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent
gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that
reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.
How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;
how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous
character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the
State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed
(with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could
not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.

Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to
attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr.
Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and
Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the
prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning
the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole
decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.

And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.

Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,
changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.
While his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him,
whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced
anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and
grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,
and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man
sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put
on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his
hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him
a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he
undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,
when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the
lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would
hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the
observation to his next neighbour, and added, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99d hold half a guinea
that _he_ don\xE2\x80\x99t get no law-work to do. Don\xE2\x80\x99t look like the sort of one
to get any, do he?\xE2\x80\x9D

Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette\xE2\x80\x99s head dropped upon
her father\xE2\x80\x99s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:
\xE2\x80\x9COfficer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out.
Don\xE2\x80\x99t you see she will fall!\xE2\x80\x9D

There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much
sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to
him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown
strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or
brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,
ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a
moment, spoke, through their foreman.

They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George
Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,
but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,
and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in
the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the
jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get
refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat
down.

Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out,
now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest,
could easily get near him.

\xE2\x80\x9CJerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the
way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don\xE2\x80\x99t be a moment
behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You
are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long
before I can.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in
acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up
at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow is the young lady?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she
feels the better for being out of court.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll tell the prisoner so. It won\xE2\x80\x99t do for a respectable bank gentleman
like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point
in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar.
The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all
eyes, ears, and spikes.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darnay!\xE2\x80\x9D

The prisoner came forward directly.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She
will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so
for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I could. I will, if you ask it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Carton\xE2\x80\x99s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood,
half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, still only half turned towards him, \xE2\x80\x9Cdo you expect,
Mr. Darnay?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe worst.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their
withdrawing is in your favour.\xE2\x80\x9D

Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no
more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other
in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above
them.

An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded
passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.
The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that
refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide
of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along
with them.

\xE2\x80\x9CJerry! Jerry!\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got
there.

\xE2\x80\x9CHere, sir! It\xE2\x80\x99s a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. \xE2\x80\x9CQuick! Have you got
it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

Hastily written on the paper was the word \xE2\x80\x9CACQUITTED.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you had sent the message, \xE2\x80\x98Recalled to Life,\xE2\x80\x99 again,\xE2\x80\x9D muttered
Jerry, as he turned, \xE2\x80\x9CI should have known what you meant, this time.\xE2\x80\x9D

He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else,
until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out
with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz
swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in
search of other carrion.




IV. Congratulatory


From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor
for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.
Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from
death.

It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him
twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and
to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent
reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long
lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition
from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of
itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those
unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual
Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three
hundred miles away.

Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his
misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,
the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial
influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could
recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few
and slight, and she believed them over.

Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned
to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little
more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,
loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing
way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and
conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.

He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his
late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean
out of the group: \xE2\x80\x9CI am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.
Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the
less likely to succeed on that account.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said his late client, taking his hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as
another man\xE2\x80\x99s, I believe.\xE2\x80\x9D

It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, \xE2\x80\x9CMuch better,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry
said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
object of squeezing himself back again.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou think so?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Stryver. \xE2\x80\x9CWell! you have been present all day,
and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd as such,\xE2\x80\x9D quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had
now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered
him out of it--\xE2\x80\x9Cas such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up
this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.
Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver; \xE2\x80\x9CI have a night\xE2\x80\x99s work to
do yet. Speak for yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI speak for myself,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Cand for Mr. Darnay, and for
Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?\xE2\x80\x9D
 He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.

His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at
Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,
not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his
thoughts had wandered away.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy father,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.

He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.

\xE2\x80\x9CShall we go home, my father?\xE2\x80\x9D

With a long breath, he answered \xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the
impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be
released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the
passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,
and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning\xE2\x80\x99s interest of
gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.
Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into
the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter
departed in it.

Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back
to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or
interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning
against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now
stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?\xE2\x80\x9D

Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton\xE2\x80\x99s part in the day\xE2\x80\x99s
proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the
better for it in appearance.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the
business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business
appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, \xE2\x80\x9CYou have mentioned that before,
sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We
have to think of the House more than ourselves.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_I_ know, _I_ know,\xE2\x80\x9D rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t be
nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,
I dare say.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd indeed, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, \xE2\x80\x9CI really don\xE2\x80\x99t
know what you have to do with the matter. If you\xE2\x80\x99ll excuse me, as very
much your elder, for saying so, I really don\xE2\x80\x99t know that it is your
business.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBusiness! Bless you, _I_ have no business,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Carton.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a pity you have not, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think so, too.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you had,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Cperhaps you would attend to it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLord love you, no!--I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Carton.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,
\xE2\x80\x9Cbusiness is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,
if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.
Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance
for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!
I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
life.--Chair there!\xE2\x80\x9D

Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.
Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s. Carton,
who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed
then, and turned to Darnay:

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must
be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on
these street stones?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hardly seem yet,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Charles Darnay, \xE2\x80\x9Cto belong to this world
again.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t wonder at it; it\xE2\x80\x99s not so long since you were pretty far
advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI begin to think I _am_ faint.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen why the devil don\xE2\x80\x99t you dine? I dined, myself, while those
numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or
some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.\xE2\x80\x9D

Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to
Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were
shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting
his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat
opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port
before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.
Darnay?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far
mended as to feel that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt must be an immense satisfaction!\xE2\x80\x9D

He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large
one.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we
are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are
not much alike in any particular, you and I.\xE2\x80\x9D

Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with
this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was
at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow your dinner is done,\xE2\x80\x9D Carton presently said, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy don\xE2\x80\x99t you call a
health, Mr. Darnay; why don\xE2\x80\x99t you give your toast?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat health? What toast?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, it\xE2\x80\x99s on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I\xE2\x80\x99ll
swear it\xE2\x80\x99s there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Manette, then!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Manette, then!\xE2\x80\x9D

Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton
flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to
pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!\xE2\x80\x9D
 he said, filling his new goblet.

A slight frown and a laconic \xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D were the answer.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it
feel? Is it worth being tried for one\xE2\x80\x99s life, to be the object of such
sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\xE2\x80\x9D

Again Darnay answered not a word.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not
that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\xE2\x80\x9D

The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this
disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the
strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him
for it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\xE2\x80\x9D was the careless rejoinder.
\xE2\x80\x9CIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don\xE2\x80\x99t know why I did
it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you think I particularly like you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CReally, Mr. Carton,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \xE2\x80\x9CI have
not asked myself the question.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut ask yourself the question now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have acted as if you do; but I don\xE2\x80\x99t think you do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_I_ don\xE2\x80\x99t think I do,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton. \xE2\x80\x9CI begin to have a very good
opinion of your understanding.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNevertheless,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \xE2\x80\x9Cthere is
nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our
parting without ill-blood on either side.\xE2\x80\x9D

Carton rejoining, \xE2\x80\x9CNothing in life!\xE2\x80\x9D Darnay rang. \xE2\x80\x9CDo you call the whole
reckoning?\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \xE2\x80\x9CThen
bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at
ten.\xE2\x80\x9D

The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.
Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat
of defiance in his manner, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CA last word, Mr. Darnay: you think
I am drunk?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThink? You know I have been drinking.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSince I must say so, I know it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I
care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMuch to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don\xE2\x80\x99t let your sober face elate you,
however; you don\xE2\x80\x99t know what it may come to. Good night!\xE2\x80\x9D

When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a
glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you particularly like the man?\xE2\x80\x9D he muttered, at his own image; \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy
should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing
in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have
made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you
what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change
places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as
he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and
have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow.\xE2\x80\x9D

He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few
minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the
table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.




V. The Jackal


Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is
the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate
statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a
perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.
The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr.
Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the
drier parts of the legal race.

A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had
begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite,
specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the
visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King\xE2\x80\x99s Bench, the
florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of
the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.

It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib
man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that
faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is
among the most striking and necessary of the advocate\xE2\x80\x99s accomplishments.
But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more
business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney
Carton, he always had his points at his fingers\xE2\x80\x99 ends in the morning.

Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver\xE2\x80\x99s great
ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas,
might have floated a king\xE2\x80\x99s ship. Stryver never had a case in hand,
anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring
at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily
to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about,
among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton
would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he
rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.

\xE2\x80\x9CTen o\xE2\x80\x99clock, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to
wake him--\xE2\x80\x9Cten o\xE2\x80\x99clock, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_What\xE2\x80\x99s_ the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTen o\xE2\x80\x99clock, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean? Ten o\xE2\x80\x99clock at night?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! I remember. Very well, very well.\xE2\x80\x9D

After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man
dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes,
he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple,
and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King\xE2\x80\x99s
Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.

The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone
home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers on,
and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He
had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which
may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of
Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of
Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a little late, Memory,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver.

\xE2\x80\x9CAbout the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.\xE2\x80\x9D

They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers,
where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in
the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon
it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day\xE2\x80\x99s client; or
seeing him dine--it\xE2\x80\x99s all one!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the
identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have
been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining
room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel
or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them
out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down
at the table, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CNow I am ready!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Stryver,
gaily, as he looked among his papers.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow much?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnly two sets of them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGive me the worst first.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere they are, Sydney. Fire away!\xE2\x80\x9D

The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the
drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table
proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to
his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in
a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some
lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,
so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or
more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the
matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on
him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the
jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
gravity.

At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and
proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,
made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal
assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his
hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then
invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application
to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;
this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not
disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr.
Stryver.

The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming
again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses
to-day. Every question told.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI always am sound; am I not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to
it and smooth it again.\xE2\x80\x9D

With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, nodding
his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe
old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and
now in despondency!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D returned the other, sighing: \xE2\x80\x9Cyes! The same Sydney, with the same
luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd why not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGod knows. It was my way, I suppose.\xE2\x80\x9D

He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
him, looking at the fire.

\xE2\x80\x9CCarton,\xE2\x80\x9D said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,
as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney
Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, \xE2\x80\x9Cyour way
is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look
at me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, botheration!\xE2\x80\x9D returned Sydney, with a lighter and more
good-humoured laugh, \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t _you_ be moral!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow have I done what I have done?\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver; \xE2\x80\x9Chow do I do what I
do?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPartly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it\xE2\x80\x99s not worth
your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to
do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.

\xE2\x80\x9CBefore Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,\xE2\x80\x9D
 pursued Carton, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into
mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,
picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we
didn\xE2\x80\x99t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always
nowhere.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd whose fault was that?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always
driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree
that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It\xE2\x80\x99s a gloomy
thing, however, to talk about one\xE2\x80\x99s own past, with the day breaking.
Turn me in some other direction before I go.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, holding up
his glass. \xE2\x80\x9CAre you turned in a pleasant direction?\xE2\x80\x9D

Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.

\xE2\x80\x9CPretty witness,\xE2\x80\x9D he muttered, looking down into his glass. \xE2\x80\x9CI have had
enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who\xE2\x80\x99s your pretty witness?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe picturesque doctor\xE2\x80\x99s daughter, Miss Manette.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_She_ pretty?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs she not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge
of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know, Sydney,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,
and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: \xE2\x80\x9Cdo you know, I rather
thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,
and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CQuick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a
yard or two of a man\xE2\x80\x99s nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.
I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I\xE2\x80\x99ll have no more drink;
I\xE2\x80\x99ll get to bed.\xE2\x80\x9D

When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light
him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the
dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a
lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and
the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.

Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still
on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the
wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and
perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries
from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the
fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of
houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its
pillow was wet with wasted tears.

Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,
incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight
on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.




VI. Hundreds of People


The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not
far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the
waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried
it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis
Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,
on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into
business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s friend, and the
quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.

On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in
the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine
Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with
them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and
generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have
his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the
Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
them.

A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be
found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of
the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,
north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers
grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a
consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,
instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which
the peaches ripened in their season.

The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,
though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful
place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.

There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and
there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where
several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was
audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In
a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree
rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver
to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if
he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all
visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured
to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have
a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray
workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a
thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind
the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way
from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.

Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and
its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.
His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and
he earned as much as he wanted.

These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s knowledge, thoughts, and
notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,
on the fine Sunday afternoon.

\xE2\x80\x9CDoctor Manette at home?\xE2\x80\x9D

Expected home.

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Lucie at home?\xE2\x80\x9D

Expected home.

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Pross at home?\xE2\x80\x9D

Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the
fact.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs I am at home myself,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll go upstairs.\xE2\x80\x9D

Although the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s daughter had known nothing of the country of her
birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off
by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,
that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the
rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,
the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by
delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in
themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry
stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,
with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
time, whether he approved?

There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they
communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was
the best room, and in it were Lucie\xE2\x80\x99s birds, and flowers, and books,
and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was
the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,
changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker\xE2\x80\x99s
bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.

\xE2\x80\x9CI wonder,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he keeps
that reminder of his sufferings about him!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd why wonder at that?\xE2\x80\x9D was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.

It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose
acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and
had since improved.

\xE2\x80\x9CI should have thought--\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry began.

\xE2\x80\x9CPooh! You\xE2\x80\x99d have thought!\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow do you do?\xE2\x80\x9D inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to
express that she bore him no malice.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am pretty well, I thank you,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; \xE2\x80\x9Chow
are you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing to boast of,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross. \xE2\x80\x9CI am very much put out about my
Ladybird.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor gracious sake say something else besides \xE2\x80\x98indeed,\xE2\x80\x99 or you\xE2\x80\x99ll
fidget me to death,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from
stature) was shortness.

\xE2\x80\x9CReally, then?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.

\xE2\x80\x9CReally, is bad enough,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut better. Yes, I am
very much put out.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I ask the cause?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to
come here looking after her,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross.

\xE2\x80\x9C_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHundreds,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross.

It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her
time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,
she exaggerated it.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear me!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and
paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take
your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her
for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it\xE2\x80\x99s really very hard,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Miss Pross.

Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;
using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
fit anything.

\xE2\x80\x9CAll sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,
are always turning up,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross. \xE2\x80\x9CWhen you began it--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_I_ began it, Miss Pross?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDidn\xE2\x80\x99t you? Who brought her father to life?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! If _that_ was beginning it--\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt wasn\xE2\x80\x99t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard
enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven
him), to take Ladybird\xE2\x80\x99s affections away from me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by
this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those
unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and
admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost
it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there
is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so
rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted
respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss
Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Miss Pross; \xE2\x80\x9Cand that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn\xE2\x80\x99t made a
mistake in life.\xE2\x80\x9D

Here again: Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s inquiries into Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s personal history had
established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel
who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to
speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with
no touch of compunction. Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s fidelity of belief in Solomon
(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious
matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of
business,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had
sat down there in friendly relations, \xE2\x80\x9Clet me ask you--does the Doctor,
in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. \xE2\x80\x9CBut I don\xE2\x80\x99t say he don\xE2\x80\x99t
refer to it within himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you believe that he thinks of it much?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you imagine--\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up
short with:

\xE2\x80\x9CNever imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,
sometimes?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow and then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you suppose,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his
bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat Doctor Manette has any
theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
oppressor?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd that is--?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat she thinks he has.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow don\xE2\x80\x99t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a
mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDull?\xE2\x80\x9D Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.

Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, \xE2\x80\x9CNo, no,
no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor
Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,
though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now
intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss
Pross, I don\xE2\x80\x99t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of
zealous interest.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! To the best of my understanding, and bad\xE2\x80\x99s the best, you\xE2\x80\x99ll tell
me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, \xE2\x80\x9Che is afraid
of the whole subject.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAfraid?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It\xE2\x80\x99s a dreadful
remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not
knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never
feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t make the
subject pleasant, I should think.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. \xE2\x80\x9CTrue,\xE2\x80\x9D said
he, \xE2\x80\x9Cand fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss
Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression
always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness
it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCan\xE2\x80\x99t be helped,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, shaking her head. \xE2\x80\x9CTouch that
string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.
In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in
the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking
up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to
know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in
his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up
and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says
a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it
best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down
together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have
brought him to himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

Notwithstanding Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s denial of her own imagination, there was a
perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,
in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to
her possessing such a thing.

The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going.

\xE2\x80\x9CHere they are!\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;
\xE2\x80\x9Cand now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!\xE2\x80\x9D

It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a
peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,
looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied
they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though
the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close
at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross
was ready at the street door to receive them.

Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking
off her darling\xE2\x80\x99s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and
folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with
as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant
sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against
her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do
playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own
chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at
them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would
have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor
stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no
Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain
for the fulfilment of Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s prediction.

Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of
the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest
quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be
better. Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s friendship being of the thoroughly practical
kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of
impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would
impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters
of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,
or Cinderella\xE2\x80\x99s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,
a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
pleased.

On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s table, but on other days
persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower
regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to
which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,
Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird\xE2\x80\x99s pleasant face and pleasant efforts
to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.

It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some
time before, as Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the
plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs
and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
whispered to them in its own way above their heads.

Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
was only One.

Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross
suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and
retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, \xE2\x80\x9Ca fit of the
jerks.\xE2\x80\x9D

The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The
resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as
they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting
his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the
likeness.

He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
vivacity. \xE2\x80\x9CPray, Doctor Manette,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the
plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
which happened to be the old buildings of London--\xE2\x80\x9Chave you seen much of
the Tower?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of
it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_I_ have been there, as you remember,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darnay, with a smile,
though reddening a little angrily, \xE2\x80\x9Cin another character, and not in a
character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a
curious thing when I was there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat was that?\xE2\x80\x9D Lucie asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CIn making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which
had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of
its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone
in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to
execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with
some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.
At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully
examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or
legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses
were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested
that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The
floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the
earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found
the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he
had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy father,\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Lucie, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are ill!\xE2\x80\x9D

He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and
his look quite terrified them all.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they
made me start. We had better go in.\xE2\x80\x9D

He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large
drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he
said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry
either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned
towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it
when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.

He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of
his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
that the rain had startled him.

Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon
her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he
made only Two.

The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was
done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the
heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton
leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of
the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the
ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,\xE2\x80\x9D said Doctor
Manette. \xE2\x80\x9CIt comes slowly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt comes surely,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton.

They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a
dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.

There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes
resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a
footstep was there.

\xE2\x80\x9CA multitude of people, and yet a solitude!\xE2\x80\x9D said Darnay, when they had
listened for a while.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Lucie. \xE2\x80\x9CSometimes, I have
sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of
a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
solemn--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet us shudder too. We may know what it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we
originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have
sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made
the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
by-and-bye into our lives.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,\xE2\x80\x9D
 Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.

The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more
rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,
as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some
coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in
the distant streets, and not one within sight.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or
are we to divide them among us?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you
asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and
then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
into my life, and my father\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI take them into mine!\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton. \xE2\x80\x9C_I_ ask no questions and make no
stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,
and I see them--by the Lightning.\xE2\x80\x9D He added the last words, after there
had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I hear them!\xE2\x80\x9D he added again, after a peal of thunder. \xE2\x80\x9CHere they
come, fast, fierce, and furious!\xE2\x80\x9D

It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,
for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and
lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment\xE2\x80\x99s
interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at
midnight.

The great bell of Saint Paul\xE2\x80\x99s was striking one in the cleared air, when
Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set
forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches
of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful
of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was
usually performed a good two hours earlier.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Cto
bring the dead out of their graves.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don\xE2\x80\x99t expect to--what
would do that,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Jerry.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood night, Mr. Carton,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man of business. \xE2\x80\x9CGood night, Mr.
Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!\xE2\x80\x9D

Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar,
bearing down upon them, too.




VII. Monseigneur in Town


Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his
fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in
his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur
was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many
things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning\xE2\x80\x99s chocolate could not so
much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four
strong men besides the Cook.

Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the
Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to
conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur\xE2\x80\x99s lips. One lacquey carried
the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed
the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;
a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold
watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to
dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon
his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
men; he must have died of two.

Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy
and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at
a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so
impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far
more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance
for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly
favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted
days of the merry Stuart who sold it.

Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which
was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public
business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and
particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world
was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original
by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: \xE2\x80\x9CThe earth and the fulness
thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.\xE2\x80\x9D

Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of
affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances
public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and
must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances
private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after
generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence
Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet
time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could
wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,
poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with
a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer
rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior
mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked
down upon him with the loftiest contempt.

A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his
stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women
waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial
relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality
among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.

For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with
every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any
reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not
so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost
equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would
have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have
been anybody\xE2\x80\x99s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers
destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;
civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the
worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;
all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in
pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of
Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the
score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,
yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives
passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were
no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly
patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had
discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears
they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving
Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making
card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving
Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this
wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of
the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been
since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of
exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various
notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies
among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half
of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among
the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and
appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of
bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far
towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing
known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,
and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
supped as at twenty.

The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that
things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting
them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic
sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves
whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the
spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the
Future, for Monseigneur\xE2\x80\x99s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other
three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
jargon about \xE2\x80\x9Cthe Centre of Truth:\xE2\x80\x9D holding that Man had got out of the
Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got
out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of
the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,
by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much
discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never
became manifest.

But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of
Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been
ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally
correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such
delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant
swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would
surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen
of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;
and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and
his devouring hunger far away.

Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that
was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through
Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals
of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball
descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was
required to officiate \xE2\x80\x9Cfrizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,
and white silk stockings.\xE2\x80\x9D At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a
rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call
him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at
Monseigneur\xE2\x80\x99s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled
hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would
see the very stars out!

Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown
open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and
fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in
body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have
been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never
troubled it.

Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one
happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably
passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of
Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due
course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
sprites, and was seen no more.

The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,
and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon
but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm
and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his
way out.

\xE2\x80\x9CI devote you,\xE2\x80\x9D said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,
and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, \xE2\x80\x9Cto the Devil!\xE2\x80\x9D

With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.

He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and
with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every
feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,
beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top
of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little
change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing
colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of
treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with
attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much
too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a
handsome face, and a remarkable one.

Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and
drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had
stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer
in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable
to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and
often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were
charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had
sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,
that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician
custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second
time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were
left to get out of their difficulties as they could.

With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of
consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage
dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming
before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its
wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a
number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.

But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have
stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded
behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,
and there were twenty hands at the horses\xE2\x80\x99 bridles.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat has gone wrong?\xE2\x80\x9D said Monsieur, calmly looking out.

A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was
down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.

\xE2\x80\x9CPardon, Monsieur the Marquis!\xE2\x80\x9D said a ragged and submissive man, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is
a child.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CExcuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.\xE2\x80\x9D

The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,
into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly
got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the
Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.

\xE2\x80\x9CKilled!\xE2\x80\x9D shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at
their length above his head, and staring at him. \xE2\x80\x9CDead!\xE2\x80\x9D

The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was
nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the
people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they
remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat
and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes
over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.

He took out his purse.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is extraordinary to me,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you people cannot take care
of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in
the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give
him that.\xE2\x80\x9D

He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads
craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The
tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, \xE2\x80\x9CDead!\xE2\x80\x9D

He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest
made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,
sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were
stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They
were as silent, however, as the men.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know all, I know all,\xE2\x80\x9D said the last comer. \xE2\x80\x9CBe a brave man, my
Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to
live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour
as happily?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a philosopher, you there,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis, smiling. \xE2\x80\x9CHow do
they call you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey call me Defarge.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf what trade?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis,
throwing him another gold coin, \xE2\x80\x9Cand spend it as you will. The horses
there; are they right?\xE2\x80\x9D

Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the
Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the
air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had
paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly
disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.

\xE2\x80\x9CHold!\xE2\x80\x9D said Monsieur the Marquis. \xE2\x80\x9CHold the horses! Who threw that?\xE2\x80\x9D

He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a
moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the
figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou dogs!\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,
except as to the spots on his nose: \xE2\x80\x9CI would ride over any of you very
willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal
threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he
should be crushed under the wheels.\xE2\x80\x9D

So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of
what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not
a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.
But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the
Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his
contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he
leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word \xE2\x80\x9CGo on!\xE2\x80\x9D

He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick
succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the
Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the
whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats
had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking
on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the
spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through
which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and
bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle
while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running
of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who
had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness
of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran
into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,
time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together
in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all
things ran their course.




VIII. Monseigneur in the Country


A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.
Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On
inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent
tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected
disposition to give up, and wither away.

Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been
lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up
a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was
no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was
occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting
sun.

The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. \xE2\x80\x9CIt will
die out,\xE2\x80\x9D said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, \xE2\x80\x9Cdirectly.\xE2\x80\x9D

In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the
heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down
hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed
quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow
left when the drag was taken off.

But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village
at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a
church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a
fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects
as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was
coming near home.

The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor
tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor
fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All
its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,
shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the
fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of
the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,
were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax
for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be
paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until
the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.

Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,
their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest
terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;
or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.

Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions\xE2\x80\x99
whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as
if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in
his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the
fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.
He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow
sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the
meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the
truth through the best part of a hundred years.

Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before
Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces
drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender
of the roads joined the group.

\xE2\x80\x9CBring me hither that fellow!\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis to the courier.

The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round
to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.

\xE2\x80\x9CI passed you on the road?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CComing up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, it is true.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat did you look at, so fixedly?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, I looked at the man.\xE2\x80\x9D

He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat man, pig? And why look there?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho?\xE2\x80\x9D demanded the traveller.

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, the man.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You
know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of
all the days of my life, I never saw him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSwinging by the chain? To be suffocated?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.
His head hanging over--like this!\xE2\x80\x9D

He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his
face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered
himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat was he like?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,
white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!\xE2\x80\x9D

The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all
eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur
the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his
conscience.

\xE2\x80\x9CTruly, you did well,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such
vermin were not to ruffle him, \xE2\x80\x9Cto see a thief accompanying my carriage,
and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur
Gabelle!\xE2\x80\x9D

Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary
united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
official manner.

\xE2\x80\x9CBah! Go aside!\xE2\x80\x9D said Monsieur Gabelle.

\xE2\x80\x9CLay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?\xE2\x80\x9D

The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some
half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and
presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as
a person plunges into the river.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSee to it, Gabelle. Go on!\xE2\x80\x9D

The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or
they might not have been so fortunate.

The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,
it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many
sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer
gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the
points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the
courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.

At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground,
with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor
figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had
studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was
dreadfully spare and thin.

To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She
turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and
presented herself at the carriage-door.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.\xE2\x80\x9D

With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,
Monseigneur looked out.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow, then! What is it? Always petitions!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He
cannot pay something?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAlas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor
grass.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAgain, well?\xE2\x80\x9D

She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate
grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together
with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly,
caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to
feel the appealing touch.

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of
want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAgain, well? Can I feed them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, the good God knows; but I don\xE2\x80\x99t ask it. My petition is,
that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband\xE2\x80\x99s name, may be placed
over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly
forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I
shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they
are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur!
Monseigneur!\xE2\x80\x9D

The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into
a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far
behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly
diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and
his chateau.

The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as
the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group
at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid
of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his
man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they
could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled
in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more
stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
been extinguished.

The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees,
was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged
for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door
of his chateau was opened to him.

\xE2\x80\x9CMonsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, not yet.\xE2\x80\x9D




IX. The Gorgon\xE2\x80\x99s Head


It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,
with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of
staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony
business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and
stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in
all directions. As if the Gorgon\xE2\x80\x99s head had surveyed it, when it was
finished, two centuries ago.

Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau
preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness
to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the
flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great
door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being
in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl\xE2\x80\x99s voice there was none,
save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of
those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then
heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.

The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a
hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;
grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a
peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord
was angry.

Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,
Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up
the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him
to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two
others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon
the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries
befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.
The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to
break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;
but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
pages in the history of France.

A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round
room, in one of the chateau\xE2\x80\x99s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small
lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds
closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy nephew,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; \xE2\x80\x9Cthey
said he was not arrived.\xE2\x80\x9D

Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the
table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.\xE2\x80\x9D

In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his
sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and
he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his
lips, when he put it down.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is that?\xE2\x80\x9D he calmly asked, looking with attention at the
horizontal lines of black and stone colour.

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur? That?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COutside the blinds. Open the blinds.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was done.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMonseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are
here.\xE2\x80\x9D

The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into
the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round
for instructions.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood,\xE2\x80\x9D said the imperturbable master. \xE2\x80\x9CClose them again.\xE2\x80\x9D

That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was
half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,
hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the
front of the chateau.

\xE2\x80\x9CAsk who is arrived.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind
Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance
rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.
He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.

He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and
there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came.
He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.

Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake
hands.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou left Paris yesterday, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D he said to Monseigneur, as he took his
seat at table.

\xE2\x80\x9CYesterday. And you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI come direct.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom London?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have been a long time coming,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis, with a smile.

\xE2\x80\x9COn the contrary; I come direct.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time
intending the journey.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been detained by\xE2\x80\x9D--the nephew stopped a moment in his
answer--\xE2\x80\x9Cvarious business.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWithout doubt,\xE2\x80\x9D said the polished uncle.

So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.
When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,
looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
fine mask, opened a conversation.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that
took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is
a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have
sustained me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot to death,\xE2\x80\x9D said the uncle; \xE2\x80\x9Cit is not necessary to say, to death.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI doubt, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the nephew, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether, if it had carried me to
the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.\xE2\x80\x9D

The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight
lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a
graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good
breeding that it was not reassuring.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued the nephew, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor anything I know, you may have
expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
circumstances that surrounded me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no, no,\xE2\x80\x9D said the uncle, pleasantly.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, however that may be,\xE2\x80\x9D resumed the nephew, glancing at him with
deep distrust, \xE2\x80\x9CI know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,
and would know no scruple as to means.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy friend, I told you so,\xE2\x80\x9D said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the
two marks. \xE2\x80\x9CDo me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI recall it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.

His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical
instrument.

\xE2\x80\x9CIn effect, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued the nephew, \xE2\x80\x9CI believe it to be at once your
bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in
France here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not quite understand,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.
\xE2\x80\x9CDare I ask you to explain?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not
been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would
have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is possible,\xE2\x80\x9D said the uncle, with great calmness. \xE2\x80\x9CFor the honour
of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
Pray excuse me!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before
yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,\xE2\x80\x9D observed the nephew.

\xE2\x80\x9CI would not say happily, my friend,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the uncle, with refined
politeness; \xE2\x80\x9CI would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for
consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence
your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,
at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle
aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that
might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest
and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted
(comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such
things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right
of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such
dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),
one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing
some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have
lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the
assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as
to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very
bad!\xE2\x80\x9D

The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;
as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
containing himself, that great means of regeneration.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern
time also,\xE2\x80\x9D said the nephew, gloomily, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I believe our name to be
more detested than any name in France.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet us hope so,\xE2\x80\x9D said the uncle. \xE2\x80\x9CDetestation of the high is the
involuntary homage of the low.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is not,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued the nephew, in his former tone, \xE2\x80\x9Ca face I can
look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA compliment,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis, \xE2\x80\x9Cto the grandeur of the family,
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.
Hah!\xE2\x80\x9D And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly
crossed his legs.

But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes
thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,
and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer\xE2\x80\x99s assumption of
indifference.

\xE2\x80\x9CRepression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear
and slavery, my friend,\xE2\x80\x9D observed the Marquis, \xE2\x80\x9Cwill keep the dogs
obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,\xE2\x80\x9D looking up to it, \xE2\x80\x9Cshuts
out the sky.\xE2\x80\x9D

That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the
chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to
him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof
he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new
way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.

\xE2\x80\x9CMeanwhile,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis, \xE2\x80\x9CI will preserve the honour and repose
of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we
terminate our conference for the night?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA moment more.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAn hour, if you please.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSir,\xE2\x80\x9D said the nephew, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits
of wrong.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_We_ have done wrong?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,
and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.

\xE2\x80\x9COur family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account
to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father\xE2\x80\x99s time, we did
a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and
our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father\xE2\x80\x99s time,
when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father\xE2\x80\x99s twin-brother, joint
inheritor, and next successor, from himself?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDeath has done that!\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd has left me,\xE2\x80\x9D answered the nephew, \xE2\x80\x9Cbound to a system that is
frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to
execute the last request of my dear mother\xE2\x80\x99s lips, and obey the last
look of my dear mother\xE2\x80\x99s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to
redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSeeking them from me, my nephew,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis, touching him on the
breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--\xE2\x80\x9Cyou
will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.\xE2\x80\x9D

Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was
cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking
quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he
touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of
a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the
body, and said,

\xE2\x80\x9CMy friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have
lived.\xE2\x80\x9D

When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his
box in his pocket.

\xE2\x80\x9CBetter to be a rational creature,\xE2\x80\x9D he added then, after ringing a small
bell on the table, \xE2\x80\x9Cand accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,
Monsieur Charles, I see.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis property and France are lost to me,\xE2\x80\x9D said the nephew, sadly; \xE2\x80\x9CI
renounce them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It
is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed
to me from you, to-morrow--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich I have the vanity to hope is not probable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C--or twenty years hence--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou do me too much honour,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis; \xE2\x80\x9Cstill, I prefer that
supposition.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to
relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHah!\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,
under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,
mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,
and suffering.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHah!\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better
qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the
weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave
it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in
another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse
on it, and on all this land.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you?\xE2\x80\x9D said the uncle. \xE2\x80\x9CForgive my curiosity; do you, under your new
philosophy, graciously intend to live?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at
their backs, may have to do some day--work.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn England, for example?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The
family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.\xE2\x80\x9D

The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be
lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The
Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his
valet.

\xE2\x80\x9CEngland is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there,\xE2\x80\x9D he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew
with a smile.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may
be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You
know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith a daughter?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Marquis. \xE2\x80\x9CYou are fatigued. Good night!\xE2\x80\x9D

As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy
in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,
which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same
time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin
straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that
looked handsomely diabolic.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the Marquis. \xE2\x80\x9CA Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So
commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!\xE2\x80\x9D

It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew
looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood night!\xE2\x80\x9D said the uncle. \xE2\x80\x9CI look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,\xE2\x80\x9D he
added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his
valet to his own bedroom.

The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his
loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still
night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no
noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose
periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just
coming on.

He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the
scraps of the day\xE2\x80\x99s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow
toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the
prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at
the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,
the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the
tall man with his arms up, crying, \xE2\x80\x9CDead!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am cool now,\xE2\x80\x9D said Monsieur the Marquis, \xE2\x80\x9Cand may go to bed.\xE2\x80\x9D

So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin
gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence
with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.

The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
hardly ever to say what is set down for them.

For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,
stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.
The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,
taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and
the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and
freed.

The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain
at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the
minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark
hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,
and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.

Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water
of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces
crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the
weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur
the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.
At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open
mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.

Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement
windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth
shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely
lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the
fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men
and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows
out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church
and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter
prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
foot.

The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and
surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been
reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;
now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked
round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs
pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.

All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the
return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the
chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried
figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?

What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already
at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day\xE2\x80\x99s dinner (not
much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow\xE2\x80\x99s while to
peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it
to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or
no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,
down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the
fountain.

All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about
in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other
emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought
in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly
on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of
the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was
highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated
into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting
himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,
and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind
a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle
(double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of
the German ballad of Leonora?

It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.

The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added
the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years.

It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine
mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the
heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt
was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:

\xE2\x80\x9CDrive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques.\xE2\x80\x9D




X. Two Promises


More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles
Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French
language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he
would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with
young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for
its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in
sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not
at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were
to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a
tutor, whose attainments made the student\xE2\x80\x99s way unusually pleasant and
profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became
known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the
circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.
So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.

In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor
to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he
would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and
did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.

A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek
and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in
London.

Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days
when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay\xE2\x80\x99s way--the way of the love of a
woman.

He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never
heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;
he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was
confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination
at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,
long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so
much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.

That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a
summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,
he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer
day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.

He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy
which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a
very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was
sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the
exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.

He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at
sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CCharles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your
return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were
both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,\xE2\x80\x9D he answered,
a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. \xE2\x80\x9CMiss
Manette--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs well,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, as he stopped short, \xE2\x80\x9Cand your return will
delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will
soon be home.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her
being from home, to beg to speak to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

There was a blank silence.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes?\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \xE2\x80\x9CBring your chair here,
and speak on.\xE2\x80\x9D

He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less
easy.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,\xE2\x80\x9D
 so he at length began, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor some year and a half, that I hope the topic
on which I am about to touch may not--\xE2\x80\x9D

He was stayed by the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s putting out his hand to stop him. When he
had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:

\xE2\x80\x9CIs Lucie the topic?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor
Manette!\xE2\x80\x9D he said deferentially.

There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\xE2\x80\x9D

His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it
originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles
Darnay hesitated.

\xE2\x80\x9CShall I go on, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

Another blank.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, go on.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly
I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and
the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,
disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love
her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!\xE2\x80\x9D

The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the
ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,
and cried:

\xE2\x80\x9CNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\xE2\x80\x9D

His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles
Darnay\xE2\x80\x99s ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had
extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter
so received it, and remained silent.

\xE2\x80\x9CI ask your pardon,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some
moments. \xE2\x80\x9CI do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or
raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair
overshadowed his face:

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you spoken to Lucie?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNor written?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is
to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks
you.\xE2\x80\x9D

He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darnay, respectfully, \xE2\x80\x9Chow can I fail to know, Doctor
Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so
belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it
can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there
is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could
hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that
in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to
you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I
have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a
little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you
with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as
long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even
now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.
Heaven is my witness that I love her!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe it,\xE2\x80\x9D answered her father, mournfully. \xE2\x80\x9CI have thought so
before now. I believe it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, do not believe,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice
struck with a reproachful sound, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat if my fortune were so cast as
that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time
put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a
word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I
should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at
a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my
heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not
now touch this honoured hand.\xE2\x80\x9D

He laid his own upon it as he spoke.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like
you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like
you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide
with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to
come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.\xE2\x80\x9D

His touch still lingered on her father\xE2\x80\x99s hand. Answering the touch for a
moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of
his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that
occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank
you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have
you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNone. As yet, none.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
ascertain that, with my knowledge?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I
might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you seek any guidance from me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it
in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you seek any promise from me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do seek that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well
understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her
innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I
could retain no place in it against her love for her father.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor\xE2\x80\x99s
favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason,
Doctor Manette,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darnay, modestly but firmly, \xE2\x80\x9CI would not ask that
word, to save my life.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as
well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one
respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her
heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I ask, sir, if you think she is--\xE2\x80\x9D As he hesitated, her father
supplied the rest.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs sought by any other suitor?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is what I meant to say.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her father considered a little before he answered:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,
occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COr both,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darnay.

\xE2\x80\x9CI had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want
a promise from me. Tell me what it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own
part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will
bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you
may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against
me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The
condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
require, I will observe immediately.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI give the promise,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout any condition. I believe
your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I
believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties
between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me
that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.
If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--\xE2\x80\x9D

The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as
the Doctor spoke:

\xE2\x80\x9C--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,
new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility
thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her
sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me
than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk.\xE2\x80\x9D

So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange
his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou said something to me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile.
\xE2\x80\x9CWhat was it you said to me?\xE2\x80\x9D

He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a
condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:

\xE2\x80\x9CYour confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother\xE2\x80\x99s, is
not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and
why I am in England.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CStop!\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor of Beauvais.

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no
secret from you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CStop!\xE2\x80\x9D

For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for
another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay\xE2\x80\x99s lips.

\xE2\x80\x9CTell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie
should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you
promise?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWillingly.

\xE2\x80\x9CGive me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she
should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!\xE2\x80\x9D

It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and
darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for
Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his
reading-chair empty.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy father!\xE2\x80\x9D she called to him. \xE2\x80\x9CFather dear!\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his
bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at
his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her
blood all chilled, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat shall I do! What shall I do!\xE2\x80\x9D

Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at
his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of
her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down
together for a long time.

She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He
slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished
work, were all as usual.




XI. A Companion Picture


\xE2\x80\x9CSydney,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his
jackal; \xE2\x80\x9Cmix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before,
and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making
a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver\xE2\x80\x99s papers before the setting in
of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver
arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
bring grist to the mill again.

Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much
application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him
through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled
his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
intervals for the last six hours.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you mixing that other bowl of punch?\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver the portly, with
his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
his back.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather
surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_Do_ you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. And not for money. What do you say now?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t feel disposed to say much. Who is she?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGuess.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo I know her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGuess.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not going to guess, at five o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the morning, with my brains
frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask
me to dinner.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell then, I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting
posture. \xE2\x80\x9CSydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,
because you are such an insensible dog.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, \xE2\x80\x9Care such a
sensitive and poetical spirit--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCome!\xE2\x80\x9D rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, \xE2\x80\x9Cthough I don\xE2\x80\x99t prefer
any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still
I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a luckier, if you mean that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t mean that. I mean I am a man of more--more--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSay gallantry, while you are about it,\xE2\x80\x9D suggested Carton.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! I\xE2\x80\x99ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver,
inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, \xE2\x80\x9Cwho cares more to
be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
to be agreeable, in a woman\xE2\x80\x99s society, than you do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGo on,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney Carton.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; but before I go on,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying
way, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll have this out with you. You\xE2\x80\x99ve been at Doctor Manette\xE2\x80\x99s house
as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your
moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you,
Sydney!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to
be ashamed of anything,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Sydney; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou ought to be much obliged
to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou shall not get off in that way,\xE2\x80\x9D rejoined Stryver, shouldering the
rejoinder at him; \xE2\x80\x9Cno, Sydney, it\xE2\x80\x99s my duty to tell you--and I tell you
to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned
fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.

\xE2\x80\x9CLook at me!\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, squaring himself; \xE2\x80\x9CI have less need to make
myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.
Why do I do it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never saw you do it yet,\xE2\x80\x9D muttered Carton.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do it because it\xE2\x80\x99s politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I
get on.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou don\xE2\x80\x99t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,\xE2\x80\x9D
 answered Carton, with a careless air; \xE2\x80\x9CI wish you would keep to that. As
to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?\xE2\x80\x9D

He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have no business to be incorrigible,\xE2\x80\x9D was his friend\xE2\x80\x99s answer,
delivered in no very soothing tone.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have no business to be, at all, that I know of,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney Carton.
\xE2\x80\x9CWho is the lady?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, don\xE2\x80\x99t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable,
Sydney,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
for the disclosure he was about to make, \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause I know you don\xE2\x80\x99t mean
half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I
make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to
me in slighting terms.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI did?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly; and in these chambers.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend;
drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young
lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a
little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I
think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man\xE2\x80\x99s opinion of
a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
of mine, who had no ear for music.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
looking at his friend.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow you know all about it, Syd,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Stryver. \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t care about
fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to
please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She
will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,
and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her,
but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?\xE2\x80\x9D

Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy should I be
astonished?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou approve?\xE2\x80\x9D

Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy should I not approve?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said his friend Stryver, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou take it more easily than I fancied
you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would
be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your
ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had
enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I
feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to go to it (when he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t, he can stay away), and I feel
that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me
credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to
say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you
know; you really are in a bad way. You don\xE2\x80\x99t know the value of money,
you live hard, you\xE2\x80\x99ll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;
you really ought to think about a nurse.\xE2\x80\x9D

The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as
big as he was, and four times as offensive.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, let me recommend you,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Stryver, \xE2\x80\x9Cto look it in the face.
I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face,
you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of
you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women\xE2\x80\x99s society, nor
understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some
respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way,
or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day. That\xE2\x80\x99s the
kind of thing for _you_. Now think of it, Sydney.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll think of it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney.




XII. The Fellow of Delicacy


Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
fortune on the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s daughter, resolved to make her happiness known
to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental
debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as
well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange
at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it
and Hilary.

As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly
saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly
grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a
plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the
plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for
the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to
consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer
case could be.

Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal
proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to
Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present
himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.

Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,
while the bloom of the Long Vacation\xE2\x80\x99s infancy was still upon it.
Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet
on Saint Dunstan\xE2\x80\x99s side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way
along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have
seen how safe and strong he was.

His way taking him past Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, and he both banking at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s and
knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.
Stryver\xE2\x80\x99s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness
of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle
in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient
cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.
Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
under the clouds were a sum.

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Stryver. \xE2\x80\x9CHow do you do? I hope you are well!\xE2\x80\x9D

It was Stryver\xE2\x80\x99s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he
squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading
the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if
the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.

The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would
recommend under the circumstances, \xE2\x80\x9CHow do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do
you do, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner
of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s who shook
hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a
self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.

\xE2\x80\x9CCan I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Lorry, in his
business character.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I
have come for a private word.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed
to the House afar off.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the
desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to
be not half desk enough for him: \xE2\x80\x9CI am going to make an offer of myself
in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh dear me!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his
visitor dubiously.

\xE2\x80\x9COh dear me, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Stryver, drawing back. \xE2\x80\x9COh dear you, sir?
What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy meaning,\xE2\x80\x9D answered the man of business, \xE2\x80\x9Cis, of course, friendly and
appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,
my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.
Stryver--\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest
manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,
\xE2\x80\x9Cyou know there really is so much too much of you!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,
opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \xE2\x80\x9Cif I understand you,
Mr. Lorry, I\xE2\x80\x99ll be hanged!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
end, and bit the feather of a pen.

\xE2\x80\x9CD--n it all, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, staring at him, \xE2\x80\x9Cam I not eligible?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you\xE2\x80\x99re eligible!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CIf you say
eligible, you are eligible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAm I not prosperous?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Stryver.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd advancing?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you come to advancing you know,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be
able to make another admission, \xE2\x80\x9Cnobody can doubt that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?\xE2\x80\x9D demanded Stryver,
perceptibly crestfallen.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! I--Were you going there now?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CStraight!\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen I think I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t, if I was you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy?\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver. \xE2\x80\x9CNow, I\xE2\x80\x99ll put you in a corner,\xE2\x80\x9D forensically
shaking a forefinger at him. \xE2\x80\x9CYou are a man of business and bound to
have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t you go?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9CI wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that I should succeed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CD--n _me_!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Stryver, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut this beats everything.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry
Stryver.

\xE2\x80\x9CHere\xE2\x80\x99s a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_
a Bank,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver; \xE2\x80\x9Cand having summed up three leading reasons for
complete success, he says there\xE2\x80\x99s no reason at all! Says it with his
head on!\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and
when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of
causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young
lady, my good sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe
young lady. The young lady goes before all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, squaring his
elbows, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
present in question is a mincing Fool?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry,
reddening, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose
taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could
not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
this desk, not even Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s should prevent my giving him a piece of my
mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver\xE2\x80\x99s
blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;
Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in
no better state now it was his turn.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is what I mean to tell you, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CPray let there
be no mistake about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood
hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the
toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not
to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King\xE2\x80\x99s Bench
bar?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd all I can say of it is,\xE2\x80\x9D laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat
this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow understand me,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CAs a man of business, I am
not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of
business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried
Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and
of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have
spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I
may not be right?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot I!\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, whistling. \xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t undertake to find third
parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense
in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It\xE2\x80\x99s
new to me, but you are right, I dare say.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And
understand me, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, \xE2\x80\x9CI
will not--not even at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s--have it characterised for me by any
gentleman breathing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere! I beg your pardon!\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver.

\xE2\x80\x9CGranted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be
painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor
Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very
painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You
know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with
the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you
in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its
soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied
with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
best spared. What do you say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow long would you keep me in town?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the
evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen I say yes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver: \xE2\x80\x9CI won\xE2\x80\x99t go up there now, I am not so
hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look
in to-night. Good morning.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a
concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it
bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength
of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were
always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly
believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in
the empty office until they bowed another customer in.

The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to
swallow, he got it down. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd now,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Stryver, shaking his
forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, \xE2\x80\x9Cmy way
out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found
great relief. \xE2\x80\x9CYou shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr.
Stryver; \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll do that for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o\xE2\x80\x99clock,
Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of
the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was
altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of
bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. \xE2\x80\x9CI have been to
Soho.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo Soho?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. \xE2\x80\x9COh, to be sure! What am I
thinking of!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I have no doubt,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I was right in the
conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my
advice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI assure you,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I
am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father\xE2\x80\x99s
account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let
us say no more about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t understand you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CI dare say not,\xE2\x80\x9D rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and
final way; \xE2\x80\x9Cno matter, no matter.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it does matter,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry urged.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t; I assure you it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t. Having supposed that there was
sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is
not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is
done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have
repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish
aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been
a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am
glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing
for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could
have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not
proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means
certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to
that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and
giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you
will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,
I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,
and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;
you were right, it never would have done.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.
Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of
showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.
\xE2\x80\x9CMake the best of it, my dear sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver; \xE2\x80\x9Csay no more about it;
thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver
was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.




XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy


If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the
house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he
cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
pierced by the light within him.

And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,
and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night
he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no
transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture
in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time
brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,
into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known
him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that
neighbourhood.

On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal
that \xE2\x80\x9Che had thought better of that marrying matter\xE2\x80\x9D) had carried his
delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health
for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney\xE2\x80\x99s feet still trod
those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became
animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,
they took him to the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s door.

He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had
never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little
embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at
his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed
a change in it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What
is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to
live no better life?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGod knows it is a shame!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen why not change it?\xE2\x80\x9D

Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that
there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he
answered:

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall
sink lower, and be worse.\xE2\x80\x9D

He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The
table trembled in the silence that followed.

She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to
be so, without looking at her, and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CPray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of
what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,
it would make me very glad!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGod bless you for your sweet compassion!\xE2\x80\x9D

He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t be afraid to hear me. Don\xE2\x80\x99t shrink from anything I say. I am like
one who died young. All my life might have been.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am
sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSay of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the
mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget
it!\xE2\x80\x9D

She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair
of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
been holden.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the
love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,
poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been
conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would
bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,
disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have
no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot
be.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWithout it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall
you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your
confidence? I know this is a confidence,\xE2\x80\x9D she modestly said, after a
little hesitation, and in earnest tears, \xE2\x80\x9CI know you would say this to
no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?\xE2\x80\x9D

He shook his head.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very
little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that
you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not
been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this
home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had
died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that
I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from
old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I
have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off
sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all
a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,
but I wish you to know that you inspired it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite
undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the
weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,
heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in
its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no
service, idly burning away.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSince it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy
than you were before you knew me--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if
anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSince the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,
attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can
make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for
good, with you, at all?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come
here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,
the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;
and that there was something left in me at this time which you could
deplore and pity.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with
all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEntreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself,
and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let
me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life
was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there
alone, and will be shared by no one?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf that will be a consolation to you, yes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Carton,\xE2\x80\x9D she answered, after an agitated pause, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe secret is
yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you. And again, God bless you.\xE2\x80\x9D

He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.

\xE2\x80\x9CBe under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this
conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it
again. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In
the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and
shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made
to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried
in your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!\xE2\x80\x9D

He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so
sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept
down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he
stood looking back at her.

\xE2\x80\x9CBe comforted!\xE2\x80\x9D he said, \xE2\x80\x9CI am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An
hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn
but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any
wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I
shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be
what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make
to you, is, that you will believe this of me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will, Mr. Carton.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve
you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say
it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to
you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would
embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold
me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one
thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new
ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a
happy father\xE2\x80\x99s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright
beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is
a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!\xE2\x80\x9D

He said, \xE2\x80\x9CFarewell!\xE2\x80\x9D said a last \xE2\x80\x9CGod bless you!\xE2\x80\x9D and left her.




XIV. The Honest Tradesman


To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in
Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and
variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit
upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and
not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending
westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,
both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where
the sun goes down!

With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,
like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever
running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,
since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such
companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed
to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from
the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.

Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in
the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,
but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.

It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.
Cruncher must have been \xE2\x80\x9Cflopping\xE2\x80\x9D in some pointed manner, when an
unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his
attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
funeral, which engendered uproar.

\xE2\x80\x9CYoung Jerry,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s a
buryin\xE2\x80\x99.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHooroar, father!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Young Jerry.

The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched
his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat d\xE2\x80\x99ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey
to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for
_me_!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. \xE2\x80\x9CHim and his hooroars! Don\xE2\x80\x99t
let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D\xE2\x80\x99ye
hear?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI warn\xE2\x80\x99t doing no harm,\xE2\x80\x9D Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.

\xE2\x80\x9CDrop it then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher; \xE2\x80\x9CI won\xE2\x80\x99t have none of _your_ no
harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.\xE2\x80\x9D

His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing
round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach
there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were
considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position
appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble
surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and
incessantly groaning and calling out: \xE2\x80\x9CYah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!\xE2\x80\x9D
 with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.

Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he
always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance
excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it, brother? What\xE2\x80\x99s it about?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_I_ don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man. \xE2\x80\x9CSpies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!\xE2\x80\x9D

He asked another man. \xE2\x80\x9CWho is it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_I_ don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth
nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
greatest ardour, \xE2\x80\x9CSpies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!\xE2\x80\x9D

At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled
against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the
funeral of one Roger Cly.

\xE2\x80\x9CWas He a spy?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Cruncher.

\xE2\x80\x9COld Bailey spy,\xE2\x80\x9D returned his informant. \xE2\x80\x9CYaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey
Spi--i--ies!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, to be sure!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had
assisted. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve seen him. Dead, is he?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDead as mutton,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the other, \xE2\x80\x9Cand can\xE2\x80\x99t be too dead. Have \xE2\x80\x98em
out, there! Spies! Pull \xE2\x80\x98em out, there! Spies!\xE2\x80\x9D

The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,
that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the
suggestion to have \xE2\x80\x98em out, and to pull \xE2\x80\x98em out, mobbed the two vehicles
so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd\xE2\x80\x99s opening the coach
doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands
for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,
that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after
shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and
other symbolical tears.

These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a
crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.
They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being
much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and
the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers
was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from
the observation of Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, in the further corner of the mourning
coach.

The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.
The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the
hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under
close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended
by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a
popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional
ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his
bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to
that part of the procession in which he walked.

Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting
at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination
was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there
in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,
accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and
highly to its own satisfaction.

The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter
genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of
window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy
and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had
been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm
the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were
coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps
the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual
progress of a mob.

Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained
behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a
neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and
maturely considering the spot.

\xE2\x80\x9CJerry,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,
\xE2\x80\x9Cyou see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he
was a young \xE2\x80\x98un and a straight made \xE2\x80\x98un.\xE2\x80\x9D

Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned
himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his
station at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched
his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all
amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon
his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.

Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No
job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the
usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, I tell you where it is!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on
entering. \xE2\x80\x9CIf, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I
shall make sure that you\xE2\x80\x99ve been praying again me, and I shall work you
for it just the same as if I seen you do it.\xE2\x80\x9D

The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, you\xE2\x80\x99re at it afore my face!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of
angry apprehension.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am saying nothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, then; don\xE2\x80\x99t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.
You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Jerry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Jerry,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. \xE2\x80\x9CAh! It _is_
yes, Jerry. That\xE2\x80\x99s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,
but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general
ironical dissatisfaction.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou and your yes, Jerry,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his
bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his saucer. \xE2\x80\x9CAh! I think so. I believe you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are going out to-night?\xE2\x80\x9D asked his decent wife, when he took
another bite.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I go with you, father?\xE2\x80\x9D asked his son, briskly.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, you mayn\xE2\x80\x99t. I\xE2\x80\x99m a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That\xE2\x80\x99s
where I\xE2\x80\x99m going to. Going a fishing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don\xE2\x80\x99t it, father?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever you mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShall you bring any fish home, father?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I don\xE2\x80\x99t, you\xE2\x80\x99ll have short commons, to-morrow,\xE2\x80\x9D returned that
gentleman, shaking his head; \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s questions enough for you; I ain\xE2\x80\x99t a
going out, till you\xE2\x80\x99ve been long abed.\xE2\x80\x9D

He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in
conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than
he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest
person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a
professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd mind you!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher. \xE2\x80\x9CNo games to-morrow! If I, as a
honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none
of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring
on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
customer to you, if you don\xE2\x80\x99t. _I_\xE2\x80\x98m your Rome, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then he began grumbling again:

\xE2\x80\x9CWith your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don\xE2\x80\x99t
know how scarce you mayn\xE2\x80\x99t make the wittles and drink here, by your
flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_
your\xE2\x80\x99n, ain\xE2\x80\x99t he? He\xE2\x80\x99s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,
and not know that a mother\xE2\x80\x99s first duty is to blow her boy out?\xE2\x80\x9D

This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to
perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above
all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.

Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry
was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,
obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one
o\xE2\x80\x99clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,
took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought
forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other
fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him
in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,
extinguished the light, and went out.

Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the
court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the
door stood ajar all night.

Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
father\xE2\x80\x99s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,
walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his
honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not
gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and
the two trudged on together.

Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the
winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a
lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,
that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the
second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split
himself into two.

The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low
brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and
wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which
the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.
Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that
Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the
third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands
and knees.

It was now Young Jerry\xE2\x80\x99s turn to approach the gate: which he did,
holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking
in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!
and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard
that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church
tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not
creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to
fish.

They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.
Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful
striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,
with his hair as stiff as his father\xE2\x80\x99s.

But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not
only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They
were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a
screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were
strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the
earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what
it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to
wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he
made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.

He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,
it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable
to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt
upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him
and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to
shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it
was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boy\xE2\x80\x99s Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways
too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy
got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then
it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
his breast when he fell asleep.

From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after
daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the
family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry
inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the
ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the
bed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI told you I would,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJerry, Jerry, Jerry!\xE2\x80\x9D his wife implored.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou oppose yourself to the profit of the business,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jerry, \xE2\x80\x9Cand me
and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don\xE2\x80\x99t
you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI try to be a good wife, Jerry,\xE2\x80\x9D the poor woman protested, with tears.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it being a good wife to oppose your husband\xE2\x80\x99s business? Is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou hadn\xE2\x80\x99t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s enough for you,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Mr. Cruncher, \xE2\x80\x9Cto be the wife of a
honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
when he took to his trade or when he didn\xE2\x80\x99t. A honouring and obeying
wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious
woman? If you\xE2\x80\x99re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have
no more nat\xE2\x80\x99ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has
of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.\xE2\x80\x9D

The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in
the honest tradesman\xE2\x80\x99s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down
at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on
his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay
down too, and fell asleep again.

There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.
Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid
by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed
and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his
ostensible calling.

Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father\xE2\x80\x99s side
along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry
from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and
solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,
and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not
improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,
that fine morning.

\xE2\x80\x9CFather,\xE2\x80\x9D said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep
at arm\xE2\x80\x99s length and to have the stool well between them: \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat\xE2\x80\x99s a
Resurrection-Man?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, \xE2\x80\x9CHow
should I know?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought you knowed everything, father,\xE2\x80\x9D said the artless boy.

\xE2\x80\x9CHem! Well,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his
hat to give his spikes free play, \xE2\x80\x9Che\xE2\x80\x99s a tradesman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s his goods, father?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the brisk Young Jerry.

\xE2\x80\x9CHis goods,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, \xE2\x80\x9Cis a
branch of Scientific goods.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPersons\xE2\x80\x99 bodies, ain\xE2\x80\x99t it, father?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the lively boy.

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe it is something of that sort,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher.

\xE2\x80\x9COh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I\xE2\x80\x99m quite
growed up!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.
\xE2\x80\x9CIt depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop
your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and
there\xE2\x80\x99s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
for.\xE2\x80\x9D As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,
to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to
himself: \xE2\x80\x9CJerry, you honest tradesman, there\xE2\x80\x99s hopes wot that boy will
yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!\xE2\x80\x9D




XV. Knitting


There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
Defarge. As early as six o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over
measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No
vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur
Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in
the dregs of it.

This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been
early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun
on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early
brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and
slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could
not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These
were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,
and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy
looks.

Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop
was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the
threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see
only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of
wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced
and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.

A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in
at every place, high and low, from the king\xE2\x80\x99s palace to the criminal\xE2\x80\x99s
gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built
towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve
with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
a long way off.

Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was
high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a
mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered
the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and
flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had
followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though
the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood day, gentlemen!\xE2\x80\x9D said Monsieur Defarge.

It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited
an answering chorus of \xE2\x80\x9CGood day!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is bad weather, gentlemen,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, shaking his head.

Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down
their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy wife,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: \xE2\x80\x9CI have
travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half\xE2\x80\x99s journey out of Paris.
He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to
drink, my wife!\xE2\x80\x9D

A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the
mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,
and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near
Madame Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s counter. A third man got up and went out.

Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less
than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even
Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you finished your repast, friend?\xE2\x80\x9D he asked, in due season.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, thank you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could
occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.\xE2\x80\x9D

Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a
courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the
staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man
sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.

No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had
gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired
man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at
him through the chinks in the wall.

Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:

\xE2\x80\x9CJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness
encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.
Speak, Jacques Five!\xE2\x80\x9D

The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with
it, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CWhere shall I commence, monsieur?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCommence,\xE2\x80\x9D was Monsieur Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s not unreasonable reply, \xE2\x80\x9Cat the
commencement.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI saw him then, messieurs,\xE2\x80\x9D began the mender of roads, \xE2\x80\x9Ca year ago this
running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the
chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun
going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he
hanging by the chain--like this.\xE2\x80\x9D

Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which
he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been
the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village
during a whole year.

Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?

\xE2\x80\x9CNever,\xE2\x80\x9D answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.

Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?

\xE2\x80\x9CBy his tall figure,\xE2\x80\x9D said the mender of roads, softly, and with his
finger at his nose. \xE2\x80\x9CWhen Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,
\xE2\x80\x98Say, what is he like?\xE2\x80\x99 I make response, \xE2\x80\x98Tall as a spectre.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou should have said, short as a dwarf,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Jacques Two.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he
confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not
offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger,
standing near our little fountain, and says, \xE2\x80\x98To me! Bring that rascal!\xE2\x80\x99
My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is right there, Jacques,\xE2\x80\x9D murmured Defarge, to him who had
interrupted. \xE2\x80\x9CGo on!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood!\xE2\x80\x9D said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. \xE2\x80\x9CThe tall man
is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo matter, the number,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CHe is well hidden, but at last
he is unluckily found. Go on!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to
go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the
village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see
coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man
with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!\xE2\x80\x9D

With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his
elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.

\xE2\x80\x9CI stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any
spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I
see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and
that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun
going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that
their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.
Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves
with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near
to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would
be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as
on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!\xE2\x80\x9D

He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it
vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not
show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with
our eyes. \xE2\x80\x98Come on!\xE2\x80\x99 says the chief of that company, pointing to the
village, \xE2\x80\x98bring him fast to his tomb!\xE2\x80\x99 and they bring him faster. I
follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden
shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and
consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!\xE2\x80\x9D

He imitated the action of a man\xE2\x80\x99s being impelled forward by the
butt-ends of muskets.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They
laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,
but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into
the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,
and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the
darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!\xE2\x80\x9D

He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding
snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by
opening it again, Defarge said, \xE2\x80\x9CGo on, Jacques.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll the village,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low
voice, \xE2\x80\x9Cwithdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the
village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the
locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,
except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating
my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on
my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty
iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no
hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a
dead man.\xE2\x80\x9D

Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all
of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the
countryman\xE2\x80\x99s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One
and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on
his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally
intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding
over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge
standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the
light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to
him.

\xE2\x80\x9CGo on, Jacques,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks
at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a
distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work
of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all
faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards
the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They
whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be
executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing
that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say
that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?
It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CListen then, Jacques,\xE2\x80\x9D Number One of that name sternly interposed.
\xE2\x80\x9CKnow that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,
yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,
sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the
hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in
his hand.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd once again listen, Jacques!\xE2\x80\x9D said the kneeling Number Three:
his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a
strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither
food nor drink; \xE2\x80\x9Cthe guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,
and struck him blows. You hear?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hear, messieurs.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGo on then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CAgain; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,\xE2\x80\x9D resumed the
countryman, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he is brought down into our country to be executed on
the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper
that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the
father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a
parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed
with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds
which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be
poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,
that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man
says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?
I am not a scholar.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CListen once again then, Jacques!\xE2\x80\x9D said the man with the restless hand
and the craving air. \xE2\x80\x9CThe name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was
all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and
nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than
the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager
attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,
when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was
done--why, how old are you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThirty-five,\xE2\x80\x9D said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen
it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEnough!\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, with grim impatience. \xE2\x80\x9CLong live the Devil! Go
on.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;
even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday
night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.
Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by
the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the
water.\xE2\x80\x9D

The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,
and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.

\xE2\x80\x9CAll work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,
the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers
have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst
of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is
a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he
laughed.\xE2\x80\x9D He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,
from the corners of his mouth to his ears. \xE2\x80\x9COn the top of the gallows is
fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged
there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.\xE2\x80\x9D

They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,
on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the
spectacle.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw
water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have
I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to
bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,
across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,
messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!\xE2\x80\x9D

The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other
three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),
and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was
warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now
walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here
you see me!\xE2\x80\x9D

After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, \xE2\x80\x9CGood! You have acted
and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the
door?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery willingly,\xE2\x80\x9D said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the
top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.

The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to
the garret.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow say you, Jacques?\xE2\x80\x9D demanded Number One. \xE2\x80\x9CTo be registered?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo be registered, as doomed to destruction,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CMagnificent!\xE2\x80\x9D croaked the man with the craving.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe chateau, and all the race?\xE2\x80\x9D inquired the first.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe chateau and all the race,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CExtermination.\xE2\x80\x9D

The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, \xE2\x80\x9CMagnificent!\xE2\x80\x9D and began
gnawing another finger.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you sure,\xE2\x80\x9D asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat no embarrassment
can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is
safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always
be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJacques,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Defarge, drawing himself up, \xE2\x80\x9Cif madame my wife
undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose
a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her
own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in
Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,
to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.\xE2\x80\x9D

There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who
hungered, asked: \xE2\x80\x9CIs this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is
very simple; is he not a little dangerous?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe knows nothing,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge; \xE2\x80\x9Cat least nothing more than would
easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself
with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him
on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and
Court; let him see them on Sunday.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat?\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed the hungry man, staring. \xE2\x80\x9CIs it a good sign, that he
wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJacques,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge; \xE2\x80\x9Cjudiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her
to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish
him to bring it down one day.\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already
dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the
pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon
asleep.

Worse quarters than Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s wine-shop, could easily have been found
in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious
dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very
new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly
unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that
his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that
he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he
contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it
into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through
with it until the play was played out.

Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted
(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have
madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was
additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the
afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
see the carriage of the King and Queen.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou work hard, madame,\xE2\x80\x9D said a man near her.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Madame Defarge; \xE2\x80\x9CI have a good deal to do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you make, madame?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMany things.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor instance--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor instance,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Madame Defarge, composedly, \xE2\x80\x9Cshrouds.\xE2\x80\x9D

The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender
of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close
and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was
fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King
and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the
shining Bull\xE2\x80\x99s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary
intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,
Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of
ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,
terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull\xE2\x80\x99s Eye,
more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept
with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three
hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,
and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him
from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
pieces.

\xE2\x80\x9CBravo!\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a
patron; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are a good boy!\xE2\x80\x9D

The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of
having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are the fellow we want,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, in his ear; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou make
these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more
insolent, and it is the nearer ended.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHey!\xE2\x80\x9D cried the mender of roads, reflectively; \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s true.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThese fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would
stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than
in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath
tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot
deceive them too much.\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
confirmation.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs to you,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou would shout and shed tears for anything, if
it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTruly, madame, I think so. For the moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to
pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would
pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTruly yes, madame.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were
set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,
you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is true, madame.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have seen both dolls and birds to-day,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, with
a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;
\xE2\x80\x9Cnow, go home!\xE2\x80\x9D




XVI. Still Knitting


Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to
the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,
for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village
scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and
terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the
village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that
when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to
faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled
up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel
look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the
stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder
was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which
everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the
scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a
skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all
started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares
who could find a living there.

Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the
stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres
of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the
night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole
world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling
star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in
the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every
vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.

The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,
in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their
journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier
guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two
of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate
with, and affectionately embraced.

When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,
and they, having finally alighted near the Saint\xE2\x80\x99s boundaries, were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:

\xE2\x80\x9CSay then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy
commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he
can say, but he knows of one.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEh well!\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool
business air. \xE2\x80\x9CIt is necessary to register him. How do they call that
man?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is English.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo much the better. His name?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBarsad,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had
been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect
correctness.

\xE2\x80\x9CBarsad,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated madame. \xE2\x80\x9CGood. Christian name?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJohn.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJohn Barsad,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.
\xE2\x80\x9CGood. His appearance; is it known?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAge, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;
complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face
thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,
sinister.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEh my faith. It is a portrait!\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, laughing. \xE2\x80\x9CHe shall be
registered to-morrow.\xE2\x80\x9D

They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),
and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted
the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the
stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of
her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally
dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl
of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the
night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked
up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which
condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he
walked up and down through life.

The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a
neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s olfactory sense was
by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than
it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He
whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are fatigued,\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the
money. \xE2\x80\x9CThere are only the usual odours.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am a little tired,\xE2\x80\x9D her husband acknowledged.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a little depressed, too,\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, whose quick eyes had
never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for
him. \xE2\x80\x9COh, the men, the men!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut my dear!\xE2\x80\x9D began Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut my dear!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated madame, nodding firmly; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut my dear! You are
faint of heart to-night, my dear!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his
breast, \xE2\x80\x9Cit _is_ a long time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a long time,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated his wife; \xE2\x80\x9Cand when is it not a long time?
Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow long,\xE2\x80\x9D demanded madame, composedly, \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes it take to make and store
the lightning? Tell me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that
too.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt does not take a long time,\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor an earthquake to
swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the
earthquake?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA long time, I suppose,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything
before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not
seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.\xE2\x80\x9D

She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.

\xE2\x80\x9CI tell thee,\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthat although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and
coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it
is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world
that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider
the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with
more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock
you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy brave wife,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Defarge, standing before her with his head
a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and
attentive pupil before his catechist, \xE2\x80\x9CI do not question all this. But
it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,
it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEh well! How then?\xE2\x80\x9D demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there
were another enemy strangled.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.
\xE2\x80\x9CWe shall not see the triumph.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe shall have helped it,\xE2\x80\x9D returned madame, with her extended hand in
strong action. \xE2\x80\x9CNothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all
my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew
certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I
would--\xE2\x80\x9D

Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.

\xE2\x80\x9CHold!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with
cowardice; \xE2\x80\x9CI too, my dear, will stop at nothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim
and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.
When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the
time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her
little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains
out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene
manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.

Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she
now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her
usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not
drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,
and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell
dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies
out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they
themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met
the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they
thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.

A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she
felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her
rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.

It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the
customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the
wine-shop.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood day, madame,\xE2\x80\x9D said the new-comer.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood day, monsieur.\xE2\x80\x9D

She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:
\xE2\x80\x9CHah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black
hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,
thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister
expression! Good day, one and all!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a
mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame complied with a polite air.

\xE2\x80\x9CMarvellous cognac this, madame!\xE2\x80\x9D

It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame
Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,
however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The
visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity
of observing the place in general.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou knit with great skill, madame.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am accustomed to it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA pretty pattern too!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ think so?\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, looking at him with a smile.

\xE2\x80\x9CDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPastime,\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her
fingers moved nimbly.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot for use?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\xE2\x80\x9D said
madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of
coquetry, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll use it!\xE2\x80\x9D

It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be
decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two
men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,
catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of
looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.
Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there
one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,
but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a
poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and
unimpeachable.

\xE2\x80\x9C_John_,\xE2\x80\x9D thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,
and her eyes looked at the stranger. \xE2\x80\x9CStay long enough, and I shall knit
\xE2\x80\x98BARSAD\xE2\x80\x99 before you go.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have a husband, madame?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CChildren?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo children.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBusiness seems bad?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBusiness is very bad; the people are so poor.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs _you_ say,\xE2\x80\x9D madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an
extra something into his name that boded him no good.

\xE2\x80\x9CPardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.
Of course.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_I_ think?\xE2\x80\x9D returned madame, in a high voice. \xE2\x80\x9CI and my husband have
enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we
think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and
it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without
embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.\xE2\x80\x9D

The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did
not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,
stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame
Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.

\xE2\x80\x9CA bad business this, madame, of Gaspard\xE2\x80\x99s execution. Ah! the poor
Gaspard!\xE2\x80\x9D With a sigh of great compassion.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy faith!\xE2\x80\x9D returned madame, coolly and lightly, \xE2\x80\x9Cif people use knives
for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the
price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone
that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary
susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: \xE2\x80\x9CI believe there
is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor
fellow? Between ourselves.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs there?\xE2\x80\x9D asked madame, vacantly.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs there not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C--Here is my husband!\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge.

As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted
him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, \xE2\x80\x9CGood day,
Jacques!\xE2\x80\x9D Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood day, Jacques!\xE2\x80\x9D the spy repeated; with not quite so much
confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou deceive yourself, monsieur,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the keeper of the wine-shop.
\xE2\x80\x9CYou mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is all the same,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: \xE2\x80\x9Cgood
day!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood day!\xE2\x80\x9D answered Defarge, drily.

\xE2\x80\x9CI was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when
you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy
and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo one has told me so,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, shaking his head. \xE2\x80\x9CI know nothing
of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his
hand on the back of his wife\xE2\x80\x99s chair, looking over that barrier at the
person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would
have shot with the greatest satisfaction.

The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious
attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh
water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it
out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over
it.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?\xE2\x80\x9D
 observed Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested
in its miserable inhabitants.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHah!\xE2\x80\x9D muttered Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,\xE2\x80\x9D
 pursued the spy, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I have the honour of cherishing some interesting
associations with your name.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed!\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, with much indifference.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,
had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am
informed of the circumstances?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSuch is the fact, certainly,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge. He had had it conveyed
to him, in an accidental touch of his wife\xE2\x80\x99s elbow as she knitted and
warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was to you,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat his daughter came; and it was
from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown
monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of
Tellson and Company--over to England.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSuch is the fact,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CVery interesting remembrances!\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy. \xE2\x80\x9CI have known Doctor
Manette and his daughter, in England.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes?\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou don\xE2\x80\x99t hear much about them now?\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CIn effect,\xE2\x80\x9D madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little
song, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe never hear about them. We received the news of their safe
arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,
they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held
no correspondence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerfectly so, madame,\xE2\x80\x9D replied the spy. \xE2\x80\x9CShe is going to be married.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGoing?\xE2\x80\x9D echoed madame. \xE2\x80\x9CShe was pretty enough to have been married long
ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! You know I am English.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI perceive your tongue is,\xE2\x80\x9D returned madame; \xE2\x80\x9Cand what the tongue is, I
suppose the man is.\xE2\x80\x9D

He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best
of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the
end, he added:

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to
one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,
poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is
going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard
was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present
Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is
Mr. Charles Darnay. D\xE2\x80\x99Aulnais is the name of his mother\xE2\x80\x99s family.\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was
troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no
spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.

Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be
worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad
paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,
in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes
after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the
husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should
come back.

\xE2\x80\x9CCan it be true,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife
as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat he has
said of Ma\xE2\x80\x99amselle Manette?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs he has said it,\xE2\x80\x9D returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, \xE2\x80\x9Cit
is probably false. But it may be true.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it is--\xE2\x80\x9D Defarge began, and stopped.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it is?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated his wife.

\xE2\x80\x9C--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her
sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHer husband\xE2\x80\x99s destiny,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure,
\xE2\x80\x9Cwill take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is
to end him. That is all I know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange\xE2\x80\x9D--said
Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthat, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her
husband\xE2\x80\x99s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by
the side of that infernal dog\xE2\x80\x99s who has just left us?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CStranger things than that will happen when it does come,\xE2\x80\x9D answered
madame. \xE2\x80\x9CI have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here
for their merits; that is enough.\xE2\x80\x9D

She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently
took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.
Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its
disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very
shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.

In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned
himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came
to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame
Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like
her--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women
knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a
mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the
jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,
the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.

But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame
Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer
among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left
behind.

Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. \xE2\x80\x9CA
great woman,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Ca strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully
grand woman!\xE2\x80\x9D

Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and
the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as
the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another
darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing
pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into
thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a
wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty,
Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women who sat
knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around
a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,
counting dropping heads.




XVII. One Night


Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat
under the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder
radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still
seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.

Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening
for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are happy, my dear father?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CQuite, my child.\xE2\x80\x9D

They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it
was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in
both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this
time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the
love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles\xE2\x80\x99s love
for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by
the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and
self-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--\xE2\x80\x9D

Even as it was, she could not command her voice.

In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face
upon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of
the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and
its going.

\xE2\x80\x9CDearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,
quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will
ever interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your
own heart, do you feel quite certain?\xE2\x80\x9D

Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed, \xE2\x80\x9CQuite sure, my darling! More than that,\xE2\x80\x9D he
added, as he tenderly kissed her: \xE2\x80\x9Cmy future is far brighter, Lucie,
seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever
was--without it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I could hope _that_, my father!--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBelieve it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain
it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot
fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be
wasted--\xE2\x80\x9D

She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated
the word.

\xE2\x80\x9C--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the
natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,
how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy
with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
without Charles, having seen him; and replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been
Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I
should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have
cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him
refer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new
sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long
afterwards.

\xE2\x80\x9CSee!\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.
\xE2\x80\x9CI have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her
light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against
my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,
that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I
could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines
with which I could intersect them.\xE2\x80\x9D He added in his inward and pondering
manner, as he looked at the moon, \xE2\x80\x9CIt was twenty either way, I remember,
and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.\xE2\x80\x9D

The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,
deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had
been born alive, or the poor mother\xE2\x80\x99s shock had killed it. Whether it
was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my
imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it
was a son who would never know his father\xE2\x80\x99s story; who might even live
to weigh the possibility of his father\xE2\x80\x99s having disappeared of his own
will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of
me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have
cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married
to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a
blank.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have
brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and
the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence
have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and
leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her
image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held
her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.
But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of
sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another
and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than
that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you
have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?
I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
perplexed distinctions.\xE2\x80\x9D

His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.

\xE2\x80\x9CIn that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married
life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture
was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,
cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love
that was I.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd she showed me her children,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor of Beauvais, \xE2\x80\x9Cand
they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed
a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked
up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I
imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.
But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and
blessed her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless
me as fervently to-morrow?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night
for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great
happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the
happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.\xE2\x80\x9D

He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked
Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went into the
house.

There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.

Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only
three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles
was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.

So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.
But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came
downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,
beforehand.

All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay
asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his
hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the
shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;
then, leaned over him, and looked at him.

Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he
covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the
mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet,
resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be
beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.

She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that
she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his
sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once
more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves
of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved
in praying for him.




XVIII. Nine Days


The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the
closed door of the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s room, where he was speaking with Charles
Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.
Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of
reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,
but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should
have been the bridegroom.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd so,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,
and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,
pretty dress; \xE2\x80\x9Cand so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought
you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought
what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring
on my friend Mr. Charles!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou didn\xE2\x80\x99t mean it,\xE2\x80\x9D remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cand
therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CReally? Well; but don\xE2\x80\x99t cry,\xE2\x80\x9D said the gentle Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not crying,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross; \xE2\x80\x9C_you_ are.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI, my Pross?\xE2\x80\x9D (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her,
on occasion.)

\xE2\x80\x9CYou were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don\xE2\x80\x99t wonder at it. Such
a present of plate as you have made \xE2\x80\x98em, is enough to bring tears into
anybody\xE2\x80\x99s eyes. There\xE2\x80\x99s not a fork or a spoon in the collection,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I didn\xE2\x80\x99t cry over, last night after the box came, till
I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t see it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am highly gratified,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Cthough, upon my honour, I
had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man
speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there
might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all!\xE2\x80\x9D From Miss Pross.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the
gentleman of that name.

\xE2\x80\x9CPooh!\xE2\x80\x9D rejoined Miss Pross; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou were a bachelor in your cradle.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat
seems probable, too.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you were cut out for a bachelor,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cbefore you
were put in your cradle.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, I think,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I was very unhandsomely dealt
with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,\xE2\x80\x9D drawing his arm soothingly round
her waist, \xE2\x80\x9CI hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and
I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave
your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your
own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next
fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s
shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at
the fortnight\xE2\x80\x99s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on
your other fortnight\xE2\x80\x99s trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent
him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear
Somebody\xE2\x80\x99s step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an
old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his
own.\xE2\x80\x9D

For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the
well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright
golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and
delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.

The door of the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s room opened, and he came out with Charles
Darnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they
went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.
But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the
shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold
wind.

He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot
which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in
another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange
eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.

Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
glanced on the bride\xE2\x80\x99s hand, which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s pockets. They returned home to
breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemaker\xE2\x80\x99s white locks in the Paris garret, were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the
door at parting.

It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father
cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her
enfolding arms, \xE2\x80\x9CTake her, Charles! She is yours!\xE2\x80\x9D

And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was
gone.

The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the
preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,
and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great
change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted
there, had struck him a poisoned blow.

He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been
expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was
the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent
manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the
wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.

\xE2\x80\x9CI think,\xE2\x80\x9D he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, \xE2\x80\x9CI
think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.
I must look in at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s; so I will go there at once and come back
presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine
there, and all will be well.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, than to look out of
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the
old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus
into the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood God!\xE2\x80\x9D he said, with a start. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s that?\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. \xE2\x80\x9CO me, O me! All is
lost!\xE2\x80\x9D cried she, wringing her hands. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is to be told to Ladybird?
He doesn\xE2\x80\x99t know me, and is making shoes!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the
Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent
down, and he was very busy.

\xE2\x80\x9CDoctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\xE2\x80\x9D

The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he
were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.

He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the
throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old
haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked
hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.

Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a
shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by
him, and asked what it was.

\xE2\x80\x9CA young lady\xE2\x80\x99s walking shoe,\xE2\x80\x9D he muttered, without looking up. \xE2\x80\x9CIt
ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, Doctor Manette. Look at me!\xE2\x80\x9D

He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in
his work.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper
occupation. Think, dear friend!\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at
a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract
a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and
words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on
the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that
he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.

Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above
all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;
the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In
conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a
few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been
called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post.

These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in
the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept
another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he
thought the best, on the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s case.

In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course
being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him
attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He
therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s for the
first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same
room.

He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that
attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the
window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.

Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,
that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour
after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.
When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose
and said to him:

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you go out?\xE2\x80\x9D

He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,
looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:

\xE2\x80\x9COut?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; for a walk with me. Why not?\xE2\x80\x9D

He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.
Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,
with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in
some misty way asking himself, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy not?\xE2\x80\x9D The sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.

Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him
at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long
time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he
fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his
bench and to work.

On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He
returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and
that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry
to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;
at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then
present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing
amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long
enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him.

When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Doctor, will you go out?\xE2\x80\x9D

As before, he repeated, \xE2\x80\x9COut?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; for a walk with me. Why not?\xE2\x80\x9D

This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the
meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had
sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s return, he
slipped away to his bench.

The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s hope darkened, and his
heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.
The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,
seven days, eight days, nine days.

With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and
heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was
well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to
observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,
was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on
his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in
the dusk of the ninth evening.




XIX. An Opinion


Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the
tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
night.

He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had
done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the
Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker\xE2\x80\x99s bench
and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading
at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which
Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly
studious and attentive.

Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his
friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed
as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of
which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?

It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the
answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?
How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor
Manette\xE2\x80\x99s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s bedroom door in the early morning?

Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he
had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have
resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.
He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.
Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.

Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked
out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical
toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual
white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the
usual way, and came to breakfast.

So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe
advance, he at first supposed that his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s marriage had taken
place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to
the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and
counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,
he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid
he sought. And that aid was his own.

Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the
Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a
very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is
very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less
so.\xE2\x80\x9D

Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the
Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced
at his hands more than once.

\xE2\x80\x9CDoctor Manette,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the
arm, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray
give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,
for his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s--his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s, my dear Manette.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I understand,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \xE2\x80\x9Csome mental
shock--?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBe explicit,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor. \xE2\x80\x9CSpare no detail.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,
of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,
the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a
shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how
long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there
are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from
which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace
himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is
the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to
be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and
great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his
stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,
there has been,\xE2\x80\x9D he paused and took a deep breath--\xE2\x80\x9Ca slight relapse.\xE2\x80\x9D

The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, \xE2\x80\x9COf how long duration?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNine days and nights.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow did it show itself? I infer,\xE2\x80\x9D glancing at his hands again, \xE2\x80\x9Cin the
resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is the fact.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, did you ever see him,\xE2\x80\x9D asked the Doctor, distinctly and
collectedly, though in the same low voice, \xE2\x80\x9Cengaged in that pursuit
originally?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnce.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all
respects--as he was then?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think in all respects.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.
It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.\xE2\x80\x9D

The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, \xE2\x80\x9CThat was very kind. That was
very thoughtful!\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of
the two spoke for a little while.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, my dear Manette,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most
considerate and most affectionate way, \xE2\x80\x9CI am a mere man of business,
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not
possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of
intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom
I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this
relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it
be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come
about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been
more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,
if I knew how.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I don\xE2\x80\x99t know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,
knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be
able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.
Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,
and teach me how to be a little more useful.\xE2\x80\x9D

Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and
Mr. Lorry did not press him.

\xE2\x80\x9CI think it probable,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthat the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite
unforeseen by its subject.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWas it dreaded by him?\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.

\xE2\x80\x9CVery much.\xE2\x80\x9D He said it with an involuntary shudder.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer\xE2\x80\x99s
mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force
himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWould he,\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Cbe sensibly relieved if he could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on
him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even
believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s arm again,
after a short silence on both sides, \xE2\x80\x9Cto what would you refer this
attack?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Doctor Manette, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that
there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations
would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a
particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWould he remember what took place in the relapse?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Lorry,
with natural hesitation.

The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and
answered, in a low voice, \xE2\x80\x9CNot at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, as to the future,\xE2\x80\x9D hinted Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs to the future,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, recovering firmness, \xE2\x80\x9CI should have
great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I
should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated
something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,
and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that
the worst was over.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, well! That\xE2\x80\x99s good comfort. I am thankful!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am thankful!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere are two other points,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Con which I am anxious to
be instructed. I may go on?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou cannot do your friend a better service.\xE2\x80\x9D The Doctor gave him his
hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does
he do too much?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in
singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in
part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy
things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
direction. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are sure that he is not under too great a strain?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think I am quite sure of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Manette, if he were overworked now--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a
violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CExcuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,
that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this
disorder?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not think so. I do not think,\xE2\x80\x9D said Doctor Manette with the
firmness of self-conviction, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat anything but the one train of
association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has
happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost
believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.\xE2\x80\x9D

He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that
confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
really was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to
be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning
conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the
last nine days, he knew that he must face it.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe
will call--Blacksmith\xE2\x80\x99s work, Blacksmith\xE2\x80\x99s work. We will say, to put a
case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad
time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by
him?\xE2\x80\x9D

The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot
nervously on the ground.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe has always kept it by him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at
his friend. \xE2\x80\x9CNow, would it not be better that he should let it go?\xE2\x80\x9D

Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the
ground.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou do not find it easy to advise me?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CI quite
understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--\xE2\x80\x9D And there he
shook his head, and stopped.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou see,\xE2\x80\x9D said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,
\xE2\x80\x9Cit is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings
of this poor man\xE2\x80\x99s mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved
his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more
practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental
torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of
himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind
of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not
find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may
fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.\xE2\x80\x9D

He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s
face.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business
who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and
bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go
with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the
forge?\xE2\x80\x9D

There was another silence.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou see, too,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, tremulously, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is such an old
companion.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI would not keep it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained
in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. \xE2\x80\x9CI would recommend him to
sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.
Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s
sake, my dear Manette!\xE2\x80\x9D

Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!

\xE2\x80\x9CIn her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take
it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there;
let him miss his old companion after an absence.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They
passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the
three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth
day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that
had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously
explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and
she had no suspicions.

On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into
his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross
carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and
guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker\xE2\x80\x99s bench to pieces, while
Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for
which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The
burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,
shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross,
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible
crime.




XX. A Plea


When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to
offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at home
many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or
in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.

He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of
speaking to him when no one overheard.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darnay,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, \xE2\x80\x9CI wish we might be friends.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe are already friends, I hope.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don\xE2\x80\x99t
mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be
friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.\xE2\x80\x9D

Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and
good-fellowship, what he did mean?

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my life,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, smiling, \xE2\x80\x9CI find that easier to comprehend
in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try. You
remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than
usual?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that
you had been drinking.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I
always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day,
when all days are at an end for me! Don\xE2\x80\x99t be alarmed; I am not going to
preach.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming
to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that
away. \xE2\x80\x9COn the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as
you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I
wish you would forget it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI forgot it long ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to
me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,
and a light answer does not help me to forget it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it was a light answer,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Darnay, \xE2\x80\x9CI beg your forgiveness
for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my
surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the
faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good
Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important to
remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs to the great service,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, \xE2\x80\x9CI am bound to avow to you, when
you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I
don\xE2\x80\x99t know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind! I
say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou make light of the obligation,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Darnay, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I will not
quarrel with _your_ light answer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGenuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my purpose;
I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you know I am
incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If you doubt it,
ask Stryver, and he\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done
any good, and never will.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know that you \xE2\x80\x98never will.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could endure
to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent
reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be
permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might
be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the
resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of
furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I
doubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I
should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I
dare say, to know that I had it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you try?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have
indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think so, Carton, by this time.\xE2\x80\x9D

They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute
afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.

When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss
Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of
this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw
him as he showed himself.

He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found
her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe are thoughtful to-night!\xE2\x80\x9D said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, dearest Charles,\xE2\x80\x9D with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring
and attentive expression fixed upon him; \xE2\x80\x9Cwe are rather thoughtful
to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it, my Lucie?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to
ask it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?\xE2\x80\x9D

What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the
cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!

\xE2\x80\x9CI think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and
respect than you expressed for him to-night.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, my own? Why so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he does.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very
lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that
he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep
wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a painful reflection to me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Charles Darnay, quite
astounded, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this
of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things,
even magnanimous things.\xE2\x80\x9D

She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,
that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd, O my dearest Love!\xE2\x80\x9D she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her
head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, \xE2\x80\x9Cremember how strong
we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!\xE2\x80\x9D

The supplication touched him home. \xE2\x80\x9CI will always remember it, dear
Heart! I will remember it as long as I live.\xE2\x80\x9D

He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded
her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets,
could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops
of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of
that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not
have parted from his lips for the first time--

\xE2\x80\x9CGod bless her for her sweet compassion!\xE2\x80\x9D




XXI. Echoing Footsteps


A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where
the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and
companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in
the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of
years.

At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,
when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be
dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,
afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.
Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:
doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided
her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of
footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would
be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her
eyes, and broke like waves.

That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the
advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of
her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young
mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and
the shady house was sunny with a child\xE2\x80\x99s laugh, and the Divine friend of
children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take
her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred
joy to her.

Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,
weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all
their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the
echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband\xE2\x80\x99s
step was strong and prosperous among them; her father\xE2\x80\x99s firm and equal.
Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an
unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the
plane-tree in the garden!

Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not
harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a
pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant
smile, \xE2\x80\x9CDear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to
leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!\xE2\x80\x9D those were not
tears all of agony that wetted his young mother\xE2\x80\x99s cheek, as the spirit
departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and
forbid them not. They see my Father\xE2\x80\x99s face. O Father, blessed words!

Thus, the rustling of an Angel\xE2\x80\x99s wings got blended with the other
echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath
of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were
mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed
murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as
the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or
dressing a doll at her mother\xE2\x80\x99s footstool, chattered in the tongues of
the Two Cities that were blended in her life.

The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some
half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once
done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing
regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages.

No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a
blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother,
but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive
delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in
such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton
was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,
and he kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of
him, almost at the last. \xE2\x80\x9CPoor Carton! Kiss him for me!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine
forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in
his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped
life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made
it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his
state of lion\xE2\x80\x99s jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with
property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them
but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.

These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most
offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three
sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to
Lucie\xE2\x80\x99s husband: delicately saying \xE2\x80\x9CHalloa! here are three lumps of
bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!\xE2\x80\x9D The polite
rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.
Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the
training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the
pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of
declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts
Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to \xE2\x80\x9Ccatch\xE2\x80\x9D him, and on the
diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him \xE2\x80\x9Cnot
to be caught.\xE2\x80\x9D Some of his King\xE2\x80\x99s Bench familiars, who were occasionally
parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the
latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed
it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender\xE2\x80\x99s being carried
off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.

These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes
amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little
daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her
child\xE2\x80\x99s tread came, and those of her own dear father\xE2\x80\x99s, always active
and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband\xE2\x80\x99s, need not be told.
Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself
with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet
in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her
more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the
many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is
the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,
as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to
have too much to do?\xE2\x80\x9D

But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly
in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about
little Lucie\xE2\x80\x99s sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,
as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.

On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.
Lorry came in late, from Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, and sat himself down by Lucie and
her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were
all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the
lightning from the same place.

\xE2\x80\x9CI began to think,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat
I should have to pass the night at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s. We have been so full of
business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way
to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a
run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able
to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania
among some of them for sending it to England.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat has a bad look,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darnay--

\xE2\x80\x9CA bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don\xE2\x80\x99t know what reason
there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s are
getting old, and we really can\xE2\x80\x99t be troubled out of the ordinary course
without due occasion.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CStill,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darnay, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know that, to be sure,\xE2\x80\x9D assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade
himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I
am determined to be peevish after my long day\xE2\x80\x99s botheration. Where is
Manette?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHere he is,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by
which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without
reason. You are not going out, I hope?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,\xE2\x80\x9D said the
Doctor.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be
pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can\xE2\x80\x99t
see.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf course, it has been kept for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd sleeping soundly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s right; all safe and well! I don\xE2\x80\x99t know why anything should be
otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out
all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank ye. Now,
come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear
the echoes about which you have your theory.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot a theory; it was a fancy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA fancy, then, my wise pet,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. \xE2\x80\x9CThey
are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!\xE2\x80\x9D

Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody\xE2\x80\x99s
life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the
footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in
the dark London window.

Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows
heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy
heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous
roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms
struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind:
all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a
weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.

Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what
agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the
heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could
have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges,
powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every
weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who
could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to
force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and
heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented
with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.

As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging
circled round Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron
had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,
already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,
thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm
another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.

\xE2\x80\x9CKeep near to me, Jacques Three,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Defarge; \xE2\x80\x9Cand do you, Jacques
One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these
patriots as you can. Where is my wife?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEh, well! Here you see me!\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, composed as ever, but not
knitting to-day. Madame\xE2\x80\x99s resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,
in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol
and a cruel knife.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere do you go, my wife?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI go,\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, \xE2\x80\x9Cwith you at present. You shall see me at the head
of women, by-and-bye.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, then!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. \xE2\x80\x9CPatriots and
friends, we are ready! The Bastille!\xE2\x80\x9D

With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped
into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on
depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums
beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack
began.

Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great
towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through
the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against
a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the
wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.

Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers,
cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! \xE2\x80\x9CWork, comrades
all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques
Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all
the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!\xE2\x80\x9D Thus Defarge of the
wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo me, women!\xE2\x80\x9D cried madame his wife. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat! We can kill as well as
the men when the place is taken!\xE2\x80\x9D And to her, with a shrill thirsty
cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and
revenge.

Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single
drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight
displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing
weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work
at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,
execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the
furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the
single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great
towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot
by the service of Four fierce hours.

A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly
perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly
the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the
wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer
walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!

So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to
draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been
struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the
outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he
made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his side;
Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the
inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was tumult,
exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet
furious dumb-show.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe Prisoners!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe Records!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe secret cells!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe instruments of torture!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe Prisoners!\xE2\x80\x9D

Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Prisoners!\xE2\x80\x9D was
the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an
eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost
billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and
threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of
these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his
hand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the
wall.

\xE2\x80\x9CShow me the North Tower!\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CQuick!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will faithfully,\xE2\x80\x9D replied the man, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you will come with me. But
there is no one there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?\xE2\x80\x9D asked
Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CQuick!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe meaning, monsieur?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDoes it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean that I
shall strike you dead?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CKill him!\xE2\x80\x9D croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.

\xE2\x80\x9CMonsieur, it is a cell.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShow it me!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPass this way, then.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed
by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed,
held by Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s arm as he held by the turnkey\xE2\x80\x99s. Their three heads had
been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much
as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the
noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and
its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All around
outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,
occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the
air like spray.

Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past
hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,
and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry
waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three,
linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and
there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by;
but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a
tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls
and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible
to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had
come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.

The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung
the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed
in:

\xE2\x80\x9COne hundred and five, North Tower!\xE2\x80\x9D

There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,
with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by
stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred
across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes
on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were
the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.

\xE2\x80\x9CPass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Defarge to the turnkey.

The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.

\xE2\x80\x9CStop!--Look here, Jacques!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA. M.!\xE2\x80\x9D croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.

\xE2\x80\x9CAlexandre Manette,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge in his ear, following the letters
with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd here he
wrote \xE2\x80\x98a poor physician.\xE2\x80\x99 And it was he, without doubt, who scratched
a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it
me!\xE2\x80\x9D

He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden
exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and
table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.

\xE2\x80\x9CHold the light higher!\xE2\x80\x9D he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. \xE2\x80\x9CLook
among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,\xE2\x80\x9D
 throwing it to him; \xE2\x80\x9Crip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the
light higher, you!\xE2\x80\x9D

With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and,
peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar,
and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar
and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and
in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney
into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a
cautious touch.

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light
them, you!\xE2\x80\x9D

The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping
again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and
retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense
of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once
more.

They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint
Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard
upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people.
Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for
judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people\xE2\x80\x99s
blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be
unavenged.

In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red
decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a
woman\xE2\x80\x99s. \xE2\x80\x9CSee, there is my husband!\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, pointing him out.
\xE2\x80\x9CSee Defarge!\xE2\x80\x9D She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and
remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through
the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable
close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to
be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the
long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him
when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot
upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head.

The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea
of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. Saint
Antoine\xE2\x80\x99s blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the
iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the
governor\xE2\x80\x99s body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge
where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. \xE2\x80\x9CLower
the lamp yonder!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new
means of death; \xE2\x80\x9Chere is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!\xE2\x80\x9D The
swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.

The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving
of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces
were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes,
voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering
until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.

But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was
in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so
fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore
more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly
released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high
overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last
Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.
Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose
drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive
faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them;
faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped
lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, \xE2\x80\x9CTHOU DIDST
IT!\xE2\x80\x9D

Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the
accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters
and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken
hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint
Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven
hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay,
and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad,
and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask
at Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once
stained red.




XXII. The Sea Still Rises


Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften
his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with
the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame
Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.
Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of
Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting
themselves to the saint\xE2\x80\x99s mercies. The lamps across his streets had a
portentously elastic swing with them.

Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,
contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several
knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense
of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on
the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: \xE2\x80\x9CI know how
hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;
but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to
destroy life in you?\xE2\x80\x9D Every lean bare arm, that had been without work
before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.
The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that
they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine;
the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the
last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.

Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was
to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her
sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a starved
grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had
already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.

\xE2\x80\x9CHark!\xE2\x80\x9D said The Vengeance. \xE2\x80\x9CListen, then! Who comes?\xE2\x80\x9D

As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine
Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading
murmur came rushing along.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is Defarge,\xE2\x80\x9D said madame. \xE2\x80\x9CSilence, patriots!\xE2\x80\x9D

Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked
around him! \xE2\x80\x9CListen, everywhere!\xE2\x80\x9D said madame again. \xE2\x80\x9CListen to him!\xE2\x80\x9D
 Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open
mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had
sprung to their feet.

\xE2\x80\x9CSay then, my husband. What is it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNews from the other world!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow, then?\xE2\x80\x9D cried madame, contemptuously. \xE2\x80\x9CThe other world?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDoes everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people
that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEverybody!\xE2\x80\x9D from all throats.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe news is of him. He is among us!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAmong us!\xE2\x80\x9D from the universal throat again. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd dead?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot dead! He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself
to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have
found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have
seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have
said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! _Had_ he reason?\xE2\x80\x9D

Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had
never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
could have heard the answering cry.

A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked
steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum
was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.

\xE2\x80\x9CPatriots!\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, in a determined voice, \xE2\x80\x9Care we ready?\xE2\x80\x9D

Instantly Madame Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating
in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and
The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about
her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to
house, rousing the women.

The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked
from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into
the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From
such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their
children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground
famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one
another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.
Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant
Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of
these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon
alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon
who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread
to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these
breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our
suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my
knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers,
and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,
Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend
Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from
him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,
whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they
dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men
belonging to them from being trampled under foot.

Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at
the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew
his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out
of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with
such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not
a human creature in Saint Antoine\xE2\x80\x99s bosom but a few old crones and the
wailing children.

No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where
this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent
open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,
and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance
from him in the Hall.

\xE2\x80\x9CSee!\xE2\x80\x9D cried madame, pointing with her knife. \xE2\x80\x9CSee the old villain bound
with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back.
Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!\xE2\x80\x9D Madame put her knife
under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.

The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of
her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to
others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the
clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,
and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s frequent
expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at
a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some
wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture
to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a
telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.

At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
protection, directly down upon the old prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s head. The favour was
too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had
stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got
him!

It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge
had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable
wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned
her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and
Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows
had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high
perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, \xE2\x80\x9CBring him
out! Bring him to the lamp!\xE2\x80\x9D

Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on
his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,
and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his
face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always
entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of
action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one
another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through
a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat
might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him
while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately
screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have
him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and the rope
broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope
broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and
held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the
mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.

Nor was this the end of the day\xE2\x80\x99s bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted
and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when
the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the
people\xE2\x80\x99s enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard
five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes
on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the
breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on
pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession
through the streets.

Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,
wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers\xE2\x80\x99 shops were beset by
long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them
again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and
slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in
common, afterwards supping at their doors.

Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and
hoped.

It was almost morning, when Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s wine-shop parted with its last
knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in
husky tones, while fastening the door:

\xE2\x80\x9CAt last it is come, my dear!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEh well!\xE2\x80\x9D returned madame. \xE2\x80\x9CAlmost.\xE2\x80\x9D

Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with
her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum\xE2\x80\x99s was the
only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The
Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had
the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon
was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint
Antoine\xE2\x80\x99s bosom.




XXIII. Fire Rises


There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where
the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the
crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,
but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of
them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not
be what he was ordered.

Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.
Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as
shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down,
dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated
animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn
out.

Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national
blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of
luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;
nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought
things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for
Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must
be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it
was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing
to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
unaccountable.

But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like
it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung
it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures
of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting
the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces
of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in
the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the
disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and
beautifying features of Monseigneur.

For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the
dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and
to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in
thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if
he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour,
and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on
foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now
a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern
without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian
aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many
highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled
with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.

Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,
as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he
could get from a shower of hail.

The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill,
and at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects
in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just
intelligible:

\xE2\x80\x9CHow goes it, Jacques?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll well, Jacques.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTouch then!\xE2\x80\x9D

They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo dinner?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing but supper now,\xE2\x80\x9D said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is the fashion,\xE2\x80\x9D growled the man. \xE2\x80\x9CI meet no dinner anywhere.\xE2\x80\x9D

He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and
steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held
it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and
thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.

\xE2\x80\x9CTouch then.\xE2\x80\x9D It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo-night?\xE2\x80\x9D said the mender of roads.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo-night,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHere.\xE2\x80\x9D

He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at
one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge
of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.

\xE2\x80\x9CShow me!\xE2\x80\x9D said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.

\xE2\x80\x9CSee!\xE2\x80\x9D returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. \xE2\x80\x9CYou go down
here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo the Devil with all that!\xE2\x80\x9D interrupted the other, rolling his eye
over the landscape. \xE2\x80\x9C_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains.
Well?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
village.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood. When do you cease to work?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt sunset.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without
resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. Will you
wake me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSurely.\xE2\x80\x9D

The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his
great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. He
was fast asleep directly.

As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling
away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to
by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap
now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the
heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used
his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.
The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen
red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of
beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen
and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender
of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were
footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed
with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long
leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into
sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at
secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept
with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.
Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and
drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against
this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and
looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no
obstacle, tending to centres all over France.

The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps
of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,
the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
to go down into the village, roused him.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood!\xE2\x80\x9D said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. \xE2\x80\x9CTwo leagues beyond the
summit of the hill?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAbout.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAbout. Good!\xE2\x80\x9D

The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him
according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,
squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and
appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.
When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,
as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A
curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered
together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of
looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,
chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top
alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his
chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to
the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need
to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.

The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its
solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened
the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace
flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a
swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through
the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the
stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis
had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four
heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four
lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all
was black again.

But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely
visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.
Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,
picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,
and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.
Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the
stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.

A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was
spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the
space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur
Gabelle\xE2\x80\x99s door. \xE2\x80\x9CHelp, Gabelle! Help, every one!\xE2\x80\x9D The tocsin rang
impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The
mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood
with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the
sky. \xE2\x80\x9CIt must be forty feet high,\xE2\x80\x9D said they, grimly; and never moved.

The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away
through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on
the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;
removed from them, a group of soldiers. \xE2\x80\x9CHelp, gentlemen--officers! The
chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by
timely aid! Help, help!\xE2\x80\x9D The officers looked towards the soldiers who
looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting
of lips, \xE2\x80\x9CIt must burn.\xE2\x80\x9D

As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the
village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and
fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in
every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,
occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on
that functionary\xE2\x80\x99s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to
authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,
and that post-horses would roast.

The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and
raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the
infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising
and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in
torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the
two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke
again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake
and contending with the fire.

The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,
scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce
figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten
lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran
dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the
heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and
splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied
birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures
trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded
roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next
destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,
abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.

Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment
of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter
days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his
house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,
Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel
with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again
withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time
resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man
of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the
parapet, and crush a man or two below.

Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the
distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,
combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an
ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,
which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.
A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur
Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the
rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,
and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that
while.

Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were
other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom
the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they
had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the
functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up
in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,
North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.
The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,
no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate
successfully.




XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock


In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by
the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the
flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on
the shore--three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays
of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful
tissue of the life of her home.

Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in
the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of
a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted
in.

Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of
his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as
to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and
this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with
infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could
ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after
boldly reading the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer backwards for a great number of years,
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no
sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.

The shining Bull\xE2\x80\x99s Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the
mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good
eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer\xE2\x80\x99s pride,
Sardanapalus\xE2\x80\x99s luxury, and a mole\xE2\x80\x99s blindness--but it had dropped
out and was gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its
outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was
all gone together. Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and
\xE2\x80\x9Csuspended,\xE2\x80\x9D when the last tidings came over.

The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was
come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.

As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of
Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank. Spirits are supposed to
haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur
without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be.
Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most
to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s was a munificent
house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming
storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made
provident remittances to Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, were always to be heard of there
by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer
from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, almost as
a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s was at that
time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this
was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in
consequence so numerous, that Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s sometimes wrote the latest news
out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran
through Temple Bar to read.

On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles
Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The
penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now
the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an
hour or so of the time of closing.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,\xE2\x80\x9D said Charles
Darnay, rather hesitating, \xE2\x80\x9CI must still suggest to you--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI understand. That I am too old?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CUnsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a
disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Charles,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou touch
some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe
enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard
upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth
interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a
disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our
House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of
old, and is in Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the
long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit
myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, after all
these years, who ought to be?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish I were going myself,\xE2\x80\x9D said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly,
and like one thinking aloud.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Mr.
Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CYou wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman born? You
are a wise counsellor.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the
thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through
my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for
the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them,\xE2\x80\x9D he spoke
here in his former thoughtful manner, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat one might be listened to,
and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night,
after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen you were talking to Lucie,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry repeated. \xE2\x80\x9CYes. I wonder you
are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to
France at this time of day!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHowever, I am not going,\xE2\x80\x9D said Charles Darnay, with a smile. \xE2\x80\x9CIt is
more to the purpose that you say you are.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry
glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou can have no
conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and
of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The
Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers
of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they
might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set
afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these
with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise
getting of them out of harm\xE2\x80\x99s way, is within the power (without loss of
precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall
I hang back, when Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s knows this and says this--Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, whose
bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about
the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, glancing at
the House again, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are to remember, that getting things out of
Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an
impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought
to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to
whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine,
every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed
the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily
as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do you really go to-night?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of
delay.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do you take no one with you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing
to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my
bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.
Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or
of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
master.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and
youthfulness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little
commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s proposal to retire and
live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old.\xE2\x80\x9D

This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s usual desk, with
Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he
would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too
much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it
was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this
terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under
the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or
omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched
millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that
should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming,
years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such
vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the
restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,
and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured
without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was
such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood
in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had
already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.

Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King\xE2\x80\x99s Bench Bar, far on his
way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching
to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition
of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard
with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between
going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his
word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.

The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter
before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to
whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay
that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right
name. The address, turned into English, ran:

\xE2\x80\x9CVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of
France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,
London, England.\xE2\x80\x9D

On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and
express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should
be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate
between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no
suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; \xE2\x80\x9CI have referred it,
I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this
gentleman is to be found.\xE2\x80\x9D

The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there
was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s desk. He
held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the
person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at
it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,
and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in
English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.

\xE2\x80\x9CNephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the
polished Marquis who was murdered,\xE2\x80\x9D said one. \xE2\x80\x9CHappy to say, I never
knew him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA craven who abandoned his post,\xE2\x80\x9D said another--this Monseigneur had
been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of
hay--\xE2\x80\x9Csome years ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CInfected with the new doctrines,\xE2\x80\x9D said a third, eyeing the direction
through his glass in passing; \xE2\x80\x9Cset himself in opposition to the last
Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to
the ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHey?\xE2\x80\x9D cried the blatant Stryver. \xE2\x80\x9CDid he though? Is that the sort of
fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!\xE2\x80\x9D

Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on
the shoulder, and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI know the fellow.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you, by Jupiter?\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver. \xE2\x80\x9CI am sorry for it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, Mr. Darnay? D\xE2\x80\x99ye hear what he did? Don\xE2\x80\x99t ask, why, in these
times.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I do ask why?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to
hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,
who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that
ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth
that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a
man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I\xE2\x80\x99ll answer you. I am sorry
because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That\xE2\x80\x99s
why.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and
said: \xE2\x80\x9CYou may not understand the gentleman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay,\xE2\x80\x9D said Bully
Stryver, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I\xE2\x80\x99ll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don\xE2\x80\x99t_
understand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also
tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position
to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no,
gentlemen,\xE2\x80\x9D said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers,
\xE2\x80\x9CI know something of human nature, and I tell you that you\xE2\x80\x99ll never
find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such
precious _prot\xC3\xA9g\xC3\xA9s_. No, gentlemen; he\xE2\x80\x99ll always show \xE2\x80\x98em a clean pair
of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.\xE2\x80\x9D

With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver
shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of
his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk,
in the general departure from the Bank.

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you take charge of the letter?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CYou know where to
deliver it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been
addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and
that it has been here some time?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom here, at eight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will come back, to see you off.\xE2\x80\x9D

Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,
Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the
letter, and read it. These were its contents:


\xE2\x80\x9CPrison of the Abbaye, Paris.

\xE2\x80\x9CJune 21, 1792. \xE2\x80\x9CMONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.

\xE2\x80\x9CAfter having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the
village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and
brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a
great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the
ground.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my
life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against
the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an
emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not
against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that,
before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the
imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had
had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for
an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that
emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will he
not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your
ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!

\xE2\x80\x9CFor the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to
succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh
Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and
nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the
assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.

\xE2\x80\x9CYour afflicted,

\xE2\x80\x9CGabelle.\xE2\x80\x9D


The latent uneasiness in Darnay\xE2\x80\x99s mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose
only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so
reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple
considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.

He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his
conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,
he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,
his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own
mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to
do it, and that it had never been done.

The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being
always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time
which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week
annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week
following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of
these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still
without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched
the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled
until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from
France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of
confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out,
was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
France that might impeach him for it.

But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so
far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had
relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own
bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little
there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his
own safety, so that it could not but appear now.

This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make,
that he would go to Paris.

Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven
him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him
to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted
him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible
attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who
could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,
trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching
him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison
(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,
which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were
coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle\xE2\x80\x99s
letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his
justice, honour, and good name.

His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.

Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he
struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention
with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left
it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert
it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the
sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even
saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.

As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that
neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone.
Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always
reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old,
should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in
the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his
situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety
to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not
discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence
in his course.

He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to
return to Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived
in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say
nothing of his intention now.

A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was
booted and equipped.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have delivered that letter,\xE2\x80\x9D said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CI
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but
perhaps you will take a verbal one?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat I will, and readily,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Cif it is not dangerous.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is his name?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his
hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CGabelle.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSimply, \xE2\x80\x98that he has received the letter, and will come.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAny time mentioned?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe will start upon his journey to-morrow night.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAny person mentioned?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,
and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the
misty air of Fleet-street. \xE2\x80\x9CMy love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Mr. Lorry at parting, \xE2\x80\x9Cand take precious care of them till I come back.\xE2\x80\x9D
 Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage
rolled away.

That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote
two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation
he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons
that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and
their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters
in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.

It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first
reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to
preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious.
But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him
resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,
so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and
the day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her
scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye
(an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise
of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
streets, with a heavier heart.

The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides
and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left his
two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before
midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.
\xE2\x80\x9CFor the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
your noble name!\xE2\x80\x9D was the poor prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s cry with which he strengthened
his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and
floated away for the Loadstone Rock.


The end of the second book.





Book the Third--the Track of a Storm




I. In Secret


The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from
England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and
ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad
horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and
unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;
but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than
these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of
citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state
of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them,
inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own,
turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in
hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning
Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or
Death.

A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles
Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there
was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen
at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey\xE2\x80\x99s end.
Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across
the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in
the series that was barred between him and England. The universal
watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net,
or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have
felt his freedom more completely gone.

This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by
riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him
by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been
days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in
a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.

Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle\xE2\x80\x99s letter from his
prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the
guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as
a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.

Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.

\xE2\x80\x9CEmigrant,\xE2\x80\x9D said the functionary, \xE2\x80\x9CI am going to send you on to Paris,
under an escort.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCitizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could
dispense with the escort.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSilence!\xE2\x80\x9D growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end
of his musket. \xE2\x80\x9CPeace, aristocrat!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is as the good patriot says,\xE2\x80\x9D observed the timid functionary. \xE2\x80\x9CYou
are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have no choice,\xE2\x80\x9D said Charles Darnay.

\xE2\x80\x9CChoice! Listen to him!\xE2\x80\x9D cried the same scowling red-cap. \xE2\x80\x9CAs if it was
not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is always as the good patriot says,\xE2\x80\x9D observed the functionary. \xE2\x80\x9CRise
and dress yourself, emigrant.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by
a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he
started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the morning.

The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured
cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either
side of him.

The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to
his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his
wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,
and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without
change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay
between them and the capital.

They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and
lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed,
that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying
his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,
he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,
confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.

But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,
when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from
himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd
gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called
out loudly, \xE2\x80\x9CDown with the emigrant!\xE2\x80\x9D

He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,
resuming it as his safest place, said:

\xE2\x80\x9CEmigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own
will?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a cursed emigrant,\xE2\x80\x9D cried a farrier, making at him in a
furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; \xE2\x80\x9Cand you are a cursed
aristocrat!\xE2\x80\x9D

The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider\xE2\x80\x99s
bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, \xE2\x80\x9CLet him
be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJudged!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. \xE2\x80\x9CAy! and condemned
as a traitor.\xE2\x80\x9D At this the crowd roared approval.

Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse\xE2\x80\x99s head to the
yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with
the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his
voice heard:

\xE2\x80\x9CFriends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a
traitor.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe lies!\xE2\x80\x9D cried the smith. \xE2\x80\x9CHe is a traitor since the decree. His life
is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!\xE2\x80\x9D

At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which
another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his
horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse\xE2\x80\x99s flanks,
and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier
struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no
more was done.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is this decree that the smith spoke of?\xE2\x80\x9D Darnay asked the
postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.

\xE2\x80\x9CTruly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen passed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COn the fourteenth.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe day I left England!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEverybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be
others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and
condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said
your life was not your own.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut there are no such decrees yet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do I know!\xE2\x80\x9D said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; \xE2\x80\x9Cthere
may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?\xE2\x80\x9D

They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and
then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many
wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and
lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor
cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and
would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn
up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in
Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and
wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by
the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their
way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.

Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere are the papers of this prisoner?\xE2\x80\x9D demanded a resolute-looking man
in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.

Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen,
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him
whatever, \xE2\x80\x9Care the papers of this prisoner?\xE2\x80\x9D

The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his
eyes over Gabelle\xE2\x80\x99s letter, the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.

He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went
into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the
gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles
Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress
into the city for peasants\xE2\x80\x99 carts bringing in supplies, and for similar
traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest
people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not
to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue
forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they
filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew
their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the
ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered
about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men
and women.

When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these
things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,
who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the
escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him
to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,
turned and rode away without entering the city.

He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine
and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,
drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and
waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The
light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of
the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly
uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an
officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.

\xE2\x80\x9CCitizen Defarge,\xE2\x80\x9D said he to Darnay\xE2\x80\x99s conductor, as he took a slip of
paper to write on. \xE2\x80\x9CIs this the emigrant Evremonde?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is the man.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour age, Evremonde?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThirty-seven.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMarried, Evremonde?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere married?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn England.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWithout doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn England.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWithout doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La
Force.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJust Heaven!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Darnay. \xE2\x80\x9CUnder what law, and for what offence?\xE2\x80\x9D

The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here.\xE2\x80\x9D He
said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.

\xE2\x80\x9CI entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response
to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I
demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that
my right?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEmigrants have no rights, Evremonde,\xE2\x80\x9D was the stolid reply. The officer
wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,
sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words \xE2\x80\x9CIn secret.\xE2\x80\x9D

Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany
him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended
them.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the
guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, \xE2\x80\x9Cwho married the daughter of
Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint
Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!\xE2\x80\x9D

The word \xE2\x80\x9Cwife\xE2\x80\x9D seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say
with sudden impatience, \xE2\x80\x9CIn the name of that sharp female newly-born,
and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the
truth?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA bad truth for you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and
looking straight before him.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so
sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a
little help?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNone.\xE2\x80\x9D Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you answer me a single question?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free
communication with the world outside?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will see.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of
presenting my case?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried
in worse prisons, before now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut never by me, Citizen Defarge.\xE2\x80\x9D

Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady
and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope
there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.
He, therefore, made haste to say:

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better
than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to
Mr. Lorry of Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,
the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the
prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will do,\xE2\x80\x9D Defarge doggedly rejoined, \xE2\x80\x9Cnothing for you. My duty is to
my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you.
I will do nothing for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride
was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see
how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned
their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;
otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no
more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they
passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited
audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal
family. The few words that he caught from this man\xE2\x80\x99s lips, first made
it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the
foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at
Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal
watchfulness had completely isolated him.

That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That
perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster
yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he
might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events
of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by
the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future
was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant
hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few
rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed
garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had
been a hundred thousand years away. The \xE2\x80\x9Csharp female newly-born, and
called La Guillotine,\xE2\x80\x9D was hardly known to him, or to the generality
of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were
probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could
they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?

Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation
from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the
certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on
his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he
arrived at the prison of La Force.

A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge
presented \xE2\x80\x9CThe Emigrant Evremonde.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat the Devil! How many more of them!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed the man with the
bloated face.

Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew,
with his two fellow-patriots.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat the Devil, I say again!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.
\xE2\x80\x9CHow many more!\xE2\x80\x9D

The gaoler\xE2\x80\x99s wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely
replied, \xE2\x80\x9COne must have patience, my dear!\xE2\x80\x9D Three turnkeys who entered
responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, \xE2\x80\x9CFor
the love of Liberty;\xE2\x80\x9D which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
conclusion.

The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome
flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that
are ill cared for!

\xE2\x80\x9CIn secret, too,\xE2\x80\x9D grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. \xE2\x80\x9CAs
if I was not already full to bursting!\xE2\x80\x9D

He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in
either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
subordinates.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome!\xE2\x80\x9D said the chief, at length taking up his keys, \xE2\x80\x9Ccome with me,
emigrant.\xE2\x80\x9D

Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by
corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,
until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with
prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading
and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the
most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the
room.

In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning
unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to
receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with
all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.

So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and
gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and
misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand
in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost
of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of
frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes
that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.

It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other
gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance
in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly
coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were
there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the
mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and
likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its
utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress
of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!

\xE2\x80\x9CIn the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,\xE2\x80\x9D said a
gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, \xE2\x80\x9CI have the
honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you
on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate
happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,
to ask your name and condition?\xE2\x80\x9D

Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in
words as suitable as he could find.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I hope,\xE2\x80\x9D said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his
eyes, who moved across the room, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you are not in secret?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say
so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several
members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted
but a short time.\xE2\x80\x9D Then he added, raising his voice, \xE2\x80\x9CI grieve to inform
the society--in secret.\xE2\x80\x9D

There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room
to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among
which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave
him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to
render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler\xE2\x80\x99s hand; and
the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.

The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had
ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted
them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a
solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.

\xE2\x80\x9CYours,\xE2\x80\x9D said the gaoler.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy am I confined alone?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow do I know!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can buy pen, ink, and paper?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSuch are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At
present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.\xE2\x80\x9D

There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As
the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four
walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of
the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler
was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like
a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was
gone, he thought in the same wandering way, \xE2\x80\x9CNow am I left, as if I were
dead.\xE2\x80\x9D Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it
with a sick feeling, and thought, \xE2\x80\x9CAnd here in these crawling creatures
is the first condition of the body after death.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFive paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five
paces by four and a half.\xE2\x80\x9D The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,
counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled
drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. \xE2\x80\x9CHe made shoes, he made
shoes, he made shoes.\xE2\x80\x9D The prisoner counted the measurement again, and
paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.
\xE2\x80\x9CThe ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among
them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the
embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden
hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God\xE2\x80\x99s sake,
through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He
made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and
a half.\xE2\x80\x9D With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of
his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting
and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it
still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he
knew, in the swell that rose above them.




II. The Grindstone


Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was
in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from
the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to
a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the
troubles, in his own cook\xE2\x80\x99s dress, and got across the borders. A
mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his
metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation
of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men
besides the cook in question.

Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the
sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and
willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and
indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur\xE2\x80\x99s
house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all
things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce
precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month
of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of
Monseigneur\xE2\x80\x99s house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were
drinking brandy in its state apartments.

A place of business in London like Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s place of business in Paris,
would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.
For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have
said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid
over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s had whitewashed the
Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest
linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to
night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in
Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of
the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and
also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest
provocation. Yet, a French Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s could get on with these things
exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had
taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.

What money would be drawn out of Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s henceforth, and what would
lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons,
and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into
the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis
Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by
a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was
prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a
deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the
room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.

He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which
he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they
derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about
that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did
his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,
was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages
of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two
great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the
open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared
to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,
or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless
objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had
opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and
he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.

From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came
the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring
in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
nature were going up to Heaven.

\xE2\x80\x9CThank God,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat no one near and
dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all
who are in danger!\xE2\x80\x9D

Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,
\xE2\x80\x9CThey have come back!\xE2\x80\x9D and sat listening. But, there was no loud
irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate
clash again, and all was quiet.

The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally
awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to
go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly
opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in
amazement.

Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with
that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it
seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
force and power to it in this one passage of her life.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is this?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is the
matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?
What is it?\xE2\x80\x9D

With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted
out in his arms, imploringly, \xE2\x80\x9CO my dear friend! My husband!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour husband, Lucie?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCharles.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat of Charles?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHere.

\xE2\x80\x9CHere, in Paris?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHas been here some days--three or four--I don\xE2\x80\x99t know how many--I can\xE2\x80\x99t
collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to
us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the
bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices
came pouring into the courtyard.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is that noise?\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, turning towards the window.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t look!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t look out! Manette, for your life,
don\xE2\x80\x99t touch the blind!\xE2\x80\x9D

The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and
said, with a cool, bold smile:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been
a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In
France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would
touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I
knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I
told Lucie so.--What is that noise?\xE2\x80\x9D His hand was again upon the window.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t look!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. \xE2\x80\x9CNo, Lucie, my
dear, nor you!\xE2\x80\x9D He got his arm round her, and held her. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t be so
terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm
having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in
this fatal place. What prison is he in?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLa Force!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLa Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in
your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to
do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or
I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;
you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you
to do for Charles\xE2\x80\x99s sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must
instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a
room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for
two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not
delay.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do
nothing else than this. I know you are true.\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the
key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and
partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s arm, and
looked out with him into the courtyard.

Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near
enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The
people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they
had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up
there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.

But, such awful workers, and such awful work!

The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two
men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of
the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than
the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.
False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their
hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with
howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung
forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women
held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping
blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks
struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from
the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the
sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all
over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain
upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women\xE2\x80\x99s lace
and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through
and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be
sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to
the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments
of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And
as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in
their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have
given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.

All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of
any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it
were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for
explanation in his friend\xE2\x80\x99s ashy face.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at
the locked room, \xE2\x80\x9Cmurdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you
say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you
have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It
may be too late, I don\xE2\x80\x99t know, but let it not be a minute later!\xE2\x80\x9D

Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,
and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.

His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous
confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,
carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.
For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and
the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,
surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all
linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with
cries of--\xE2\x80\x9CLive the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s
kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save
the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!\xE2\x80\x9D and a thousand answering shouts.

He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window
and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was
assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found
her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat
watching them in such quiet as the night knew.

Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,
clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own
bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O
the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!

Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the
irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Lucie, affrighted. \xE2\x80\x9CHush! The soldiers\xE2\x80\x99 swords are
sharpened there,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CThe place is national property now,
and used as a kind of armoury, my love.\xE2\x80\x9D

Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself
from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so
besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back
to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by
the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.
Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,
climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its
dainty cushions.

The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,
and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood
alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had
never given, and would never take away.




III. The Shadow


One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.
Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to
imperil Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded
for Lucie and her child, without a moment\xE2\x80\x99s demur; but the great trust
he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict
man of business.

At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out
the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the
same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the
most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in
its dangerous workings.

Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute\xE2\x80\x99s delay
tending to compromise Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said
that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that
Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to
this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and
he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry
went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up
in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.

To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:
giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.
He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.
A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly
and heavily the day lagged on with him.

It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He
was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to
do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a
man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,
addressed him by his name.

\xE2\x80\x9CYour servant,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CDo you know me?\xE2\x80\x9D

He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five
to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of
emphasis, the words:

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have seen you somewhere.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps at my wine-shop?\xE2\x80\x9D

Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: \xE2\x80\x9CYou come from Doctor
Manette?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. I come from Doctor Manette.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what says he? What does he send me?\xE2\x80\x9D

Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the
words in the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s writing:

    \xE2\x80\x9CCharles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.
     I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
     from Charles to his wife.  Let the bearer see his wife.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was dated from La Force, within an hour.

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you accompany me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading
this note aloud, \xE2\x80\x9Cto where his wife resides?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Defarge.

Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the
courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.

\xE2\x80\x9CMadame Defarge, surely!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly
the same attitude some seventeen years ago.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is she,\xE2\x80\x9D observed her husband.

\xE2\x80\x9CDoes Madame go with us?\xE2\x80\x9D inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as
they moved.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.
It is for their safety.\xE2\x80\x9D

Beginning to be struck by Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously
at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being
The Vengeance.

They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,
ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,
and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the
tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that
delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in
the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.

     \xE2\x80\x9CDEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has
      influence around me.  You cannot answer this.
      Kiss our child for me.\xE2\x80\x9D

That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received
it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the
hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took
to its knitting again.

There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in
the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her
neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted
eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; \xE2\x80\x9Cthere are frequent
risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever
trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power
to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she
may identify them. I believe,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his
reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
upon him more and more, \xE2\x80\x9CI state the case, Citizen Defarge?\xE2\x80\x9D

Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a
gruff sound of acquiescence.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou had better, Lucie,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to
propitiate, by tone and manner, \xE2\x80\x9Chave the dear child here, and our
good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no
French.\xE2\x80\x9D

The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a
match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,
appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,
whom her eyes first encountered, \xE2\x80\x9CWell, I am sure, Boldface! I hope
_you_ are pretty well!\xE2\x80\x9D She also bestowed a British cough on Madame
Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that his child?\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the
first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it
were the finger of Fate.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, madame,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Mr. Lorry; \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is our poor prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s darling
daughter, and only child.\xE2\x80\x9D

The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so
threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively
kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The
shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,
threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is enough, my husband,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CI have seen them. We
may go.\xE2\x80\x9D

But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and
presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as
she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s dress:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will
help me to see him if you can?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour husband is not my business here,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Madame Defarge, looking
down at her with perfect composure. \xE2\x80\x9CIt is the daughter of your father
who is my business here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child\xE2\x80\x99s sake! She
will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more
afraid of you than of these others.\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.
Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,
collected his face into a sterner expression.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it that your husband says in that little letter?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Madame
Defarge, with a lowering smile. \xE2\x80\x9CInfluence; he says something touching
influence?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat my father,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her
breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, \xE2\x80\x9Chas
much influence around him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSurely it will release him!\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CLet it do so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs a wife and mother,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Lucie, most earnestly, \xE2\x80\x9CI implore you to
have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against
my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think
of me. As a wife and mother!\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
turning to her friend The Vengeance:

\xE2\x80\x9CThe wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little
as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have
known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,
often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in
themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,
sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have seen nothing else,\xE2\x80\x9D returned The Vengeance.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have borne this a long time,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes
again upon Lucie. \xE2\x80\x9CJudge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife
and mother would be much to us now?\xE2\x80\x9D

She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge
went last, and closed the door.

\xE2\x80\x9CCourage, my dear Lucie,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. \xE2\x80\x9CCourage,
courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of
late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a
shadow on me and on all my hopes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTut, tut!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry; \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is this despondency in the brave
little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.\xE2\x80\x9D

But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,
for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.




IV. Calm in Storm


Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that
not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been
tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.

To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a
scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had
found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were
brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back
to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he
had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the
body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this
man was Defarge.

That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,
that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard
to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some
dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life
and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded
to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and
examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible
to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,
the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held
inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner
was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the
Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,
delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and
had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.

The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had
been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had
thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress
the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him
in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies
of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man
with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him
carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged
anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes
with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.

As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of
his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that
such dread experiences would revive the old danger.

But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never
at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor
felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which
could break the prison door of his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s husband, and deliver him.
\xE2\x80\x9CIt all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.
As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be
helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid
of Heaven I will do it!\xE2\x80\x9D Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw
the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a
clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.

Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would
have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself
in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees
of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his
personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician
of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the
general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet
messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself
sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s hand), but she was
not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of
plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.

This new life of the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the
sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.
Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;
but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that
time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter
and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.
Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through
that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles\xE2\x80\x99s
ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,
that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to
trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself
and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in
rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. \xE2\x80\x9CAll
curious to see,\xE2\x80\x9D thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut all
natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it
couldn\xE2\x80\x99t be in better hands.\xE2\x80\x9D

But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get
Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,
the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new
era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death
against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the
great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise
against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils
of France, as if the dragon\xE2\x80\x99s teeth had been sown broadcast, and
had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and
alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of
the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds
and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the
fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.
What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year
One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,
and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!

There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no
measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when
time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other
count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever
of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the
unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the
head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the
head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.

And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in
all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A
revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand
revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,
which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over
any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged
with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;
these things became the established order and nature of appointed
things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.
Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before
the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the
sharp female called La Guillotine.

It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,
it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a
peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which
shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window
and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the
human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts
from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and
believed in where the Cross was denied.

It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,
were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young
Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed
the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and
good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one
dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.
The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief
functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his
namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God\xE2\x80\x99s own Temple every
day.

Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked
with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his
end, never doubting that he would save Lucie\xE2\x80\x99s husband at last. Yet the
current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time
away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three
months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more
wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,
that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the
violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares
under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the
terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at
that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable
in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and
victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the
appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all
other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if
he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were
a Spirit moving among mortals.




V. The Wood-Sawyer


One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never
sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her
husband\xE2\x80\x99s head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the
tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright
women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and
old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all
daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons,
and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst.
Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to
bestow, O Guillotine!

If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time,
had stunned the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s daughter into awaiting the result in idle
despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from
the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in
the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was
truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good
will always be.

As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father
had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little
household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had
its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught,
as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The
slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief
that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy
return, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and the
solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many
unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only
outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.

She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to
mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well
attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour,
and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional,
thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at
night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had
repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven,
was on him. He always resolutely answered: \xE2\x80\x9CNothing can happen to him
without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie.\xE2\x80\x9D

They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her
father said to her, on coming home one evening:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can
sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to
it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you
in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can
show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even
if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.\xE2\x80\x9D

From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the
clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.
When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they
went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a
single day.

It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel
of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that
end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed
her.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood day, citizeness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood day, citizen.\xE2\x80\x9D

This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been
established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;
but, was now law for everybody.

\xE2\x80\x9CWalking here again, citizeness?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou see me, citizen!\xE2\x80\x9D

The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he
had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed
at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent
bars, peeped through them jocosely.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it\xE2\x80\x99s not my business,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. And went on sawing his wood.

Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she
appeared.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat? Walking here again, citizeness?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, citizen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo I say yes, mamma?\xE2\x80\x9D whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, dearest.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, citizen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! But it\xE2\x80\x99s not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I
call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head
comes!\xE2\x80\x9D

The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.

\xE2\x80\x9CI call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again!
Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off _her_ head comes! Now, a child.
Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off _its_ head comes. All the
family!\xE2\x80\x9D

Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was
impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in
his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him
first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.

He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten
him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart
up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her,
with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. \xE2\x80\x9CBut it\xE2\x80\x99s
not my business!\xE2\x80\x9D he would generally say at those times, and would
briskly fall to his sawing again.

In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of
spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again
in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at
this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.
Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in
five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not
for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did
see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have
waited out the day, seven days a week.

These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her
father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing
afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild
rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along,
decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them;
also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription
(tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible.
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!

The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole
surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got
somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in
with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike
and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his
saw inscribed as his \xE2\x80\x9CLittle Sainte Guillotine\xE2\x80\x9D--for the great sharp
female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he
was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.

But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment
afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with
The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and
they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music
than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song,
keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.
Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced
together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a
mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they
filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly
apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They
advanced, retreated, struck at one another\xE2\x80\x99s hands, clutched at one
another\xE2\x80\x99s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round
in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest
linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then
reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped
again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width
of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high
up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once
innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the
heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly
bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child\xE2\x80\x99s head thus distracted, the
delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of
the disjointed time.

This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and
bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer\xE2\x80\x99s house, the feathery snow
fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.

\xE2\x80\x9CO my father!\xE2\x80\x9D for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she
had momentarily darkened with her hand; \xE2\x80\x9Csuch a cruel, bad sight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don\xE2\x80\x99t be
frightened! Not one of them would harm you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my
husband, and the mercies of these people--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing to
the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You may
kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou cannot see him, my poor dear?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, father,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand,
\xE2\x80\x9Cno.\xE2\x80\x9D

A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CI salute you, citizeness,\xE2\x80\x9D
 from the Doctor. \xE2\x80\x9CI salute you, citizen.\xE2\x80\x9D This in passing. Nothing more.
Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.

\xE2\x80\x9CGive me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness
and courage, for his sake. That was well done;\xE2\x80\x9D they had left the spot;
\xE2\x80\x9Cit shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor to-morrow!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions
to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned
before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I know
that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the
Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?\xE2\x80\x9D

She could scarcely answer, \xE2\x80\x9CI trust in you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall
be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every
protection. I must see Lorry.\xE2\x80\x9D

He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They
both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring
away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.

\xE2\x80\x9CI must see Lorry,\xE2\x80\x9D the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.

The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He
and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
and made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No
better man living to hold fast by what Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s had in keeping, and to
hold his peace.

A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted
the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at the
Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and
deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters:
National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity, or Death!

Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the
chair--who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did he come out,
agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? To whom did
he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and
turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued,
he said: \xE2\x80\x9CRemoved to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?\xE2\x80\x9D




VI. Triumph


The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined
Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were
read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The
standard gaoler-joke was, \xE2\x80\x9CCome out and listen to the Evening Paper, you
inside there!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCharles Evremonde, called Darnay!\xE2\x80\x9D

So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.

When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles
Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen
hundreds pass away so.

His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them
to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the
list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three
names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so
summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been
guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber
where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his
arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human
creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the
scaffold.

There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was
soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force
were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears
there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be
refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the
common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from
insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the
time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour
or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to
brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere
boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In
seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the
disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have
like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke
them.

The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its
vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were
put to the bar before Charles Darnay\xE2\x80\x99s name was called. All the fifteen
were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.

\xE2\x80\x9CCharles Evremonde, called Darnay,\xE2\x80\x9D was at length arraigned.

His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap
and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking
at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the
usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the
honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never
without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing
spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,
anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,
the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore
knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many
knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under
her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly
remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed
in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to
himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to
be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at
the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,
in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.
Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who
wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
Carmagnole.

Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor
as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree
which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the
decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was
the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.

\xE2\x80\x9CTake off his head!\xE2\x80\x9D cried the audience. \xE2\x80\x9CAn enemy to the Republic!\xE2\x80\x9D

The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the
prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in
England?

Undoubtedly it was.

Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?

Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.

Why not? the President desired to know.

Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left
his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in
England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.

What proof had he of this?

He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and
Alexandre Manette.

But he had married in England? the President reminded him.

True, but not an English woman.

A citizeness of France?

Yes. By birth.

Her name and family?

\xE2\x80\x9CLucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who
sits there.\xE2\x80\x9D

This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation
of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were
the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as
if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.

On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot
according to Doctor Manette\xE2\x80\x99s reiterated instructions. The same cautious
counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every
inch of his road.

The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not
sooner?

He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means
of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England,
he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.
He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of
a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his
absence. He had come back, to save a citizen\xE2\x80\x99s life, and to bear his
testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal
in the eyes of the Republic?

The populace cried enthusiastically, \xE2\x80\x9CNo!\xE2\x80\x9D and the President rang his
bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry \xE2\x80\x9CNo!\xE2\x80\x9D
 until they left off, of their own will.

The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained
that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence
to the citizen\xE2\x80\x99s letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier,
but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
the President.

The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that
it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen
Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the
pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out
of the Tribunal\xE2\x80\x99s patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he
had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury\xE2\x80\x99s
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde,
called Darnay.

Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,
and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he
proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his
release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in
England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat
government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as
the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these
circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the
straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the
populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur
Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,
had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his
account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that
they were ready with their votes if the President were content to
receive them.

At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace
set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s
favour, and the President declared him free.

Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace
sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against
their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of
these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,
to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner
was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after
his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same
people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with
the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the
streets.

His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,
rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried
together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not
assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate
itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to
him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four
hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign
of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, \xE2\x80\x9CLong live the
Republic!\xE2\x80\x9D

The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,
for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great
crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the
concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by
turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the
shore.

They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had
taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.
Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they
had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not
even the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home
on men\xE2\x80\x99s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him,
and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that
he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he
was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.

In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing
him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as
they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried
him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father
had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his
feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.

As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his
face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come
together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the
rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.
Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the
crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river\xE2\x80\x99s bank,
and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
them away.

After grasping the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s hand, as he stood victorious and proud
before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in
breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;
after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round
his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who
lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their
rooms.

\xE2\x80\x9CLucie! My own! I am safe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have
prayed to Him.\xE2\x80\x9D

They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in
his arms, he said to her:

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France
could have done what he has done for me.\xE2\x80\x9D

She laid her head upon her father\xE2\x80\x99s breast, as she had laid his poor
head on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return he
had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his
strength. \xE2\x80\x9CYou must not be weak, my darling,\xE2\x80\x9D he remonstrated; \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t
tremble so. I have saved him.\xE2\x80\x9D




VII. A Knock at the Door


\xE2\x80\x9CI have saved him.\xE2\x80\x9D It was not another of the dreams in which he had
often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a
vague but heavy fear was upon her.

All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately
revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on
vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her
heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.
The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued
them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to
his real presence and trembled more.

Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this
woman\xE2\x80\x99s weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking,
no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task
he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let
them all lean upon him.

Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was
the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but
because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,
had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards
the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and
partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and
citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them
occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by
Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every
night.

It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every
house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.
Jerry Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down
below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name
himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had
employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called
Darnay.

In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s little household, as
in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.

For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the
basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home
such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long
association with a French family, might have known as much of their
language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that
direction; consequently she knew no more of that \xE2\x80\x9Cnonsense\xE2\x80\x9D (as she was
pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing
was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be
the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold
of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always
made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,
one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Mr. Cruncher,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;
\xE2\x80\x9Cif you are ready, I am.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s service. He had worn
all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s all manner of things wanted,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cand we shall
have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts
these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,\xE2\x80\x9D
 retorted Jerry, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether they drink your health or the Old Un\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho\xE2\x80\x99s he?\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross.

Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning \xE2\x80\x9COld
Nick\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHa!\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cit doesn\xE2\x80\x99t need an interpreter to explain the
meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it\xE2\x80\x99s Midnight Murder,
and Mischief.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Lucie.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, yes, yes, I\xE2\x80\x99ll be cautious,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I may say
among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the
streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!
Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don\xE2\x80\x99t move your
pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think you may take that liberty,\xE2\x80\x9D the Doctor answered, smiling.

\xE2\x80\x9CFor gracious sake, don\xE2\x80\x99t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of
that,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross.

\xE2\x80\x9CHush, dear! Again?\xE2\x80\x9D Lucie remonstrated.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, my sweet,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe
short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious
Majesty King George the Third;\xE2\x80\x9D Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; \xE2\x80\x9Cand
as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish
tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words
after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you
had never taken that cold in your voice,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, approvingly.
\xE2\x80\x9CBut the question, Doctor Manette. Is there\xE2\x80\x9D--it was the good creature\xE2\x80\x99s
way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety
with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--\xE2\x80\x9Cis there any
prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHeigh-ho-hum!\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she
glanced at her darling\xE2\x80\x99s golden hair in the light of the fire, \xE2\x80\x9Cthen we
must have patience and wait: that\xE2\x80\x99s all. We must hold up our heads and
fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don\xE2\x80\x99t
you move, Ladybird!\xE2\x80\x9D

They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the
child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the
Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in
a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie
sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,
in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of
a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out
a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and
quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is that?\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, all at once.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear!\xE2\x80\x9D said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand
on hers, \xE2\x80\x9Ccommand yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The
least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father\xE2\x80\x99s daughter!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought, my father,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face
and in a faltering voice, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I heard strange feet upon the stairs.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy love, the staircase is as still as Death.\xE2\x80\x9D

As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.

\xE2\x80\x9COh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy child,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her
shoulder, \xE2\x80\x9CI _have_ saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go
to the door.\xE2\x80\x9D

He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,
and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough
men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay,\xE2\x80\x9D said the first.

\xE2\x80\x9CWho seeks him?\xE2\x80\x9D answered Darnay.

\xE2\x80\x9CI seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the
Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic.\xE2\x80\x9D

The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging
to him.

\xE2\x80\x9CTell me how and why am I again a prisoner?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will
know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow.\xE2\x80\x9D

Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he
stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it,
moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting
the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red
woollen shirt, said:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know him, you have said. Do you know me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe all know you, Citizen Doctor,\xE2\x80\x9D said the other three.

He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice,
after a pause:

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCitizen Doctor,\xE2\x80\x9D said the first, reluctantly, \xE2\x80\x9Che has been denounced to
the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,\xE2\x80\x9D pointing out the second who
had entered, \xE2\x80\x9Cis from Saint Antoine.\xE2\x80\x9D

The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is accused by Saint Antoine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf what?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the Doctor.

\xE2\x80\x9CCitizen Doctor,\xE2\x80\x9D said the first, with his former reluctance, \xE2\x80\x9Cask no
more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as
a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all.
The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COne word,\xE2\x80\x9D the Doctor entreated. \xE2\x80\x9CWill you tell me who denounced him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is against rule,\xE2\x80\x9D answered the first; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut you can ask Him of Saint
Antoine here.\xE2\x80\x9D

The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his
feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced--and gravely--by
the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat other?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen,\xE2\x80\x9D said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou will be
answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!\xE2\x80\x9D




VIII. A Hand at Cards


Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her
way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases
she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They
both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and
turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It
was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing
lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were
stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the
Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got
undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never
grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.

Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil
for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,
once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather
took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same
description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was
not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her
opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,
attended by her cavalier.

Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,
bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of
the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be
resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the
popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,
like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached
the counter, and showed what they wanted.

As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a
corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No
sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped
her hands.

In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was
assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only
saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all
the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,
evidently English.

What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very
voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss
Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no
ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that
not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,
Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual
account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;
speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in
English.

\xE2\x80\x9COh, Solomon, dear Solomon!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again.
\xE2\x80\x9CAfter not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,
do I find you here!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the
man, in a furtive, frightened way.

\xE2\x80\x9CBrother, brother!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. \xE2\x80\x9CHave I ever
been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen hold your meddlesome tongue,\xE2\x80\x9D said Solomon, \xE2\x80\x9Cand come out, if you
want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who\xE2\x80\x99s this man?\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother, said through her tears, \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Cruncher.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet him come out too,\xE2\x80\x9D said Solomon. \xE2\x80\x9CDoes he think me a ghost?\xE2\x80\x9D

Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a
word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did
so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus
of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French
language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
pursuits.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat do you
want?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away
from!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cto give me such a greeting, and show me no
affection.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere. Confound it! There,\xE2\x80\x9D said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s
lips with his own. \xE2\x80\x9CNow are you content?\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you expect me to be surprised,\xE2\x80\x9D said her brother Solomon, \xE2\x80\x9CI am not
surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If
you really don\xE2\x80\x99t want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you
do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I
am an official.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy English brother Solomon,\xE2\x80\x9D mourned Miss Pross, casting up her
tear-fraught eyes, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat had the makings in him of one of the best and
greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and
such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
his--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI said so!\xE2\x80\x9D cried her brother, interrupting. \xE2\x80\x9CI knew it. You want to be
the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just
as I am getting on!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Pross. \xE2\x80\x9CFar
rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever
loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,
and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will
detain you no longer.\xE2\x80\x9D

Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any
culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years
ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent
her money and left her!

He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging
condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative
merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,
all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,
hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular
question:

\xE2\x80\x9CI say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,
or Solomon John?\xE2\x80\x9D

The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not
previously uttered a word.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher. \xE2\x80\x9CSpeak out, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D (Which, by the way,
was more than he could do himself.) \xE2\x80\x9CJohn Solomon, or Solomon John? She
calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know
you\xE2\x80\x99re John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that
name of Pross, likewise. That warn\xE2\x80\x99t your name over the water.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, I don\xE2\x80\x99t know all I mean, for I can\xE2\x80\x99t call to mind what your name
was, over the water.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo. But I\xE2\x80\x99ll swear it was a name of two syllables.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. T\xE2\x80\x99other one\xE2\x80\x99s was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness
at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to
yourself, was you called at that time?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBarsad,\xE2\x80\x9D said another voice, striking in.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s the name for a thousand pound!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Jerry.

The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind
him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s
elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s, to his
surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself
elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present
myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a
better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad
was not a Sheep of the Prisons.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy,
who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney. \xE2\x80\x9CI lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out
of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,
an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember
faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having
a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with
the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your
direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and
sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the
nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed
to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat purpose?\xE2\x80\x9D the spy asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the
street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your
company--at the office of Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s Bank, for instance?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUnder a threat?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Did I say that?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, why should I go there?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CReally, Mr. Barsad, I can\xE2\x80\x99t say, if you can\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you mean that you won\xE2\x80\x99t say, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D the spy irresolutely asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x9D

Carton\xE2\x80\x99s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his
quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,
and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and
made the most of it.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, I told you so,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his
sister; \xE2\x80\x9Cif any trouble comes of this, it\xE2\x80\x99s your doing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, come, Mr. Barsad!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Sydney. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t be ungrateful.
But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so
pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual
satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I\xE2\x80\x99ll go with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her
own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,
at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort
knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s with us. Are we
ready? Come then!\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life
remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney\xE2\x80\x99s arm and looked up
in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced
purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only
contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was
too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved
her affection, and with Sydney\xE2\x80\x99s friendly reassurances, adequately to
heed what she observed.

They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.
Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s, which was within a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99 walk. John Barsad, or Solomon
Pross, walked at his side.

Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery
little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the
picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, who had looked
into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years
ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with
which he saw a stranger.

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s brother, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney. \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Barsad.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBarsad?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the old gentleman, \xE2\x80\x9CBarsad? I have an association
with the name--and with the face.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Carton,
coolly. \xE2\x80\x9CPray sit down.\xE2\x80\x9D

As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,
by saying to him with a frown, \xE2\x80\x9CWitness at that trial.\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry
immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised
look of abhorrence.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate
brother you have heard of,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney, \xE2\x80\x9Cand has acknowledged the
relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.\xE2\x80\x9D

Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you
tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about
to return to him!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CArrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJust now, if at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I
have it from Mr. Barsad\xE2\x80\x99s communication to a friend and brother Sheep
over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the
messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no
earthly doubt that he is retaken.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s business eye read in the speaker\xE2\x80\x99s face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was
silently attentive.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, I trust,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney to him, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat the name and influence of
Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he
would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; I believe so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own
to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette\xE2\x80\x99s not having had the
power to prevent this arrest.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe may not have known of it beforehand,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how
identified he is with his son-in-law.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s true,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his
chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.

\xE2\x80\x9CIn short,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is a desperate time, when desperate games
are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I
will play the losing one. No man\xE2\x80\x99s life here is worth purchase. Any one
carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the
stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend
in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.
Barsad.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou need have good cards, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll run them over. I\xE2\x80\x99ll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a
brute I am; I wish you\xE2\x80\x99d give me a little brandy.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another
glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Barsad,\xE2\x80\x9D he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking
over a hand at cards: \xE2\x80\x9CSheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican
committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,
so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman
is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a
Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.
That\xE2\x80\x99s a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican
French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That\xE2\x80\x99s an excellent
card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.
Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the
spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,
the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
difficult to find. That\xE2\x80\x99s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my
hand, Mr. Barsad?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot to understand your play,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.

\xE2\x80\x9CI play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section
Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don\xE2\x80\x99t
hurry.\xE2\x80\x9D

He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and
drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself
into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he
poured out and drank another glassful.

\xE2\x80\x9CLook over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards
in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable
employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for
vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in
France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He
knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint
Antoine and Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police
such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette\xE2\x80\x99s imprisonment,
release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to
familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame
Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered
with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he
talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.
He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over
again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the
guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as
he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that
he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of
his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such
grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw
that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many
proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash
his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon
terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify
the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou scarcely seem to like your hand,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney, with the greatest
composure. \xE2\x80\x9CDo you play?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr.
Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9CI may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to
put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can
under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace
of which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is
considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by
somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean
himself as to make himself one?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, taking the answer on himself,
and looking at his watch, \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout any scruple, in a very few minutes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should have hoped, gentlemen both,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy, always striving to
hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat your respect for my sister--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her of her brother,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney Carton.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou think not, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have thoroughly made up my mind about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his
ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,
received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a
mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and
failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air
of contemplating cards:

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I
have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and
fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;
who was he?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFrench. You don\xE2\x80\x99t know him,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy, quickly.

\xE2\x80\x9CFrench, eh?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him
at all, though he echoed his word. \xE2\x80\x9CWell; he may be.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs, I assure you,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy; \xE2\x80\x9Cthough it\xE2\x80\x99s not important.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThough it\xE2\x80\x99s not important,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Carton, in the same mechanical
way--\xE2\x80\x9Cthough it\xE2\x80\x99s not important--No, it\xE2\x80\x99s not important. No. Yet I know
the face.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think not. I am sure not. It can\xE2\x80\x99t be,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt-can\xE2\x80\x99t-be,\xE2\x80\x9D muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his
glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. \xE2\x80\x9CCan\xE2\x80\x99t-be. Spoke good
French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CProvincial,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo. Foreign!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a
light broke clearly on his mind. \xE2\x80\x9CCly! Disguised, but the same man. We
had that man before us at the Old Bailey.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, there you are hasty, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Barsad, with a smile that gave his
aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; \xE2\x80\x9Cthere you really give
me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this
distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I
attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church
of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard
multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped
to lay him in his coffin.\xE2\x80\x9D

Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable
goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it
to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s head.

\xE2\x80\x9CLet us be reasonable,\xE2\x80\x9D said the spy, \xE2\x80\x9Cand let us be fair. To show you
how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will
lay before you a certificate of Cly\xE2\x80\x99s burial, which I happened to have
carried in my pocket-book,\xE2\x80\x9D with a hurried hand he produced and opened
it, \xE2\x80\x9Cever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take
it in your hand; it\xE2\x80\x99s no forgery.\xE2\x80\x9D

Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and
Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more
violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the
crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.

Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on
the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat there Roger Cly, master,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and
iron-bound visage. \xE2\x80\x9CSo _you_ put him in his coffin?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho took him out of it?\xE2\x80\x9D

Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI mean,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he warn\xE2\x80\x99t never in it. No! Not he!
I\xE2\x80\x99ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.\xE2\x80\x9D

The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in
unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.

\xE2\x80\x9CI tell you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jerry, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you buried paving-stones and earth in
that there coffin. Don\xE2\x80\x99t go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a
take in. Me and two more knows it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow do you know it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s that to you? Ecod!\xE2\x80\x9D growled Mr. Cruncher, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s you I have got a
old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!
I\xE2\x80\x99d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and
explain himself.

\xE2\x80\x9CAt another time, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, evasively, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe present time is
ill-conwenient for explainin\xE2\x80\x99. What I stand to, is, that he knows well
wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,
in so much as a word of one syllable, and I\xE2\x80\x99ll either catch hold of his
throat and choke him for half a guinea;\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as
quite a liberal offer; \xE2\x80\x9Cor I\xE2\x80\x99ll out and announce him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHumph! I see one thing,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton. \xE2\x80\x9CI hold another card, Mr. Barsad.
Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for
you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another
aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has
the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!
A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong
card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo!\xE2\x80\x9D returned the spy. \xE2\x80\x9CI throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular
with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk
of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that
he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this
man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever you trouble your head about this man,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted the contentious
Mr. Cruncher; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou\xE2\x80\x99ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
that gentleman. And look here! Once more!\xE2\x80\x9D--Mr. Cruncher could not
be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his
liberality--\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea.\xE2\x80\x9D

The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,
with more decision, \xE2\x80\x9CIt has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and
can\xE2\x80\x99t overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?
Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my
office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my
life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,
I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate
here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my
way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with
me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said the spy, firmly.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at the
Conciergerie?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sometimes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou can be when you choose?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can pass in and out when I choose.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he
said, rising:

\xE2\x80\x9CSo far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that
the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come
into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.\xE2\x80\x9D




IX. The Game Made


While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining
dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked
at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman\xE2\x80\x99s
manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the
leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,
and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very
questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s eye caught
his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the
hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an
infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.

\xE2\x80\x9CJerry,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CCome here.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance
of him.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat have you been, besides a messenger?\xE2\x80\x9D

After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,
Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, \xE2\x80\x9CAgicultooral
character.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy mind misgives me much,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger
at him, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s
as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous
description. If you have, don\xE2\x80\x99t expect me to befriend you when you
get back to England. If you have, don\xE2\x80\x99t expect me to keep your secret.
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s shall not be imposed upon.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat a gentleman like
yourself wot I\xE2\x80\x99ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I\xE2\x80\x99m grey at it,
would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don\xE2\x80\x99t say it
is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if
it wos, it wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t, even then, be all o\xE2\x80\x99 one side. There\xE2\x80\x99d be two sides
to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking
up their guineas where a honest tradesman don\xE2\x80\x99t pick up his
fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor
yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s, and a cocking
their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going
out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.
Well, that \xE2\x80\x98ud be imposing, too, on Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s. For you cannot sarse the
goose and not the gander. And here\xE2\x80\x99s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos
in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,
a floppin\xE2\x80\x99 again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark
ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors\xE2\x80\x99 wives don\xE2\x80\x99t flop--catch \xE2\x80\x98em at
it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,
and how can you rightly have one without t\xE2\x80\x99other? Then, wot with
undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot
with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t get
much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never
prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. He\xE2\x80\x99d never have no good of it; he\xE2\x80\x99d want
all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being
once in--even if it wos so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUgh!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, \xE2\x80\x9CI am shocked at
the sight of you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Mr. Cruncher,
\xE2\x80\x9Ceven if it wos so, which I don\xE2\x80\x99t say it is--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t prevaricate,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I will _not_, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were
further from his thoughts or practice--\xE2\x80\x9Cwhich I don\xE2\x80\x99t say it is--wot I
would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at
that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to
be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till
your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it
wos so, which I still don\xE2\x80\x99t say it is (for I will not prewaricate to
you, sir), let that there boy keep his father\xE2\x80\x99s place, and take care of
his mother; don\xE2\x80\x99t blow upon that boy\xE2\x80\x99s father--do not do it, sir--and
let that father go into the line of the reg\xE2\x80\x99lar diggin\xE2\x80\x99, and make amends
for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin\xE2\x80\x99 of \xE2\x80\x98em in with
a will, and with conwictions respectin\xE2\x80\x99 the futur\xE2\x80\x99 keepin\xE2\x80\x99 of \xE2\x80\x98em safe.
That, Mr. Lorry,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his
arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his
discourse, \xE2\x80\x9Cis wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don\xE2\x80\x99t
see all this here a goin\xE2\x80\x99 on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects
without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
to porterage and hardly that, without havin\xE2\x80\x99 his serious thoughts of
things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin\xE2\x80\x99 of you
fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good
cause when I might have kep\xE2\x80\x99 it back.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat at least is true,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CSay no more now. It may be
that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
action--not in words. I want no more words.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy
returned from the dark room. \xE2\x80\x9CAdieu, Mr. Barsad,\xE2\x80\x9D said the former; \xE2\x80\x9Cour
arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.\xE2\x80\x9D

He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they
were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?

\xE2\x80\x9CNot much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access
to him, once.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s countenance fell.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is all I could do,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton. \xE2\x80\x9CTo propose too much, would be
to put this man\xE2\x80\x99s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing
worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the
weakness of the position. There is no help for it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut access to him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, \xE2\x80\x9Cif it should go ill before the
Tribunal, will not save him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never said it would.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his
darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually
weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,
and his tears fell.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a good man and a true friend,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, in an altered
voice. \xE2\x80\x9CForgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my
father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your
sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,
however.\xE2\x80\x9D

Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there
was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,
that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly
unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo return to poor Darnay,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t tell Her of this
interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see
him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey
to him the means of anticipating the sentence.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to
see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and
evidently understood it.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe might think a thousand things,\xE2\x80\x9D Carton said, \xE2\x80\x9Cand any of them would
only add to her trouble. Don\xE2\x80\x99t speak of me to her. As I said to you when
I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any
little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.
You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going now, directly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance
on you. How does she look?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D

It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It
attracted Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s eyes to Carton\xE2\x80\x99s face, which was turned to the
fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a
wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat
and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,
all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was
sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;
his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had
broken under the weight of his foot.

\xE2\x80\x9CI forgot it,\xE2\x80\x9D he said.

Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the
wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having
the expression of prisoners\xE2\x80\x99 faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly
reminded of that expression.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, turning
to him.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so
unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to
have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have
my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.\xE2\x80\x9D

They were both silent.

\xE2\x80\x9CYours is a long life to look back upon, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, wistfully.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am in my seventy-eighth year.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;
trusted, respected, and looked up to?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I
may say that I was a man of business when a boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSee what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss
you when you leave it empty!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA solitary old bachelor,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. \xE2\x80\x9CThere
is nobody to weep for me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow can you say that? Wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t She weep for you? Wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t her child?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, yes, thank God. I didn\xE2\x80\x99t quite mean what I said.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSurely, surely.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,
\xE2\x80\x98I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or
respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no
regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!\xE2\x80\x99
your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they
not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a
few moments, said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the
days when you sat at your mother\xE2\x80\x99s knee, seem days of very long ago?\xE2\x80\x9D

Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:

\xE2\x80\x9CTwenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw
closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and
nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and
preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances
that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),
and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not
so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI understand the feeling!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd
you are the better for it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope so.\xE2\x80\x9D

Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with
his outer coat; \xE2\x80\x9CBut you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou
are young.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton. \xE2\x80\x9CI am not old, but my young way was never the way to
age. Enough of me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd of me, I am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CAre you going out?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless
habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don\xE2\x80\x99t be
uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, unhappily.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a
place for me. Take my arm, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A
few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s destination. Carton left him
there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate
again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to
the prison every day. \xE2\x80\x9CShe came out here,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, looking about him,
\xE2\x80\x9Cturned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in
her steps.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was ten o\xE2\x80\x99clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,
where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having
closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood night, citizen,\xE2\x80\x9D said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the
man eyed him inquisitively.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood night, citizen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow goes the Republic?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount
to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being
exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you often go to see him--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGo and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,
citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less
than two pipes. Word of honour!\xE2\x80\x9D

As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain
how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire
to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you are not English,\xE2\x80\x9D said the wood-sawyer, \xE2\x80\x9Cthough you wear
English dress?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou speak like a Frenchman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am an old student here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood night, citizen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut go and see that droll dog,\xE2\x80\x9D the little man persisted, calling after
him. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd take a pipe with you!\xE2\x80\x9D

Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of
the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered
the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,
for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
terror--he stopped at a chemist\xE2\x80\x99s shop, which the owner was closing with
his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill
thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.

Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his
counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. \xE2\x80\x9CWhew!\xE2\x80\x9D the chemist
whistled softly, as he read it. \xE2\x80\x9CHi! hi! hi!\xE2\x80\x9D

Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:

\xE2\x80\x9CFor you, citizen?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the
consequences of mixing them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerfectly.\xE2\x80\x9D

Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by
one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,
and deliberately left the shop. \xE2\x80\x9CThere is nothing more to do,\xE2\x80\x9D said he,
glancing upward at the moon, \xE2\x80\x9Cuntil to-morrow. I can\xE2\x80\x99t sleep.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words
aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who
had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into
his road and saw its end.

Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a
youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His
mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been
read at his father\xE2\x80\x99s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark
streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing
on high above him. \xE2\x80\x9CI am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:
he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.\xE2\x80\x9D

In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow
rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,
and for to-morrow\xE2\x80\x99s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,
and still of to-morrow\xE2\x80\x99s and to-morrow\xE2\x80\x99s, the chain of association that
brought the words home, like a rusty old ship\xE2\x80\x99s anchor from the deep,
might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and
went on.

With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers
were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and
profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon
the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets
along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among
the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn
interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for
the lighter streets.

Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy
shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the
people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At
one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking
for a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over,
and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me, shall never die.\xE2\x80\x9D

Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words
were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm
and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he
heard them always.

The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the
water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the
picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the
sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died,
and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to
Death\xE2\x80\x99s dominion.

But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden
of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.
And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light
appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river
sparkled under it.

The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial
friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the
houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little
longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the
stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--\xE2\x80\x9CLike me.\xE2\x80\x9D

A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then
glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track
in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,
ended in the words, \xE2\x80\x9CI am the resurrection and the life.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise
where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a
little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh
himself, went out to the place of trial.

The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell
away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.
Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there,
sitting beside her father.

When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so
sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying
tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy
blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If
there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney
Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.

Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,
ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have
been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not
first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the
Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.

Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good
republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day
after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and
his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance
gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,
cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.
Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.

Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.
No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,
murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye
in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one
another, before bending forward with a strained attention.

Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and
retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected and
Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants,
one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished
privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evremonde,
called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.

To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.

The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?

\xE2\x80\x9COpenly, President.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBy whom?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThree voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTherese Defarge, his wife.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAlexandre Manette, physician.\xE2\x80\x9D

A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor
Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.

\xE2\x80\x9CPresident, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and
a fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My
daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who
and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband
of my child!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCitizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of
the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is dearer
to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
Republic.\xE2\x80\x9D

Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell, and
with warmth resumed.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is
to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!\xE2\x80\x9D

Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with
his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew
closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,
and restored the usual hand to his mouth.

Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his
being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of
his having been a mere boy in the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s service, and of the release,
and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him.
This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe so.\xE2\x80\x9D

Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: \xE2\x80\x9CYou were one of the
best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day
there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when
it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!\xE2\x80\x9D

It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience,
thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The
Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, \xE2\x80\x9CI defy that bell!\xE2\x80\x9D
 wherein she was likewise much commended.

\xE2\x80\x9CInform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,
citizen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI knew,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the
bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;
\xE2\x80\x9CI knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell
known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He
knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower,
when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day, I resolve,
when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount to
the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a
gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a
stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is
that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens
of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette.
I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of
the President.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet it be read.\xE2\x80\x9D

In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking
lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with
solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the
reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge
never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there
intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as
follows.




X. The Substance of the Shadow


\xE2\x80\x9CI, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and
afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write
it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it
in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a
place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I
and my sorrows are dust.

\xE2\x80\x9CThese words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with
difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed
with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope
has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have
noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I
solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right
mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the
truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they
be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.

\xE2\x80\x9COne cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the
twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired
part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air,
at an hour\xE2\x80\x99s distance from my place of residence in the Street of the
School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very
fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it
might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a
voice called to the driver to stop.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,
and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
door and alight before I came up with it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to
conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,
I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather
younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice,
and (as far as I could see) face too.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98You are Doctor Manette?\xE2\x80\x99 said one.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,\xE2\x80\x99 said the other; \xE2\x80\x98the young
physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two
has made a rising reputation in Paris?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xE2\x80\x99 I returned, \xE2\x80\x98I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so
graciously.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98We have been to your residence,\xE2\x80\x99 said the first, \xE2\x80\x98and not being
so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of
overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CThe manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words
were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.
They were armed. I was not.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xE2\x80\x99 said I, \xE2\x80\x98pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me
the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to
which I am summoned.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CThe reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. \xE2\x80\x98Doctor,
your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to
enter the carriage?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CI could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both
entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The
carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that
it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it took
place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make
the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my
paper in its hiding-place.

        *****

\xE2\x80\x9CThe carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and
emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the
Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards
when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently
stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by
a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in
answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,
for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the
other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner
with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found
locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had
relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was
conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,
lying on a bed.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much
past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to
her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were
all portions of a gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s dress. On one of them, which was a fringed
scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble,
and the letter E.

\xE2\x80\x9CI saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient;
for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was
in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve
her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the
corner caught my sight.

\xE2\x80\x9CI turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her
and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and
wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the
words, \xE2\x80\x98My husband, my father, and my brother!\xE2\x80\x99 and then counted up to
twelve, and said, \xE2\x80\x98Hush!\xE2\x80\x99 For an instant, and no more, she would pause
to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she
would repeat the cry, \xE2\x80\x98My husband, my father, and my brother!\xE2\x80\x99 and
would count up to twelve, and say, \xE2\x80\x98Hush!\xE2\x80\x99 There was no variation in the
order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment\xE2\x80\x99s
pause, in the utterance of these sounds.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98How long,\xE2\x80\x99 I asked, \xE2\x80\x98has this lasted?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CTo distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the
younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. It
was the elder who replied, \xE2\x80\x98Since about this hour last night.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98She has a husband, a father, and a brother?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98A brother.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98I do not address her brother?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CHe answered with great contempt, \xE2\x80\x98No.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98She has some recent association with the number twelve?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CThe younger brother impatiently rejoined, \xE2\x80\x98With twelve o\xE2\x80\x99clock?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98See, gentlemen,\xE2\x80\x99 said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, \xE2\x80\x98how
useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming
to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There
are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CThe elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, \xE2\x80\x98There is
a case of medicines here;\xE2\x80\x99 and brought it from a closet, and put it on
the table.

        *****

\xE2\x80\x9CI opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my
lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Do you doubt them?\xE2\x80\x99 asked the younger brother.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,\xE2\x80\x99 I replied, and said no
more.

\xE2\x80\x9CI made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many
efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it
after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then
sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman
in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into
a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently
furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick
old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the
sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular
succession, with the cry, \xE2\x80\x98My husband, my father, and my brother!\xE2\x80\x99 the
counting up to twelve, and \xE2\x80\x98Hush!\xE2\x80\x99 The frenzy was so violent, that I had
not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to
them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement
in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer\xE2\x80\x99s breast had this much
soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the
figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more
regular.

\xE2\x80\x9CFor the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,
before the elder said:

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98There is another patient.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CI was startled, and asked, \xE2\x80\x98Is it a pressing case?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98You had better see,\xE2\x80\x99 he carelessly answered; and took up a light.

        *****

\xE2\x80\x9CThe other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which
was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling
to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and
there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of
the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to
pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial
and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in
this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my
captivity, as I saw them all that night.

\xE2\x80\x9COn some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a
handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most.
He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his
breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see
where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see
that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98I am a doctor, my poor fellow,\xE2\x80\x99 said I. \xE2\x80\x98Let me examine it.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98I do not want it examined,\xE2\x80\x99 he answered; \xE2\x80\x98let it be.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away.
The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours
before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to
without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder
brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all
as if he were a fellow-creature.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98How has this been done, monsieur?\xE2\x80\x99 said I.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him,
and has fallen by my brother\xE2\x80\x99s sword--like a gentleman.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CThere was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this
answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would
have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his
vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
the boy, or about his fate.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe boy\xE2\x80\x99s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now
slowly moved to me.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are
proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but
we have a little pride left, sometimes. She--have you seen her, Doctor?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CThe shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the
distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.

\xE2\x80\x9CI said, \xE2\x80\x98I have seen her.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these
Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we
have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say
so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a
tenant of his. We were all tenants of his--that man\xE2\x80\x99s who stands there.
The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs
are by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to
work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged
to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden
for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and
plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we
ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his
people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed,
and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a
dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should
most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable
race die out!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CI had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth
like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the
dying boy.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that time,
poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort
him in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it. She had not
been married many weeks, when that man\xE2\x80\x99s brother saw her and admired
her, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among
us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and
hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine. What did the two
then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her
willing?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CThe boy\xE2\x80\x99s eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the
looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The two
opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this
Bastille; the gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s, all negligent indifference; the peasant\xE2\x80\x99s, all
trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him and
drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their
grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was
not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he
could find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the
bell, and died on her bosom.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to
tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as
he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his
wound.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Then, with that man\xE2\x80\x99s permission and even with his aid, his
brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his
brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if
it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion,
for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the
tidings home, our father\xE2\x80\x99s heart burst; he never spoke one of the words
that filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place
beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be
_his_ vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed
in--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window? It was
somewhere here?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CThe room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around
him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he was
dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck
at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to
make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword
that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust
at me with all his skill for his life.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CMy glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of
a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s. In
another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier\xE2\x80\x99s.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98He is not here,\xE2\x80\x99 I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he
referred to the brother.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the
man who was here? Turn my face to him.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CI did so, raising the boy\xE2\x80\x99s head against my knee. But, invested for the
moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging
me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Marquis,\xE2\x80\x99 said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and
his right hand raised, \xE2\x80\x98in the days when all these things are to be
answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to
answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that
I do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for,
I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them
separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do
it.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CTwice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him
down dead.

        *****

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving
in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might last
for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the
grave.

\xE2\x80\x9CI repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing
quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
of her words. They were always \xE2\x80\x98My husband, my father, and my brother!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve. Hush!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CThis lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had
come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to
falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and
by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and
fearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to
compose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew
her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had
had of her.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Is she dead?\xE2\x80\x99 asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the
elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Not dead,\xE2\x80\x99 said I; \xE2\x80\x98but like to die.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98What strength there is in these common bodies!\xE2\x80\x99 he said, looking down
at her with some curiosity.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98There is prodigious strength,\xE2\x80\x99 I answered him, \xE2\x80\x98in sorrow and
despair.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CHe first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved a
chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a
subdued voice,

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I
recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high,
and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful
of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen,
and not spoken of.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CI listened to the patient\xE2\x80\x99s breathing, and avoided answering.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Monsieur,\xE2\x80\x99 said I, \xE2\x80\x98in my profession, the communications of patients
are always received in confidence.\xE2\x80\x99 I was guarded in my answer, for I
was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.

\xE2\x80\x9CHer breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the
pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I
resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.

        *****

\xE2\x80\x9CI write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so
fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total
darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or
failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that
was ever spoken between me and those brothers.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some few
syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She
asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It
was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her
head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.

\xE2\x80\x9CI had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the
brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until
then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the
woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind
the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to
that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as
if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.

\xE2\x80\x9CI always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brother\xE2\x80\x99s (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that
peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger
brother\xE2\x80\x99s eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply,
for knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more polite to
me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance
in the mind of the elder, too.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch,
answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was alone
with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and
all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride
away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with
their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98At last she is dead?\xE2\x80\x99 said the elder, when I went in.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98She is dead,\xE2\x80\x99 said I.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98I congratulate you, my brother,\xE2\x80\x99 were his words as he turned round.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He now
gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it on
the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept
nothing.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Pray excuse me,\xE2\x80\x99 said I. \xE2\x80\x98Under the circumstances, no.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CThey exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to
them, and we parted without another word on either side.

        *****

\xE2\x80\x9CI am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery. I cannot read what I
have written with this gaunt hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CEarly in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously
considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately
to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been
summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the
circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities
of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be
heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a
profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state
in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but
I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were
compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that
night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it.
It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just
completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.

        *****

\xE2\x80\x9CI am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is
so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so
dreadful.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long
life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the
wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the
boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered
on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I
had seen that nobleman very lately.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our
conversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I
know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected, and
in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband\xE2\x80\x99s
share in it, and my being resorted to. She did not know that the girl
was dead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her,
in secret, a woman\xE2\x80\x99s sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of
Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and
her greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing
but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her
inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope
that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this
wretched hour I am ignorant of both.

        *****

\xE2\x80\x9CThese scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning,
yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How
could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence
was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her
husband too. When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a
pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98For his sake, Doctor,\xE2\x80\x99 she said, pointing to him in tears, \xE2\x80\x98I would do
all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper in his
inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent
atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him. What
I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few
jewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the
compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if
the sister can be discovered.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CShe kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, \xE2\x80\x98It is for thine own dear
sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?\xE2\x80\x99 The child answered her
bravely, \xE2\x80\x98Yes!\xE2\x80\x99 I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and
went away caressing him. I never saw her more.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs she had mentioned her husband\xE2\x80\x99s name in the faith that I knew it,
I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not
trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat night, the last night of the year, towards nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock, a man in
a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed
my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant came
into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart!
My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at
the gate, standing silent behind him.

\xE2\x80\x9CAn urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain me,
he had a coach in waiting.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the
house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and
my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark
corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from
his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light
of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot.
Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living
grave.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the
brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of
my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But,
now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that
they have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the
last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last
night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times
when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven
and to earth.\xE2\x80\x9D

A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A
sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,
and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.

Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show
how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured
Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their
time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long been
anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.
The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have
sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.

And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a
well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife. One
of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of
the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and
self-immolations on the people\xE2\x80\x99s altar. Therefore when the President
said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good
physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by
rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel
a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an
orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of
human sympathy.

\xE2\x80\x9CMuch influence around him, has that Doctor?\xE2\x80\x9D murmured Madame Defarge,
smiling to The Vengeance. \xE2\x80\x9CSave him now, my Doctor, save him!\xE2\x80\x9D

At every juryman\xE2\x80\x99s vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar and
roar.

Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy
of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the
Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!




XI. Dusk


The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under
the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no
sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was
she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment
it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.

The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors,
the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the court\xE2\x80\x99s
emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood
stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face
but love and consolation.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens, if
you would have so much compassion for us!\xE2\x80\x9D

There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had
taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the
show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, \xE2\x80\x9CLet her embrace
him then; it is but a moment.\xE2\x80\x9D It was silently acquiesced in, and they
passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by
leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.

\xE2\x80\x9CFarewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We
shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!\xE2\x80\x9D

They were her husband\xE2\x80\x99s words, as he held her to his bosom.

\xE2\x80\x9CI can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don\xE2\x80\x99t suffer
for me. A parting blessing for our child.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by
you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy husband. No! A moment!\xE2\x80\x9D He was tearing himself apart from her.
\xE2\x80\x9CWe shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart
by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God
will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both
of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel
to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know, now what
you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We
know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for
her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and
duty. Heaven be with you!\xE2\x80\x9D

Her father\xE2\x80\x99s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair,
and wring them with a shriek of anguish.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt could not be otherwise,\xE2\x80\x9D said the prisoner. \xE2\x80\x9CAll things have worked
together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to
discharge my poor mother\xE2\x80\x99s trust that first brought my fatal presence
near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in
nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven
bless you!\xE2\x80\x9D

As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him
with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and
with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting
smile. As he went out at the prisoners\xE2\x80\x99 door, she turned, laid her head
lovingly on her father\xE2\x80\x99s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his
feet.

Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved,
Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were
with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.
Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a
flush of pride in it.

\xE2\x80\x9CShall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.\xE2\x80\x9D

He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a
coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat
beside the driver.

When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of
the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up
the staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch, where
her child and Miss Pross wept over her.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t recall her to herself,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, softly, to the latter, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe is
better so. Don\xE2\x80\x99t revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!\xE2\x80\x9D cried little Lucie, springing up and
throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. \xE2\x80\x9CNow that
you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to
save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who
love her, bear to see her so?\xE2\x80\x9D

He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He
put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.

\xE2\x80\x9CBefore I go,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, and paused--\xE2\x80\x9CI may kiss her?\xE2\x80\x9D

It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face
with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to
him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a
handsome old lady, that she heard him say, \xE2\x80\x9CA life you love.\xE2\x80\x9D

When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry
and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least
be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to
you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the
strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.\xE2\x80\x9D He returned the
answer in great trouble, and very slowly.

\xE2\x80\x9CTry them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few
and short, but try.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI intend to try. I will not rest a moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before
now--though never,\xE2\x80\x9D he added, with a smile and a sigh together, \xE2\x80\x9Csuch
great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse
it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it
were not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will go,\xE2\x80\x9D said Doctor Manette, \xE2\x80\x9Cto the Prosecutor and the President
straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will
write too, and--But stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and no
one will be accessible until dark.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the
forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you
speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen
these dread powers, Doctor Manette?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CImmediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from
this.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I
go to Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from
our friend or from yourself?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay you prosper!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the
shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have no hope,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.

\xE2\x80\x9CNor have I.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare
him--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man\xE2\x80\x99s
to them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the
court.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t despond,\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, very gently; \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t grieve. I encouraged
Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be
consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think \xE2\x80\x98his life was wantonly
thrown away or wasted,\xE2\x80\x99 and that might trouble her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, yes, yes,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are right.
But he will perish; there is no real hope.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. He will perish: there is no real hope,\xE2\x80\x9D echoed Carton.

And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.




XII. Darkness


Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. \xE2\x80\x9CAt
Tellson\xE2\x80\x99s banking-house at nine,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, with a musing face. \xE2\x80\x9CShall I
do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that
these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound
precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care!
Let me think it out!\xE2\x80\x9D

Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a
turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought
in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was
confirmed. \xE2\x80\x9CIt is best,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, finally resolved, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat these people
should know there is such a man as I here.\xE2\x80\x9D And he turned his face
towards Saint Antoine.

Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in
the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city
well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained
its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined
at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the
first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he
had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had
dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s hearth like a man who had
done with it.

It was as late as seven o\xE2\x80\x99clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out
into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he
stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and
his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s, and went in.

There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the
restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon
the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the
Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like
a regular member of the establishment.

As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent
French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless
glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced
to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.

He repeated what he had already said.

\xE2\x80\x9CEnglish?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows.

After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were
slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign
accent. \xE2\x80\x9CYes, madame, yes. I am English!\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he
took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning, he heard her say, \xE2\x80\x9CI swear to you, like Evremonde!\xE2\x80\x9D

Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood evening.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Good evening, citizen,\xE2\x80\x9D filling his glass. \xE2\x80\x9CAh! and good wine. I
drink to the Republic.\xE2\x80\x9D

Defarge went back to the counter, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CCertainly, a little like.\xE2\x80\x9D
 Madame sternly retorted, \xE2\x80\x9CI tell you a good deal like.\xE2\x80\x9D Jacques Three
pacifically remarked, \xE2\x80\x9CHe is so much in your mind, see you, madame.\xE2\x80\x9D
 The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, \xE2\x80\x9CYes, my faith! And you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
to-morrow!\xE2\x80\x9D

Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow
forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence
of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without
disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed
their conversation.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is true what madame says,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Jacques Three. \xE2\x80\x9CWhy stop? There
is great force in that. Why stop?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, well,\xE2\x80\x9D reasoned Defarge, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut one must stop somewhere. After all,
the question is still where?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt extermination,\xE2\x80\x9D said madame.

\xE2\x80\x9CMagnificent!\xE2\x80\x9D croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly
approved.

\xE2\x80\x9CExtermination is good doctrine, my wife,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, rather
troubled; \xE2\x80\x9Cin general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has
suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when
the paper was read.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have observed his face!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.
\xE2\x80\x9CYes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the
face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you have observed, my wife,\xE2\x80\x9D said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthe anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have observed his daughter,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated madame; \xE2\x80\x9Cyes, I have observed
his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I
have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and
I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my
finger--!\xE2\x80\x9D She seemed to raise it (the listener\xE2\x80\x99s eyes were always on
his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as
if the axe had dropped.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe citizeness is superb!\xE2\x80\x9D croaked the Juryman.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is an Angel!\xE2\x80\x9D said The Vengeance, and embraced her.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs to thee,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, \xE2\x80\x9Cif it
depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this
man even now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo!\xE2\x80\x9D protested Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CNot if to lift this glass would do it! But I
would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSee you then, Jacques,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; \xE2\x80\x9Cand see you,
too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as
tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register,
doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is so,\xE2\x80\x9D assented Defarge, without being asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CIn the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds
this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the
night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot,
by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is so,\xE2\x80\x9D assented Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is
burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between
those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is
that so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is so,\xE2\x80\x9D assented Defarge again.

\xE2\x80\x9CI communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two
hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, \xE2\x80\x98Defarge, I was brought up
among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured
by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my
family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground
was my sister, that husband was my sister\xE2\x80\x99s husband, that unborn child
was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,
those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things
descends to me!\xE2\x80\x99 Ask him, is that so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is so,\xE2\x80\x9D assented Defarge once more.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen tell Wind and Fire where to stop,\xE2\x80\x9D returned madame; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut don\xE2\x80\x99t
tell me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing
her--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed
a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but
only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. \xE2\x80\x9CTell
the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!\xE2\x80\x9D

Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer
paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as
a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge
took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.
The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might
be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and
deep.

But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present
himself in Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s room again, where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie
until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and
keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the
banking-house towards four o\xE2\x80\x99clock. She had some faint hopes that his
mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been
more than five hours gone: where could he be?

Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and
he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he
should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.
In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.

He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette
did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and
brought none. Where could he be?

They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some
weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on
the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was
lost.

Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that
time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at
them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot find it,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I must have it. Where is it?\xE2\x80\x9D

His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look
straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I
can\xE2\x80\x99t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must
finish those shoes.\xE2\x80\x9D

They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, come!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, in a whimpering miserable way; \xE2\x80\x9Clet me get to
work. Give me my work.\xE2\x80\x9D

Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the
ground, like a distracted child.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t torture a poor forlorn wretch,\xE2\x80\x9D he implored them, with a dreadful
cry; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are
not done to-night?\xE2\x80\x9D

Lost, utterly lost!

It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,
that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and
soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should
have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the
embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret
time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into
the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.

Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle
of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely
daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both
too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with
one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:

\xE2\x80\x9CThe last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken
to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to
me? Don\xE2\x80\x99t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and
exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not doubt it,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Mr. Lorry. \xE2\x80\x9CSay on.\xE2\x80\x9D

The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the
night.

Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his
feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his day\xE2\x80\x99s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton
took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. \xE2\x80\x9CWe should look
at this!\xE2\x80\x9D he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and
exclaimed, \xE2\x80\x9CThank _God!_\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.

\xE2\x80\x9CA moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,\xE2\x80\x9D he put his hand in
his coat, and took another paper from it, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat is the certificate which
enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton,
an Englishman?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.

\xE2\x80\x9CKeep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you
remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor
Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him
and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the
frontier! You see?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,
yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don\xE2\x80\x99t stay to look; put it
up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until
within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is
good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to
think, will be.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are not in danger?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame
Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that
woman\xE2\x80\x99s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong
colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He
confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall,
is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by
Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her\xE2\x80\x9D--he never mentioned Lucie\xE2\x80\x99s
name--\xE2\x80\x9Cmaking signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that
the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will
involve her life--and perhaps her child\xE2\x80\x99s--and perhaps her father\xE2\x80\x99s--for
both have been seen with her at that place. Don\xE2\x80\x99t look so horrified. You
will save them all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHeaven grant I may, Carton! But how?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend
on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place
until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards;
more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to
mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her
father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the
inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that
strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for
the moment I lose sight,\xE2\x80\x9D touching the back of the Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s chair, \xE2\x80\x9Ceven
of this distress.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast
as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have been
completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have your
horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the
afternoon.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt shall be done!\xE2\x80\x9D

His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the
flame, and was as quick as youth.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man?
Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child
and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head
beside her husband\xE2\x80\x99s cheerfully.\xE2\x80\x9D He faltered for an instant; then went
on as before. \xE2\x80\x9CFor the sake of her child and her father, press upon her
the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. Tell
her that it was her husband\xE2\x80\x99s last arrangement. Tell her that more
depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her
father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in
the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage.
The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will
reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and
then for England!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady
hand, \xE2\x80\x9Cit does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young
and ardent man at my side.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBy the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing will
influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one
another.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing, Carton.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRemember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for
any reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must
inevitably be sacrificed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!\xE2\x80\x9D

Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even
put the old man\xE2\x80\x99s hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. He
helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers,
as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find
where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought
to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the
courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in
the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to
it--outwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained
there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of
her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a
Farewell.




XIII. Fifty-two


In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited
their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were
to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless
everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants
were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday,
the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set
apart.

Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy,
whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose
poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered
in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees;
and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,
intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally
without distinction.

Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line
of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,
that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could
avail him nothing.

Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life
was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts
and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and
when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,
this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts,
a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against
resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and
child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a
selfish thing.

But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there
was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate
him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So,
by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his
thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.

Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had
travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means
of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the
prison lamps should be extinguished.

He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing
of her father\xE2\x80\x99s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself,
and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father\xE2\x80\x99s and uncle\xE2\x80\x99s
responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had
already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that
her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her,
for her father\xE2\x80\x99s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had
become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled
to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on
that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had
preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that
he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no
mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had
discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He
besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console
her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think
of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly
reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their
dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her
father.

To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And
he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any
despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be
tending.

To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.
That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so
full of the others, that he never once thought of him.

He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When
he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.

But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining
forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had
nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of
heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and
he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even
suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there
was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the
sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it
flashed upon his mind, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is the day of my death!\xE2\x80\x9D

Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads
were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could
meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking
thoughts, which was very difficult to master.

He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How
high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be
stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed
red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first,
or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise
directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless
times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no
fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.

The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the
numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for
ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly
repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over.
He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for
himself and for them.

Twelve gone for ever.

He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would
be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two
before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.

Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very
different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force,
he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour had
measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his
recovered self-possession, he thought, \xE2\x80\x9CThere is but another now,\xE2\x80\x9D and
turned to walk again.

Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.

The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or
as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: \xE2\x80\x9CHe has never seen
me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose
no time!\xE2\x80\x9D

The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him
face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his
features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.

There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the
first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own
imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s
hand, and it was his real grasp.

\xE2\x80\x9COf all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?\xE2\x80\x9D he said.

\xE2\x80\x9CI could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You
are not\xE2\x80\x9D--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--\xE2\x80\x9Ca prisoner?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her--your
wife, dear Darnay.\xE2\x80\x9D

The prisoner wrung his hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CI bring you a request from her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well
remember.\xE2\x80\x9D

The prisoner turned his face partly aside.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have
no time to tell you. You must comply with it--take off those boots you
wear, and draw on these of mine.\xE2\x80\x9D

There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.
Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got
him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.

\xE2\x80\x9CDraw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your will to
them. Quick!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCarton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. You
will only die with me. It is madness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I ask you
to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. Change
that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While you do
it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like
this of mine!\xE2\x80\x9D

With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action,
that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him.
The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.

\xE2\x80\x9CCarton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never
can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you
not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that,
refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand
steady enough to write?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was when you came in.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\xE2\x80\x9D

Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table.
Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.

\xE2\x80\x9CWrite exactly as I speak.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo whom do I address it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo no one.\xE2\x80\x9D Carton still had his hand in his breast.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo I date it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with
his hand in his breast, looked down.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98If you remember,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, dictating, \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98the words that passed
between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look
up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon
something.

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you written \xE2\x80\x98forget them\xE2\x80\x99?\xE2\x80\x9D Carton asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; I am not armed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it in your hand?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.\xE2\x80\x9D He
dictated again. \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove
them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D As he said these
words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly
moved down close to the writer\xE2\x80\x99s face.

The pen dropped from Darnay\xE2\x80\x99s fingers on the table, and he looked about
him vacantly.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat vapour is that?\xE2\x80\x9D he asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CVapour?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSomething that crossed me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen
and finish. Hurry, hurry!\xE2\x80\x9D

As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the
prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton
with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his
hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him.

\xE2\x80\x9CHurry, hurry!\xE2\x80\x9D

The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98If it had been otherwise;\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D Carton\xE2\x80\x99s hand was again watchfully and
softly stealing down; \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98I never should have used the longer opportunity.
If it had been otherwise;\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D the hand was at the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s face; \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98I
should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been
otherwise--\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
unintelligible signs.

Carton\xE2\x80\x99s hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up
with a reproachful look, but Carton\xE2\x80\x99s hand was close and firm at his
nostrils, and Carton\xE2\x80\x99s left arm caught him round the waist. For a few
seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his
life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on
the ground.

Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton
dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back
his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he
softly called, \xE2\x80\x9CEnter there! Come in!\xE2\x80\x9D and the Spy presented himself.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou see?\xE2\x80\x9D said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the
insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: \xE2\x80\x9Cis your hazard very
great?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Carton,\xE2\x80\x9D the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, \xE2\x80\x9Cmy
hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to
the whole of your bargain.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t fear me. I will be true to the death.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being
made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHave no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the
rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and
take me to the coach.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou?\xE2\x80\x9D said the Spy nervously.

\xE2\x80\x9CHim, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which
you brought me in?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf course.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you
take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has
happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands.
Quick! Call assistance!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou swear not to betray me?\xE2\x80\x9D said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a
last moment.

\xE2\x80\x9CMan, man!\xE2\x80\x9D returned Carton, stamping his foot; \xE2\x80\x9Chave I sworn by no
solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious
moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place
him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him
yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of
last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!\xE2\x80\x9D

The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his
forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow, then?\xE2\x80\x9D said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. \xE2\x80\x9CSo
afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
Sainte Guillotine?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA good patriot,\xE2\x80\x9D said the other, \xE2\x80\x9Ccould hardly have been more afflicted
if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.\xE2\x80\x9D

They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe time is short, Evremonde,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Spy, in a warning voice.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know it well,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Carton. \xE2\x80\x9CBe careful of my friend, I entreat
you, and leave me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, then, my children,\xE2\x80\x9D said Barsad. \xE2\x80\x9CLift him, and come away!\xE2\x80\x9D

The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of
listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote
suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,
footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry
made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he
sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.

Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then
began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and
finally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely
saying, \xE2\x80\x9CFollow me, Evremonde!\xE2\x80\x9D and he followed into a large dark room,
at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows
within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern
the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were
standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;
but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking
fixedly at the ground.

As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two
were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him,
as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of
discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young
woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was
no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from
the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.

\xE2\x80\x9CCitizen Evremonde,\xE2\x80\x9D she said, touching him with her cold hand. \xE2\x80\x9CI am a
poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.\xE2\x80\x9D

He murmured for answer: \xE2\x80\x9CTrue. I forget what you were accused of?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPlots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it
likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
like me?\xE2\x80\x9D

The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears
started from his eyes.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. I
am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good
to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,
Citizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!\xE2\x80\x9D

As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it
warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.

\xE2\x80\x9CI heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was. But, I was again taken and condemned.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your
hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me
more courage.\xE2\x80\x9D

As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in
them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young
fingers, and touched his lips.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you dying for him?\xE2\x80\x9D she whispered.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd his wife and child. Hush! Yes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.\xE2\x80\x9D

        *****

The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that
same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about
it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.

\xE2\x80\x9CWho goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!\xE2\x80\x9D

The papers are handed out, and read.

\xE2\x80\x9CAlexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?\xE2\x80\x9D

This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man
pointed out.

\xE2\x80\x9CApparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The
Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?\xE2\x80\x9D

Greatly too much for him.

\xE2\x80\x9CHah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is she?\xE2\x80\x9D

This is she.

\xE2\x80\x9CApparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?\xE2\x80\x9D

It is.

\xE2\x80\x9CHah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child. English.
This is she?\xE2\x80\x9D

She and no other.

\xE2\x80\x9CKiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican;
something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton. Advocate.
English. Which is he?\xE2\x80\x9D

He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.

\xE2\x80\x9CApparently the English advocate is in a swoon?\xE2\x80\x9D

It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that
he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is
under the displeasure of the Republic.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the
displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window.
Jarvis Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am he. Necessarily, being the last.\xE2\x80\x9D

It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It
is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach
door, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the
carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it
carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to
the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its
mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of
an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.

\xE2\x80\x9CBehold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COne can depart, citizen?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COne can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!\xE2\x80\x9D

These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and
looks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there
is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster?\xE2\x80\x9D
 asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too much;
it would rouse suspicion.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLook back, look back, and see if we are pursued!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.\xE2\x80\x9D

Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings,
dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless
trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on
either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the
stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and
sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our
wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing
anything but stopping.

Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary
farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,
avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back
by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven,
no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush!
the posting-house.

Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in
the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it
of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible
existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and
plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count
their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.
All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would
far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.

At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left
behind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and
on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with
animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their
haunches. We are pursued?

\xE2\x80\x9CHo! Within the carriage there. Speak then!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it?\xE2\x80\x9D asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow many did they say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not understand you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C--At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFifty-two.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it
forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes
handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!\xE2\x80\x9D

The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and
to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him,
by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help
us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.

The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and
the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.




XIV. The Knitting Done


In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate
Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and
Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame
Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,
erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the
conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who
was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut our Defarge,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jacques Three, \xE2\x80\x9Cis undoubtedly a good
Republican? Eh?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is no better,\xE2\x80\x9D the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill
notes, \xE2\x80\x9Cin France.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPeace, little Vengeance,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with
a slight frown on her lieutenant\xE2\x80\x99s lips, \xE2\x80\x9Chear me speak. My husband,
fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved
well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has
his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a great pity,\xE2\x80\x9D croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head,
with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; \xE2\x80\x9Cit is not quite like a good
citizen; it is a thing to regret.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSee you,\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, \xE2\x80\x9CI care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear
his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to
me. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and
child must follow the husband and father.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe has a fine head for it,\xE2\x80\x9D croaked Jacques Three. \xE2\x80\x9CI have seen blue
eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held
them up.\xE2\x80\x9D Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.

Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe child also,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment
of his words, \xE2\x80\x9Chas golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child
there. It is a pretty sight!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn a word,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,
\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since
last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects;
but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning,
and then they might escape.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat must never be,\xE2\x80\x9D croaked Jacques Three; \xE2\x80\x9Cno one must escape. We
have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn a word,\xE2\x80\x9D Madame Defarge went on, \xE2\x80\x9Cmy husband has not my reason for
pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for
regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,
therefore. Come hither, little citizen.\xE2\x80\x9D

The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the
submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.

\xE2\x80\x9CTouching those signals, little citizen,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, sternly,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthat she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them
this very day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAy, ay, why not!\xE2\x80\x9D cried the sawyer. \xE2\x80\x9CEvery day, in all weathers, from
two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes
without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.\xE2\x80\x9D

He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
never seen.

\xE2\x80\x9CClearly plots,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jacques Three. \xE2\x80\x9CTransparently!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is no doubt of the Jury?\xE2\x80\x9D inquired Madame Defarge, letting her
eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.

\xE2\x80\x9CRely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my
fellow-Jurymen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, let me see,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, pondering again. \xE2\x80\x9CYet once more!
Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can
I spare him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe would count as one head,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Jacques Three, in a low voice.
\xE2\x80\x9CWe really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe was signalling with her when I saw her,\xE2\x80\x9D argued Madame Defarge; \xE2\x80\x9CI
cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and
trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a
bad witness.\xE2\x80\x9D

The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a
celestial witness.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe must take his chance,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CNo, I cannot spare
him! You are engaged at three o\xE2\x80\x99clock; you are going to see the batch of
to-day executed.--You?\xE2\x80\x9D

The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in
the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been
suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
him out of Madame Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s head) of having his small individual fears
for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.

\xE2\x80\x9CI,\xE2\x80\x9D said madame, \xE2\x80\x9Cam equally engaged at the same place. After it is
over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we
will give information against these people at my Section.\xE2\x80\x9D

The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the
citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded
her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and
hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.

Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to
the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:

\xE2\x80\x9CShe will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will
be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the
justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.
I will go to her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Jacques
Three, rapturously. \xE2\x80\x9CAh, my cherished!\xE2\x80\x9D cried The Vengeance; and
embraced her.

\xE2\x80\x9CTake you my knitting,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, placing it in her
lieutenant\xE2\x80\x99s hands, \xE2\x80\x9Cand have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep
me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual, to-day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI willingly obey the orders of my Chief,\xE2\x80\x9D said The Vengeance with
alacrity, and kissing her cheek. \xE2\x80\x9CYou will not be late?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall be there before the commencement.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,\xE2\x80\x9D said
The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the
street, \xE2\x80\x9Cbefore the tumbrils arrive!\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the
mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the
Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative
of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.

There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a
strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great
determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an
instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have
heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood
with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,
opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without
pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of
her.

It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that
his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was
insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and
her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had
been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had
been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent her there.

Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly
worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her
dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her
bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened
dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such
a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown
sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.

Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,
the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry\xE2\x80\x99s
attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their
escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.
Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross
and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at
three o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.
Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,
passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in
advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.

Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had
beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,
taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the
else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, whose agitation
was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:
\xE2\x80\x9Cwhat do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another
carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken
suspicion.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy opinion, miss,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Cruncher, \xE2\x80\x9Cis as you\xE2\x80\x99re right. Likewise
wot I\xE2\x80\x99ll stand by you, right or wrong.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Miss Pross, wildly crying, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I am incapable of forming any plan. Are
_you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRespectin\xE2\x80\x99 a future spear o\xE2\x80\x99 life, miss,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Cruncher, \xE2\x80\x9CI
hope so. Respectin\xE2\x80\x99 any present use o\xE2\x80\x99 this here blessed old head o\xE2\x80\x99
mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o\xE2\x80\x99
two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here
crisis?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, for gracious sake!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, \xE2\x80\x9Crecord
them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFirst,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with
an ashy and solemn visage, \xE2\x80\x9Cthem poor things well out o\xE2\x80\x99 this, never no
more will I do it, never no more!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you
never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, miss,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Jerry, \xE2\x80\x9Cit shall not be named to you. Second: them
poor things well out o\xE2\x80\x99 this, and never no more will I interfere with
Mrs. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s flopping, never no more!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross,
striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, \xE2\x80\x9CI have no doubt it
is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own
superintendence.--O my poor darlings!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI go so far as to say, miss, moreover,\xE2\x80\x9D proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a
most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--\xE2\x80\x9Cand let my words
be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my
opinions respectin\xE2\x80\x99 flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only
hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present
time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,\xE2\x80\x9D cried the distracted
Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I hope she finds it answering her expectations.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CForbid it,\xE2\x80\x9D proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,
additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out, \xE2\x80\x9Cas anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t all
flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get \xE2\x80\x98em out o\xE2\x80\x99 this here dismal
risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!\xE2\x80\x9D This was Mr. Cruncher\xE2\x80\x99s
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.

And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
nearer and nearer.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf we ever get back to our native land,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou may rely
upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and
understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events
you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr.
Cruncher, let us think!\xE2\x80\x9D

Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer
and nearer.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you were to go before,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cand stop the vehicle and
horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
that be best?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere could you wait for me?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Miss Pross.

Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame
Defarge was drawing very near indeed.

\xE2\x80\x9CBy the cathedral door,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross. \xE2\x80\x9CWould it be much out of
the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two
towers?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, miss,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Mr. Cruncher.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, like the best of men,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cgo to the posting-house
straight, and make that change.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am doubtful,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,
\xE2\x80\x9Cabout leaving of you, you see. We don\xE2\x80\x99t know what may happen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHeaven knows we don\xE2\x80\x99t,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut have no fear for me.
Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o\xE2\x80\x99Clock, or as near it as you can,
and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain
of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives
that may depend on both of us!\xE2\x80\x9D

This exordium, and Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he
immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself
to follow as she had proposed.

The having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty
minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.

Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,
which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she
could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.

The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of
Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,
those feet had come to meet that water.

Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CThe wife of Evremonde;
where is she?\xE2\x80\x9D

It flashed upon Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s mind that the doors were all standing open,
and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were
four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.

Madame Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,
and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful
about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,
of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different
way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss
Pross, in her breathing. \xE2\x80\x9CNevertheless, you shall not get the better of
me. I am an Englishwoman.\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of
Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight,
hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that
Miss Pross was the family\xE2\x80\x99s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well
that Madame Defarge was the family\xE2\x80\x99s malevolent enemy.

\xE2\x80\x9COn my way yonder,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhere they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I
wish to see her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know that your intentions are evil,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cand you may
depend upon it, I\xE2\x80\x99ll hold my own against them.\xE2\x80\x9D

Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other\xE2\x80\x99s words;
both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what
the unintelligible words meant.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge. \xE2\x80\x9CGood patriots will know what that means.
Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf those eyes of yours were bed-winches,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I
was an English four-poster, they shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t loose a splinter of me. No,
you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught.

\xE2\x80\x9CWoman imbecile and pig-like!\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge, frowning. \xE2\x80\x9CI take no
answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand
to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!\xE2\x80\x9D
 This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.

\xE2\x80\x9CI little thought,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,
except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any
part of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Neither of them for a single moment released the other\xE2\x80\x99s eyes. Madame
Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross
first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am a Briton,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9CI am desperate. I don\xE2\x80\x99t care an
English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the
greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I\xE2\x80\x99ll not leave a handful of that
dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!\xE2\x80\x9D

Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.
Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.

But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame
Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. \xE2\x80\x9CHa, ha!\xE2\x80\x9D she
laughed, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that
Doctor.\xE2\x80\x9D Then she raised her voice and called out, \xE2\x80\x9CCitizen Doctor! Wife
of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool,
answer the Citizeness Defarge!\xE2\x80\x9D

Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of Miss Pross\xE2\x80\x99s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.
Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.

\xE2\x80\x9CThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there
are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind
you! Let me look.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever!\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as
Madame Defarge understood the answer.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and
brought back,\xE2\x80\x9D said Madame Defarge to herself.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs long as you don\xE2\x80\x99t know whether they are in that room or not, you are
uncertain what to do,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross to herself; \xE2\x80\x9Cand you shall not
know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know
that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,
I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Madame Defarge.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are
not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,
while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
my darling,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross.

Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the
moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.
It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,
with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,
clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her
face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.

Soon, Madame Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled
waist. \xE2\x80\x9CIt is under my arm,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou
shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold
you till one or other of us faints or dies!\xE2\x80\x9D

Madame Defarge\xE2\x80\x99s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw
what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood
alone--blinded with smoke.

All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful
stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay lifeless on the ground.

In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the
body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of
what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to
go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to
get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on,
out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking
away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.

By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have
gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she
was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of
gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her
dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a
hundred ways.

In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving
at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there,
she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if
it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains
discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and
charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the
escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs there any noise in the streets?\xE2\x80\x9D she asked him.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe usual noises,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t hear you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you say?\xE2\x80\x9D

It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could
not hear him. \xE2\x80\x9CSo I\xE2\x80\x99ll nod my head,\xE2\x80\x9D thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, \xE2\x80\x9Cat
all events she\xE2\x80\x99ll see that.\xE2\x80\x9D And she did.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs there any noise in the streets now?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Miss Pross again,
presently.

Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t hear it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGone deaf in an hour?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind
much disturbed; \xE2\x80\x9Cwot\xE2\x80\x99s come to her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI feel,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, \xE2\x80\x9Cas if there had been a flash and a crash,
and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBlest if she ain\xE2\x80\x99t in a queer condition!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, more and
more disturbed. \xE2\x80\x9CWot can she have been a takin\xE2\x80\x99, to keep her courage up?
Hark! There\xE2\x80\x99s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can hear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, \xE2\x80\x9Cnothing. O,
my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,
and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf she don\xE2\x80\x99t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their
journey\xE2\x80\x99s end,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s my
opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.\xE2\x80\x9D

And indeed she never did.




XV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever


Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six
tumbrils carry the day\xE2\x80\x99s wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and
insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,
are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in
France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,
a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under
conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush
humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will
twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of
rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield
the same fruit according to its kind.

Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what
they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be
the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the
toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father\xE2\x80\x99s
house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!
No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order
of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. \xE2\x80\x9CIf thou be changed
into this shape by the will of God,\xE2\x80\x9D say the seers to the enchanted, in
the wise Arabian stories, \xE2\x80\x9Cthen remain so! But, if thou wear this
form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!\xE2\x80\x9D
 Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.

As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up
a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces
are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.
So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that
in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the
hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in
the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;
then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a
curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to
tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.

Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all
things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with
drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,
and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and
he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made
drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole
number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.

There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,
and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some
question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is
always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The
horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with
their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands
at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a
mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has
no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the
girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised
against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he
shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily
touch his face, his arms being bound.

On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands
the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there.
He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, \xE2\x80\x9CHas he
sacrificed me?\xE2\x80\x9D when his face clears, as he looks into the third.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich is Evremonde?\xE2\x80\x9D says a man behind him.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat. At the back there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith his hand in the girl\xE2\x80\x99s?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

The man cries, \xE2\x80\x9CDown, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats!
Down, Evremonde!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHush, hush!\xE2\x80\x9D the Spy entreats him, timidly.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd why not, citizen?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.
Let him be at peace.\xE2\x80\x9D

But the man continuing to exclaim, \xE2\x80\x9CDown, Evremonde!\xE2\x80\x9D the face of
Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then sees the
Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.

The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the
populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and
end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and
close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following
to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of
public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the
fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.

\xE2\x80\x9CTherese!\xE2\x80\x9D she cries, in her shrill tones. \xE2\x80\x9CWho has seen her? Therese
Defarge!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe never missed before,\xE2\x80\x9D says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; nor will she miss now,\xE2\x80\x9D cries The Vengeance, petulantly. \xE2\x80\x9CTherese.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLouder,\xE2\x80\x9D the woman recommends.

Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear
thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet
it will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,
lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread
deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her!

\xE2\x80\x9CBad Fortune!\xE2\x80\x9D cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, \xE2\x80\x9Cand
here are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and
she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for
her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!\xE2\x80\x9D

As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are
robed and ready. Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who
scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
think and speak, count One.

The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!--And
the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.

The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next
after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but
still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the
crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into
his face and thanks him.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am
naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been
able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might
have hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by
Heaven.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COr you to me,\xE2\x80\x9D says Sydney Carton. \xE2\x80\x9CKeep your eyes upon me, dear child,
and mind no other object.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let
it go, if they are rapid.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey will be rapid. Fear not!\xE2\x80\x9D

The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as
if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to
heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart
and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home
together, and to rest in her bosom.

\xE2\x80\x9CBrave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I
am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTell me what it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I
love very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a
farmer\xE2\x80\x99s house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows
nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I
tell her! It is better as it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, yes: better as it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still
thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support, is this:--If the Republic really does good to the poor,
and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may
live a long time: she may even live to be old.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat then, my gentle sister?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you think:\xE2\x80\x9D the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:
\xE2\x80\x9Cthat it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land
where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now? Is the
moment come?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.
The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than
a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before
him--is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.\xE2\x80\x9D

The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing
on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells
forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.
Twenty-Three.

        *****

They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the
peacefullest man\xE2\x80\x99s face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked
sublime and prophetic.

One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked
at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to
write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any
utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:

\xE2\x80\x9CI see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge,
long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of
the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease
out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in
their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil
of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural
birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.

\xE2\x80\x9CI see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful,
prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see
Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father,
aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his
healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long their
friend, in ten years\xE2\x80\x99 time enriching them with all he has, and passing
tranquilly to his reward.

\xE2\x80\x9CI see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of
their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping
for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their
course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know
that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other\xE2\x80\x99s soul,
than I was in the souls of both.

\xE2\x80\x9CI see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him
winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him,
fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name,
with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place--then fair to
look upon, with not a trace of this day\xE2\x80\x99s disfigurement--and I hear him
tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a
far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDefects,\xE2\x80\x9D such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xE2\x80\x99s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
