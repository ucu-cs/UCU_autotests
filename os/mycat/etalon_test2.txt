FOREWORD


The dry wit of the New England Yankee has done much to cheer the Lonely
Traveler on his way. It has oiled the thinking machinery when it
creaked and provided inspiration for that spontaneous good fellowship
which helps so much to make life worth living.

The following pages are not the product of an overworked imagination,
but a record of actual happenings. The characters who pass in review
before the reader are real personages whose various experiences have
gladdened many adjacent firesides.

However, the author realizes that certain serious and literal souls are
so constructed that what to others is a source of glee and merriment,
is to them but \xE2\x80\x9Cthe crackling of thorns under a pot.\xE2\x80\x9D Hence the origin
of his conscientious plan to display in the book\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cshow window,\xE2\x80\x9D so to
speak, a sample of the brand of Yankee humor the reader may expect to
find should he resolve to read further.

Therefore, let us turn aside from these gracious words of the author as
above and consider for a moment the soliloquy of Uncle Andrew Cheney,
who did not like his son-in-law.

Uncle Andrew did not like work very well either, which is often
unfortunate for a husband and father of a family. In view of his own
impecunious state, it was peculiarly annoying to him to continually
be witnessing the lavish display of an elderly neighbor who had
considerable inherited property, but, who though a long time married,
was childless.

One summer evening Uncle Andrew was sitting disconsolately on the steps
of the little country grocery store, when he heard the clatter of
horses\xE2\x80\x99 feet and saw the well-to-do neighbor driving by with his pair
of high stepping colts. Uncle Andrew scowled but said nothing. Again
came the thud of feet and the horses and proud driver, coming back up
the country road, once more passed the store. Uncle Andrew glowered at
the spectacle with increasing disgust, but still managed to restrain
himself.

A third time the gay equipage swept past. This was too much and Uncle
Andrew, deeply stirred, began to talk to himself. A neighbor, sitting
near was the only listener, but what he heard he considered well worth
repeating.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Yes,\xE2\x80\x9D Uncle Andrew muttered. \xE2\x80\x9CYou are a mighty smart man, you are.
And you\xE2\x80\x99ve got some fine hosses, too.\xE2\x80\x9D

A gleam came in his eye.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a smart man, but I\xE2\x80\x99ve got one thing you haven\xE2\x80\x99t got and never
will have; and that\xE2\x80\x99s the biggest liar for a son-in-law there is in
this county.\xE2\x80\x9D

CHAPTER I

SHOWING SOME GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS


When the young business man or girl stenographer who has grown up
in one of the innumerable thriving towns or cities of the broad
Mississippi Valley, scans the morning paper on the way to the daily
task and reads of the incidental happenings duly chronicled as New
England News, there may perhaps be a glance of the mind\xE2\x80\x99s eye at
that little corner of the map of the United States as revealed in
the not remote school days. Then it was necessary, if one would be
on harmonious terms with the teacher, to at least memorize the state
capitals of Vermont, New Hampshire, and little Rhode Island, as well
as those of the somewhat much more imposing looking states of Maine,
Massachusetts, and Connecticut. And how small and insignificant they
all looked compared with the rest of the map!

It is true that geographies of good standing are not supposed to
deceive, but it is doubtful if any of them ever quite did justice to
the northeast corner of the U. S. of America.

And when, as sometimes happens in these modern times, the young
business man marries the little stenographer and by industry and
intelligence becomes prosperous, there is a desire for the well earned
holiday. He and the girl stenographer now become a matron, if permitted
choice, are impelled to explore that same little corner of the earth
so shabbily set forth by the map, but so attractively described by
acquaintances who have toured that section in summer.

And perhaps they will repeat these visits and view many smiling
valleys and listen to the soothing lullabies of the surf by night and
to unconvincing statements of hotel clerks by day--and yet will have
missed the most satisfying and illuminating characteristic of New
England--contact with the real typical New England Yankee.

Nowhere on earth does the aphorism that appearances are often deceitful
more frequently prove to be true than in New England, especially in
the rural districts. The impressive appearing motorist displaying
the now familiar license tag of the region may be a local tradesman
rated in the commercial register as \xE2\x80\x9Ccapital $500 to $1000, credit
limited.\xE2\x80\x9D Just behind in a cloud of dust the carelessly dressed man in
shabby looking buggy drawn by a placid old horse, may own a fine farm,
many pedigreed cattle and possess in addition an abundance of reserve
cash with which to take advantage of any favorable opportunity for
investment. While the apparel may \xE2\x80\x9Coft portray the man,\xE2\x80\x9D it is far from
being an infallible test in New England. Even when the native of this
region is transplanted to some bustling city, he is prone to develop
carelessness in dress as prosperity steals upon him.

       *       *       *       *       *

The native resident who remarks casually that the New England climate
consists of \xE2\x80\x9Cnine months winter and three months late in the fall,\xE2\x80\x9D
is not probably making any plans to remove elsewhere. He is taking
a sardonic pleasure in making it clear that he is laboring under no
delusions as to what the seasons will reveal in the months to come. He
makes no attempt to gloss over the enormities of the midwinter season,
but indeed seems to take much satisfaction in quoting the below zero
records which make a Philadelphian, for instance, gasp with horror.


Overlooked by Tourists

A sturdy woman of middle age, who had been born and raised in a
northern New England region, was chatting with a traveler about some
recent extremely cold weather and told him that the temperature at her
home had gone down to about 38 degrees below zero. As he expressed
some interest she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cover in the next town it was 46 below.\xE2\x80\x9D Upon
noting the surprise occasioned by this statement she hastened to say
that it was 52 below at the same time in another town about twenty
miles distant. She then assumed an expression of great candor and
proceeded, \xE2\x80\x9CMy daughter, who lives about ten miles beyond that place,
wrote that their thermometer registered 58 degrees below zero.\xE2\x80\x9D

She was a truthful woman and a good Methodist. The abashed listener
hastily changed the subject.

Stories of such extreme cold seem to be exaggerated, to strangers who
have traveled these districts in ordinary winter weather, but it is
merely exceptional rather than impossible. To people of normal health
such cold waves are merely an unpleasant incident. Those of experience
will insist that on the average the winter of even, steady cold is
healthier than the warm ones.

While there is, of course, a temptation to elderly people of means
to spend their winters in some warmer section, there are plenty of
instances on record to prove that it is usually better to \xE2\x80\x9Cstick
it out\xE2\x80\x9D at home, unless of course the change of climate is to be
permanent. Withstanding the cold develops vigor for the relaxing days
of spring and summer. Besides, in this matter as in many others, it is
evident that nature abhors a quitter.


\xE2\x80\x9CYear Before Last Winter\xE2\x80\x99s Snow\xE2\x80\x9D

It is the winter of unusually deep snows that stimulates the Yankee
sense of humor. An early summer visitor driving through a deep gorge,
scarcely touched at any part of the day by sunshine, found a man busily
shoveling snow which had evidently drifted deep across the road.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must have had lots of snow here last winter,\xE2\x80\x9D he remarked as he
drove by.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! no,\xE2\x80\x9D was the reply, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is winter before last\xE2\x80\x99s snow.\xE2\x80\x9D


The School Master and His Snow Grave

Among the legends clustering about a little country schoolhouse is a
comedy in which deep snow furnished the motif and more literally the
environment. An earnest young college student who was self-supporting,
secured the privilege of teaching the winter term of school. Among
his pupils were several husky youths to whom burning the midnight oil
made little appeal. It soon became evident to the parents that the
well-meaning but somewhat diffident teacher was destined for trouble.
A tremendous snowfall with high drifts brought events to a climax.
While the teacher was away for his lunch at the noon hour, the boys
dug a deep \xE2\x80\x9Cgrave\xE2\x80\x9D in a snowdrift near the schoolhouse, and when their
unsuspecting victim approached he was promptly seized, and in spite of
his struggles, placed in the grave and lightly sprinkled with snow.
Needless to say he was glad to resign his position and make way for a
successor of probably less education but considerably more muscle.

       *       *       *       *       *

The successive snow storms often bring about a condition of the back
roads that makes traveling difficult in the latter part of the winter.
Under these conditions it is an unwritten law that as compared with
those who travel light, the heavily loaded team shall have the right of
way. On a certain occasion this custom was peremptorily challenged.


Drifted Roads and the Right of Way

Two families of the neighborhood were far from friendly. Two brothers
of one of these uncongenial families returning home from town with a
horse and sleigh chanced to meet the robust scion of the other family
with two horses and a big sled loaded with logs. Instead of yielding
to the work team as precedent required, these young hopefuls demanded
half of the roadway. Although fully appreciating the personal motive in
this action, the driver of the log team blandly explained that if he
were to turn his horses into the soft deep snow by the roadside, his
load would be stuck in the drift. Interpreting this explanation as an
evidence of timidity, one of the young men jumped from the sleigh and
taking the two team horses by the bridles, started to turn them into
the drift. The driver was quick as well as athletic and in a very few
seconds a three cornered fist-fight was well under way. It was short
and decisive, after which the two brothers meekly turned their horse
and sleigh out into the snow drifts, passed the load of logs and went
home. The scarlet evidence of bloody noses in the snow soon faded, but
numerous firesides were cheered by the story which soon went the rounds
of the neighborhood.

While the rural midwinter season tends to physical inactivity, the
Yankee sense of humor is apparently stimulated. It may be said,
however, that while the sarcastic brand of humor is not popular,
occasionally some \xE2\x80\x9Cdeep thinker\xE2\x80\x9D will evolve an intricate plot like the
following.


The Post Holes in the Ice

In a certain community there was a newly hired farm hand whose
ingenuous innocence was a constant temptation. A young blacksmith
found out that the farm hand was especially fond of trotting races. He
accordingly proceeded to elaborate on a mythical trotting meet that was
supposed to soon take place on the lake. The stranger\xE2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled.
That was something like the real life. He asked what it was going to
cost to see the races. The blacksmith named a very high figure, but
hastily reassured the young man that it would be easy for him to secure
a season ticket if he would help to get things in readiness. The farm
hand eagerly agreed and asked what he could do. The blacksmith told
him that of course there would have to be a board fence around the
ice track and that it would be necessary to dig post holes in the ice,
indicating the section of the lake where the fence must be built.
The next morning the confiding hired man got a day off and promptly
proceeded to the lake, devoting several hours to the laborious task of
post hole digging before someone\xE2\x80\x99s curiosity led to an investigation
and the disillusionment of the victim.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is not characteristic of the normal New England mind to dwell upon
that which is somber. That trend of mind which contemplates with
satisfaction the gloomy and funereal, never fails to create amusement
among normal Yankees.


The Man Who Took Comfort at Funerals

There is an old time story of the eccentric old bachelor who lived with
his married brother, a bustling person of numerous activities, noted
for a propensity to begin many enterprises but seldom finish them. Poor
\xE2\x80\x9CHamp,\xE2\x80\x9D the bachelor, was constantly being speeded up at the endless
jobs. One day he announced his intention to take an afternoon vacation
and attend a funeral. His taskmaster objected.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy do you want to go to that funeral? You went to one only last week
and you never were acquainted with either of the families.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHamp\xE2\x80\x9D hesitated a moment. A half day\xE2\x80\x99s release seemed wonderfully
inviting.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, to tell the truth,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cabout all the comfort I take is in
going to funerals.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

The grim visaged old farmer who sits with bent shoulders guiding his
slow moving pair of farm horses along the dusty road, reflects the
stern realities of making ends meet--and perhaps a little bit more--as
the tiller of a rocky New England farm. But the smartly dressed tourist
may have far less of that mental flexibility which enables one to shift
the processes of thought from that which is burdensome to that which
renews the cheerfulness of youth. As an example of this capacity there
is the incident of the field of oats.


The Story of the Field of Oats

A farmer was standing by the roadside looking disconsolately at his oat
field which he somehow seemed to feel was a personal reproach. A cold
wet season had had a most discouraging influence and there was promise
of but a very small crop.

Along the highway came a well-known elderly citizen who would be sure
to notice the oats and estimate them for just what they were worth.
He stopped his horse and passed the customary salutations and seeming
in no hurry, the conversation covered quite a range of local topics.
The owner of the oat field began to breathe easier. Perhaps this man
had not noticed the oats. He exerted himself to be agreeable to the
traveler. The latter finally straightened his reins. The patient horse
began to look expectant, slowly started up and then the blow fell, but
not on the horse. His driver gave a comprehensive glance across the
field.

\xE2\x80\x9CYour oats,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Care short--but thin.\xE2\x80\x9D

For the benefit of the uninitiated it might be said that it is
perfectly possible to secure a fairly satisfactory yield of oats even
if in short stalk, provided that there is a thick stand. From the
foregoing it will be evident that the outlook in this case was very
unfavorable.

       *       *       *       *       *

Monotony is supposed, by those enlightened ones of the earth who reside
in large cities, to be inevitably associated with rural life, but youth
can generally be depended upon to provide a thrill now and then, even
in the back woods.


The Kitchen Dance \xE2\x80\x9CUp the Branch\xE2\x80\x9D

One evening in late winter, three enterprising young men in search of
diversion, decided to hire a horse and sleigh and attend a dance, which
by some underground source they had heard was scheduled for that date
at a farmhouse some three or four miles away \xE2\x80\x9Cup the Branch.\xE2\x80\x9D

Now, of course, the code of etiquette required these young gallants to
engage a barge, pair of horses and driver and also invite three young
ladies to accompany them. But funds were scarce with them and relying
upon what is now known as \xE2\x80\x9Cnerve,\xE2\x80\x9D they felt sure they could secure
dancing partners among the girls who would be sure to be present.

Driving up to the door of the farmhouse with a flourish, they turned
their horse over to the volunteer hostlers and joined the party. As
they were good dancers and not burdened with bashfulness, they were
not long in making acquaintances among the girls present and were soon
enjoying themselves greatly. To be sure they noticed a marked lack of
cordiality among the other boys, but they did not allow so trifling a
matter as that to disturb them.

All pleasures came to an end and about three o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the morning it
occurred to the three young heroes, that as each of them was expected
to be \xE2\x80\x9Con the job\xE2\x80\x9D that morning, it would be well to start for home and
get a little sleep. So they called for their horse and making graceful
acknowledgments to the young ladies for the pleasures of the occasion,
they put on their top coats and took their places in the sleigh.

The horse was quite restive and apparently in much haste to start. One
of the trio took the reins and the volunteer hostler, giving the horse
his head, they started at a fast pace homeward.

It was very dark and deep snows of the winter, now mostly melted away,
had left a rather uneven roadbed. There were frequent deep depressions
into which the rapidly moving sleigh would sink with nerve-racking
concussions. One of the passengers protested to the driver.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s the use in driving so fast?\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CMy teeth are all getting
loose.\xE2\x80\x9D

The driver tugged on the reins.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t understand the nature of the beast,\xE2\x80\x9D he said. \xE2\x80\x9CHere, get hold
of the reins with me and see if we can\xE2\x80\x99t make him slow down a little.\xE2\x80\x9D

They tugged at the reins with all their combined strength, but
apparently it only made the horse go faster. Accordingly they gave
their principal attention to getting through the \xE2\x80\x9Ccradle holes\xE2\x80\x9D with
as little shock as possible. The fast pace of the horse was rapidly
bringing them toward their home town and they soon saw the street
lights. The horse evidently had but one object and that was to get the
job over with and reach the stable and his own comfortable stall.

Moving down a long street at a very fast pace, the horse made a sudden
sharp turn toward his stable. The sleigh, skidding violently across
the wide, icy street, struck the curb and capsized, throwing the three
heroes of the dance out upon the sidewalk together with the sleigh
robes and other equipment.

The horse, with the sleigh still attached, then dashed up the street at
a mad gallop toward the stable.

Gathering themselves up, somewhat shaken and bruised, but not seriously
marred by their experience, the devoted three picked up the robes and
blankets and made their limping way to the stable.

They found the horse and somewhat shattered sleigh being inspected by a
much disgusted looking stable man.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s the matter with you fellows, anyway?\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t you know
enough to harness a horse?\xE2\x80\x9D

The light of the lantern solved the mystery of the wild ride home from
the dance. The obliging volunteer hostler had carefully refrained from
putting the bit in the horse\xE2\x80\x99s mouth.

After paying the bill for damages sustained by the sleigh, the young
adventurers decided that the boys \xE2\x80\x9Cup the Branch\xE2\x80\x9D had evened the score.


The New Maple Sugar Tub

Not far from the scenes of the above comedy, there lived on a little
farm, an elderly man of very thrifty habits. He took great pride in the
maple sugar he produced. Deciding to have the family supply all in one
large receptacle, he had a can made by a local tinsmith to contain two
or three hundred pounds of the finest maple sugar. This was filled at
the proper season and stored in an attic at the head of a long flight
of stairs. Several people of the vicinity were invited to inspect that
new sugar tub and its contents.

One day a great misfortune came to the farm. The house caught on fire.
There was very little water available with which to fight it and it
made rapid headway. It was soon evident that there was no hope of
saving the building, so sympathetic neighbors helped to remove such of
the contents of the house as could be carried out before it was too
late. The old man was naturally much broken up and while they were
looking upon the ruins, expressed his regret that he had lost that tub
of sugar. Someone said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought you were up there in the attic. Why didn\xE2\x80\x99t you roll it down
stairs?\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man turned a rueful countenance and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought of doing that, but I was afraid it would jam the tub up to
let it bump down those stairs.\xE2\x80\x9D


A Yankee Philanthropist

And now by contrast with the simple soul who took such pride in his
new, shiny, sugar tub, there is the story of another type of Yankee
whose business shrewdness had made him a marked man in the community,
even in the days of comparative youth. Cool, calculating and with
unerring judgment, all his various enterprises prospered, and he
was looked upon with wholesome respect as a man who lived up to his
contracts and expected the same of others. This man shipped livestock
to the Boston market and on a certain warm day in midsummer was to
send away a carload of fat hogs collected from the surrounding farm
neighborhood.

It is important that fat hogs intended for shipment be kept cool. Among
those who appeared at the proper time to make delivery, was a man from
a little farm away up on the mountain top. He had a very fat hog which
promised to weigh heavily and produce a handsome financial return.
Somehow he had been careless and allowed the hog to make the journey
in the hot sun without sufficient protection. At the first glance the
experienced buyer saw the hog was overcome with the heat and told the
owner that he could not accept it. The poor farmer was stupefied but an
inspection of the sick porker showed him that the shipper was justified
in his rejection. He was very much cast down and said that he had been
depending upon the proceeds of that hog to meet a pressing obligation.
The shrewd Yankee buyer in his cool imperturbable manner noting his
distress, turned to his assistant:

\xE2\x80\x9CHarry,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cmake out a check for the amount as per weigh bill,\xE2\x80\x9D
which was promptly done.

The check was handed over to the farmer and he was instructed to
take the hog, now in a state of collapse, to a remote corner of the
adjoining meadow, kill and bury it.

And yet, had anyone accused the hog buyer of being a philanthropist, he
would have resented the idea promptly.

       *       *       *       *       *

Another instance of philanthropy, bearing upon the same important
article of commerce, left a somewhat different impression.


The Butcher Who Was Too Generous

In a certain thriving town a meat dealer had gradually acquired a wide
acquaintance. As he was a genial man with a ready sense of humor, he
was regarded with general favor by outlying farmers as well as by his
local customers.

A man who had a farm back on the hills came to this dealer one day
and contracted to deliver to him on a certain date an unusually fine
specimen of dressed pork, guaranteed to be as near perfection as the
most fastidious customer could require.

The appointed day arrived and likewise the farmer and the hog, which
being placed upon the scales presented an attractive picture, at least
from the standpoint of those who like pork. The dealer seemed well
pleased.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy wife said it was a shame for me to sell this hog,\xE2\x80\x9D said the farmer
as the dealer started to adjust the scales, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe said she wanted that
hog\xE2\x80\x99s head for \xE2\x80\x98sowse.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! she did,\xE2\x80\x9D said the dealer, \xE2\x80\x9Cwell, I will make her a present of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

The butcher immediately proceeded to decapitate the hog and wrapping
the head up in coarse brown paper, handed it over to the delighted
farmer who was overwhelmed at such unexpected generosity. The butcher
then weighing the hog, figured a moment on a slip of paper and turning
to the till counted out the amount coming for the meat at the agreed
upon rate.

When the farmer handed the hog\xE2\x80\x99s head to his much surprised spouse she
inquired:

\xE2\x80\x9CHow much did the hog weigh?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt didn\xE2\x80\x99t seem to weigh up as much as I expected,\xE2\x80\x9D said the farmer. \xE2\x80\x9CI
thought it would weigh twenty-five or thirty pounds more than it did.\xE2\x80\x9D

The woman looked at her husband suspiciously.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid the butcher weigh the hog before or after he cut off the head?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe weighed it afterwards.\xE2\x80\x9D

The comments of the wife when she found out the real significance of
the \xE2\x80\x9Cpresent\xE2\x80\x9D she had received, may be imagined. The value of the head
would normally be about one third as much by the pound as the entire
carcass.




CHAPTER II

RELATING TO CERTAIN CONJUGAL INFELICITIES


The capacity of New England housewives for self-sacrificing devotion to
family has been made evident by many a biographical history of favorite
sons. When the father and mother are both united in the common purpose
of giving their children opportunities which were perhaps almost wholly
denied to themselves, it is seldom that serious conjugal differences
arise.

But, unfortunately, there are some whose natural good intentions are
easily undermined by their distaste for that monotony so commonly
associated with carrying out any worth-while plan.


Why Dave Left Home

In a certain rural district there was a man known familiarly to his
acquaintances as \xE2\x80\x9CDave.\xE2\x80\x9D He had a wife and several children, also a
small farm. To all appearances Dave and his rather unprepossessing
appearing wife lived on amicable terms. Both were frugal, industrious,
and regarded as well meaning people. Therefore it was with great
surprise that the community learned that Dave had disappeared under
circumstances that admitted of no doubt that he had acted deliberately.

Although badly upset by Dave\xE2\x80\x99s unwarranted action, his wife was
determined to keep her little family together and carry on the farm
as a means of support. Admiring her grit the neighbors showed their
kindness in many helpful ways and thus encouraged, the deserted family
managed to complete the yearly cycle in tolerable comfort.

During all this time Dave\xE2\x80\x99s disappearance was a continual source of
conjecture to the neighborhood. Nothing had been heard of him since
that early morning when he had been seen walking rapidly down the road
a mile or two away from home.

One evening a man who lived on a farm adjoining the one now being
conducted by Mrs. Dave, was reading the weekly newspaper. Suddenly
there was a faint tapping at a nearby window. Laying down his paper
the farmer proceeded to raise the sash. Seeing no one he asked who
had rapped. There was a hesitating step forward and a shadowy figure
appeared.

\xE2\x80\x9CSay,\xE2\x80\x9D said the visitor, \xE2\x80\x9Ccan\xE2\x80\x99t you put on your hat and walk over home
with me? It\xE2\x80\x99s me, Dave. I\xE2\x80\x99ve just got back and I\xE2\x80\x99d feel a little easier
about showing up to the Old Lady if you were along.\xE2\x80\x9D

So modest a request could hardly be denied. So the neighbor helped to
restore Dave to the tolerance if not the good graces of his wife. On
the way to his unsuspecting family, Dave was apologetically garrulous,
explaining how he had been working some distance away and could not
very well leave his job. As he rambled on making an evident attempt to
excuse himself, his companion\xE2\x80\x99s patience became exhausted and he turned
to Dave with the logical question to be asked by any honorable citizen.

\xE2\x80\x9CDave,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s all very well that you have been telling me,
but what I want to know is, how you could sneak off the way you did
and leave your family?\xE2\x80\x9D

Dave hesitated and then proceeded to pass out an excuse that probably
caused more local feminine indignation than the actual sin of
abandonment had ever done in all the surrounding region.

\xE2\x80\x9CI guess it was a kind of mean trick,\xE2\x80\x9D said Dave. \xE2\x80\x9CThat morning I went
off I had no real notion of going. But you see after I had got up, got
dressed, and started the fire, I happened to look in the bedroom where
my wife was lying asleep, hair all frowzy, mouth wide open, and snoring
so you could hear her out in the road.\xE2\x80\x9D

Dave hesitated.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe looked so awful homely I just felt as if I
couldn\xE2\x80\x99t stand it any longer.\xE2\x80\x9D

It is probable that having variously contributed to supplying the needs
of the abandoned family for an entire year, the indignant women before
mentioned were careful not to express their views in the hearing of
Dave\xE2\x80\x99s wife. At any rate the historian mentions no further gaps in the
family happiness. So it may be assumed that the couple lived in perfect
accord thereafter.

       *       *       *       *       *

And now, having brought this episode to a delightful ending, it is the
more to be regretted that another rupture of conjugal domesticity had
a very different conclusion. In this case it was the beloved wife who
wandered from home and fireside.


The Discouraging Matrimonial Experiences of Bill Jordan

A middle-aged man of good habits but limited executive ability had
acquired a small farm on which he lived and kept house for himself. It
was a very uneventful life but \xE2\x80\x9CBill\xE2\x80\x9D was well seasoned to monotony. As
frequently happens this monotony was suddenly interrupted, and as might
also be expected, by a woman. Although of unknown antecedents, the lady
was bland and ingratiating. She seemed to discover many attractive
qualities in Bill which he had never dreamed of possessing heretofore.
It is unnecessary to linger over details. A wedding took place at an
extremely early date.

Life now seemed worth living and Bill was a happy man. His wife was
a good cook and he was a good provider. But somehow the wife did not
seem to enjoy her husband\xE2\x80\x99s society exclusively and began to make other
acquaintances chiefly of the male persuasion. Among them was a gay and
debonair widower known as \xE2\x80\x9CJim\xE2\x80\x9D who appeared to have much more leisure
than Bill had. And when Jim struck out some time later to secure a
better paying job in another state, Mrs. Bill decided to go along too.

Bill made no attempt to trace the missing couple, but went back to
the old way of living without complaint. When friends told him he
was well rid of such a baggage, Bill thought of the good suppers she
used to get for him and was mute. For months nothing was heard of the
missing spouse, but at last there were developments which can perhaps
be best explained in the language of a faithful friend of Bill\xE2\x80\x99s, a
French-Canadian, named \xE2\x80\x9CJoe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI seen Bill on the street and I say to him: \xE2\x80\x98Bill, what makes you look
so glum; your wife come back?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98No,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D Bill say, \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98he ain\xE2\x80\x99t come back no more; he dead.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI say, \xE2\x80\x98Aw gwan, Bill! What makes you tink he dead?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98I seen heem on der paper.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI say, \xE2\x80\x98Aw you don\xE2\x80\x99t want ter believe all you see in der paper, Bill.
Dey got to print some lies for fill heem up.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

It appeared that Bill had that morning received a letter from some
alleged friend of the strayed woman which contained a clipping
mentioning the decease of Mrs. Bill and requesting that forty dollars
be advanced for burial expenses, a sum modestly designed to come within
the financial capacity of the bereaved husband.

Greatly against the advice of his friend, Joe, Bill insisted on
forwarding the forty dollars, after which he resumed his daily routine
of attending to his farm and cooking his meals. And again after many
months was the same routine interrupted.

One afternoon just as Bill had kindled a new fire in the cook stove,
so that his supper could be preparing while he was milking his cows,
there came a rapping at the door, which being opened revealed the
presence of Mrs. Bill, very much alive and wearing the smile which had
been so attractive while it lasted. Naturally there were explanations
to be made, but Mrs. Bill soon made it apparent that she had been a
sad victim of deception. And when she told Bill to go along and do his
milking and she would show him the best supper on his table that he had
seen since she went away, Bill was ready to let bygones be bygones. He
went to the barn and hustled his various duties, not even grudging the
forty dollars of which he had been beguiled for the flimflam funeral.
But his jubilation was short lived. No delicious supper was awaiting
his return. His wife was missing; likewise forty-six dollars in the
bureau drawer which Bill had been carefully saving up little by little
for taxes.

Thus did romance fade, and while it must be admitted that in this
depressing narrative of a woman\xE2\x80\x99s guile there are many suggestions
of humor, it is a sordid tale at best. But in another instance of
sadly impaired confidence, the victim\xE2\x80\x99s faith in a faithless wife was
restored to remain unshaken, thus establishing in concrete form the
formula that ignorance can really be bliss of a certain quality at
least.


Another Tale of a Confiding Husband

Hosea W-- was the possessor of a small property left to him by his
deceased wife who had inherited it from a notoriously frugal father.
Hosea was an amiable, simple minded person of very limited earning
capacity. Noting his loneliness after his wife\xE2\x80\x99s death, Hosea was
marked out as a worth-while \xE2\x80\x9Cprospect\xE2\x80\x9D by a widow, to whom to apply
the term \xE2\x80\x9Cdesigning\xE2\x80\x9D would be very inadequate indeed. Of a gracious
personality and a keen intellect, it was probably only because of a
reluctance to leave familiar scenes that she failed to become another
Cassie Chadwick.

As before stated, the widow classified Hosea as being worth her
consideration. He had certain small possessions, including a home,
and she was practically without a penny. To resolve was to act.
The conquest was easy and before the community had any more than a
suspicion of the real situation, the marriage knot had been tied.

To have a real home of her own after years of poverty was an agreeable
change. But there was a fly in the ointment. Although an adoring
husband, Hosea was not only vacant minded, but very economical. The
honeymoon, while a rapturous state of affairs to Hosea, became very
insipid to his broadly experienced wife. She resolved upon a solution
that would both rid herself of a tiresomely ardent husband and give her
possession of his property.

She thereupon began to take careful note of certain eccentricities
frequently revealed by her spouse. With the data thus collected, she
succeeded in persuading a physician that Hosea was in urgent need of
mental treatment and secured a certificate to that effect.

The next move was to take the unsuspecting husband on a little tour.
Among the interesting towns visited was one in which was located a
well-known retreat for the insane. The gracious bride suggested that
they inspect the asylum. Shortly thereafter the husband found himself
deprived of both wife and liberty.

News of this astonishing transaction spread rapidly. Indignation
developed everywhere among old friends and neighbors. They said Hosea
was foolish enough without doubt or he would never have married the
widow, but that he was no more crazy now than he had always been.
Application was made for a writ of _habeas corpus_ and within a very
few days the victim was set at liberty.

This rapid change in the order of events was made possible by the
fact that the county court was in session. After Hosea had appeared
before the judge he received quite an ovation. One by one his friends
congratulated him on having not only escaped from a nasty situation,
but on having also plenty of evidence on which to base the divorce
suit which was to follow.

Hosea expressed his gratitude for having such vigilant friends.
He would send his wife packing in record time. Well pleased with
themselves, the self-sacrificing neighbors returned to their various
homes, picturing to each other the discomfiture of the widow, but they
reckoned without their host.

A few days later the news was handed about that Hosea and the widow had
\xE2\x80\x9Cmade up.\xE2\x80\x9D She had convinced him that it was all a mistake. Love had
conquered.

       *       *       *       *       *

To consider this chapter complete at this stage would be to leave a
somewhat painful impression upon the reader. This is as unnecessary as
it is undesirable. In order therefore that this history of conjugal
vicissitudes be made to reflect in greater accuracy that noble
institution of matrimony, as it really is in so many happy households,
let us speak of the experience of another agriculturalist known
familiarly to his associates as a well disposed, amiable citizen with
an exceedingly capable wife and promising family.


\xE2\x80\x9CPurty Bur-r-ds\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJim\xE2\x80\x9D lived on very harmonious terms with his better half, but he had
one bad habit. When he had occasion to visit a nearby village for
supplies, he was apt to linger rather late. Under these circumstances,
his wife, with a proper understanding of the necessity of regularity in
farm details, would milk the cows. It is not of course to be expected
that she did this very willingly, but she would do it if the occasion
seemed to require it.

Late one evening in autumn, an acquaintance of Jim\xE2\x80\x99s, passing by his
establishment, was surprised to see Jim driving his cows in from the
pasture, same being presumptive evidence that they had not been milked.
As he passed the gateway he met Jim face to face.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt seems to me you are pretty late getting in your cows, Jim,\xE2\x80\x9D was the
remark.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s pretty late. I have just got back from town.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you have to milk \xE2\x80\x99em all yourself?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim, \xE2\x80\x9Cme wife can milk if she\xE2\x80\x99s a mind to.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s the matter tonight?\xE2\x80\x9D was the natural query.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! she\xE2\x80\x99s mad at me tonight,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe says she\xE2\x80\x99s good and tired
of doing the milkin\xE2\x80\x99 and me loafin\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x99round the town.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Jim,\xE2\x80\x9D said the traveler, who knew Mrs. Jim and admired her
spunk, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen the women get their backs up we have to do about as they
say.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s right ye are,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim, \xE2\x80\x9Cthey know how to raise the divil
himself when they feel that way. They are purty bur-r-ds but they have
their outs!\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

It will be noted by the reader that Jim accepted the inevitable which
was certainly the proper attitude. Every normal husband appreciates
the fact that the advantages of matrimony greatly outweigh any
associated drawbacks. In fact there is an occasional husband who seems
to appreciate it too much, which is abundantly illustrated in another
legend of rural New England, long since forgotten by most of the local
inhabitants.


\xE2\x80\x9CSeven Wives and Seven Prisons\xE2\x80\x9D

A young woman had continued to linger in the parental household until
she had considerably passed the average age of marriage. Somehow the
young men of her acquaintance had failed to appreciate her. Therefore
it was all the more gratifying when a recent arrival in the community,
a man of ingratiating appearance, began to pay her marked attentions.
Her romantic impulses which had been subdued by untoward circumstances,
could now be given full sway. Her admirer was impetuous and would hear
of no delays, and they were soon married.

The historian does not furnish any details of the honeymoon nor how
long it lasted, but it would appear that the bride, although of a
clinging nature, was very curious as to her husband\xE2\x80\x99s antecedents, and
this, unfortunately, was the weak spot in his armour. The more the
aforesaid antecedents were investigated, the more unattractive they
proved to be and within a very short time the bride indignantly refused
to have any further dealings with her husband, incidentally starting
a line of inquiry with startling results; the man was apparently a
bigamist.

With indefatigable zeal, the bride and her disgusted parents continued
their investigations which soon resulted in the bridegroom being snugly
established in the local jail.

Then followed a remarkable series of revelations. A wife was discovered
at about every turn in the crooked path of the prisoner, who engaged a
lawyer and resigned himself to the inevitable.

Some months were to elapse before a regular session of court and in
the meantime the bridegroom found time hanging heavily on his hands.
Apparently the game was up and, with the inordinate vanity of certain
criminal minds, he decided to write an autobiography. In due course
of time there appeared a remarkable book, entitled, \xE2\x80\x9CSeven Wives and
Seven Prisons,\xE2\x80\x9D which created a sensation. It also aroused much local
feminine indignation, because, in his desire to \xE2\x80\x9Cget even\xE2\x80\x9D with his
last wife, whom he regarded as responsible for his present misfortunes,
the bigamist declared in his book that of all the wives he had ever
had, she was not only the most disagreeable, but also the homeliest and
the most generally unattractive.

Apparently masculine depravity could go no further.


The French-Canadian Who Wanted a \xE2\x80\x9CWar for the Womens\xE2\x80\x9D

Owing to the frailties of poor human nature, it often happens that even
the most docile of husbands when disciplined, justifiably, of course,
by their life partners, will seem to resent it. This is no doubt due to
a yet remaining trace of that philosophy of the stone age which made
the husband regard his wife as being subject to correction by himself.
Of course with most enlightened husbands this quality, if it exists, is
merely atavistic.

\xE2\x80\x9CPete\xE2\x80\x9D was pretty well Americanized, but under stress of a little
excitement was apt to have relapses of his early struggles with his
verbs, singulars and plurals, etc. He was an estimable citizen in
many ways and fully appreciated by his wife, a buxom lady who could,
however, show a terrorizing sense of indignation on occasions when
\xE2\x80\x9CPete\xE2\x80\x9D had lingered too long with the bottle.

One of these interviews had just occurred and his wife\xE2\x80\x99s disapproval
had reached a new high record. A neighbor happened along just as the
lecture was finished and \xE2\x80\x9CPete\xE2\x80\x9D ambling somewhat uncertainly and
disgustedly toward his barn was heard muttering to himself:

\xE2\x80\x9COught to be a war for the womens; too many womens; kill off some of
the womens.\xE2\x80\x9D

But Pete was always glad to accept the olive branch and with his own
natural good sense and the loyal regard and good judgment of his wife
as factors, domestic felicity was always restored as soon as the
sobering up process was ended.

Thus it appears that conjugal life, often looked upon with great
skepticism by certain unmarried people, too cautious for their own
good, as being monotonous in the extreme, is very frequently much
the reverse; also that, generally speaking, husbands, especially of
advanced age, will agree that they have deserved most of the wifely
discipline they have experienced in their married lives, although
they may, especially if in a certain part of New England, quote to
prospective husbands, from the old time song:

    \xE2\x80\x9CAh! young man, how little you know,
      What trials do from wedlock flow.
    You have a few days and nights of ease,
      And then you\xE2\x80\x99ve a scolding wife to please.\xE2\x80\x9D




CHAPTER III

LEGENDS OF THE ECCENTRIC


The unusual mental twist which frequently escapes notice in the crowded
city, is often the center of interest in a rural neighborhood. Those
who thus excite morbid curiosity in their youth are indeed unfortunate
and often suffer keenly from the semi-ostracism which sometimes
follows. But the elderly who have developed unusual characteristics
seem on the contrary to rather pride themselves upon their
peculiarities, holding the view of the ancient Quaker who is reported
to have said one day to his wife: \xE2\x80\x9CEveryone is queer but me and thee;
and thee is some queer.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

Of the various minor misfortunes to which the elderly are subject,
perhaps deafness is the most to be dreaded. This is illustrated in the
case of the elderly country merchant.


\xE2\x80\x9CYou Don\xE2\x80\x99t Have to Yell at Me\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. H-- was the prosperous owner of a general store and had about
everything he needed except normal hearing. He was deaf, unmistakably
deaf, but with the pathetic obstinacy of some thus afflicted, he would
not admit it.

Late one afternoon a well-known citizen called at the store on an
errand for his wife. Others were waiting as the following transaction
was pulled off, and not strange to say, seemed to find it rather
amusing.

\xE2\x80\x9CI want a half pound of cream tartar.\xE2\x80\x9D

The storekeeper seemed unusually impressed.

\xE2\x80\x9CFreem Parker,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s happened to him?\xE2\x80\x9D

Freeman Parker was a well known and popular citizen of the vicinity.

\xE2\x80\x9CA half pound of cream tartar, I said,\xE2\x80\x9D the customer replied, raising
his voice.

\xE2\x80\x9CFreem Parker is dead,\xE2\x80\x9D said the merchant.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, when did it happen?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI want a half pound of CREAM TARTAR,\xE2\x80\x9D was the reply in a very loud
voice.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! you want cream tartar, do you,\xE2\x80\x9D said the dealer in icy tones.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou don\xE2\x80\x99t need to yell at me. I\xE2\x80\x99m not deaf.\xE2\x80\x9D

As before suggested, it is good policy in a rural district to cultivate
reasonably cordial relations with one\xE2\x80\x99s neighbors. Therefore it was
probably poor tactics for a certain exasperated farmer to set a bear
trap in his corn crib. To be sure, he was eminently successful, finding
an exceedingly undesirable citizen the next morning securely fastened
by one hand in the savage jaws of the trap. But it may be taken for
granted that the farmer, who released the man at once, must have felt
easier when the man left the neighborhood which it is hoped he soon
did. Another farm owner was much more diplomatic.


The Story of the Stolen Bundle of Hay

In this instance there was an exhibition of forbearance and strategy
much to be admired.

Finding the barn door open one morning in the late winter, the farmer
was at a loss to understand how the fastenings became loosened. Further
inspection showed that hay had been thrown down from the loft. Still
further examination revealed signs that hay had been carried away,
presumably in a bundle on somebody\xE2\x80\x99s shoulders.

A couple of mornings later there was further evidence of the same petty
thieving. The farmer decided to watch and see what happened. As it was
fairly comfortable sleeping on the hay rolled up in a blanket, the
adventure assumed a considerable degree of entertainment.

About midnight the farmer was aroused by someone carefully opening the
barn door. It was too dark to identify the intruder and in fact the
farmer did not want to know who of his nearby acquaintances could stoop
to anything so contemptible.

The thief had a long rope which in the dim light he laid upon the floor
of the barn. He next piled on as much hay as he could well carry on his
shoulders, and tying it up with the rope, he hastened away.

The farmer watched the man crossing the field. Suddenly an idea came
to him; he did not want to have trouble with a neighbor and he did not
want to lose any more hay. Following at a little distance behind the
thief, his footsteps naturally unheard because of the rustle of the
hay, the farmer struck a match and held it up to the bundle for an
instant and then dodged behind a tree. A moment later the hay burst
into flames. The thief dropped his rope and, screaming with terror,
rushed from sight. It was evident that he regarded the fire as of
supernatural origin. The farmer lost no more hay.

       *       *       *       *       *

Another farmer met a similar problem in a rather different manner. He
was not overburdened with tender solicitude for ne\xE2\x80\x99er-do-wells, as the
following record will show.


The Raid on Jim Green\xE2\x80\x99s Pork Barrel

Jim Green was the sort of agriculturalist who worked hard by day and
slept hard by night. It therefore required several successive attempts
one very early morning before his more wakeful wife succeeded in
arousing him.

\xE2\x80\x9CWake up! wake up!\xE2\x80\x9D said she, in a loud whisper, meanwhile nudging her
sleeping husband vigorously.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy--why, what\xE2\x80\x99s the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D said Jim.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s somebody in the cellar,\xE2\x80\x9D she whispered, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve been hearing
strange noises for several minutes.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jim was now wide awake and hastily slipping on a few clothes, he made
his way to a window and in the dim light soon made out the figure
of a man crouched down by the cellar window, evidently working with
a partner. Further strain of the eyes revealed a pile of what Jim\xE2\x80\x99s
experienced vision showed him to be salt pork, lying on the ground at
the man\xE2\x80\x99s elbow. Jim tiptoed to a side door, opened it quietly and made
his way as silently as possible to where the man was kneeling. But
the slight rustle of his clothing or the jar of his footsteps alarmed
the watcher at the window and, glancing over his shoulder, he hastily
dodged around the corner of the wood shed.

Jim promptly took the missing man\xE2\x80\x99s place by the cellar window and
awaited developments. Shortly thereafter a man in the cellar came to
the window by which Jim was crouching and passed out several pieces of
very damp salt pork which Jim received silently.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve got all there is in the barrel,\xE2\x80\x9D he whispered, \xE2\x80\x9Cexcept the
last layer. Probably we better leave that so the folks here won\xE2\x80\x99t be
entirely out of pork.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D Jim whispered, \xE2\x80\x9Cpull it all out; what do we care whether they
have any pork or not?\xE2\x80\x9D

The man in the cellar went back and, plunging his arm deep in the
clammy brine, succeeded in digging up the last layer of pork which
he brought to the window, passing it up to the owner outside. He
then climbed out of the cellar window himself, where he was promptly
collared by Jim and identified as a shiftless farm laborer of the
neighborhood. He was soon released, however, after he had revealed the
name of his partner, another bird of similar feather.

Not until long after the two prowlers had removed from the
neighborhood, did Jim tell the story. Neighbors then remembered that
when Jim Green needed farm help, the two pork thieves always responded
promptly.

Comparatively few city born people realize how important a factor
the weather is in the daily routine of the farmer. They know that a
long-continued drought causes short crops and that floods sometimes do
considerable damage in certain valleys. Of the inconvenience caused
by unwelcome showers which sometimes become epidemic in busy seasons,
they have no knowledge. In a certain thriving farming section, there
had been a series of sudden thunder showers which had been very
discouraging to hay makers.


How Lote Platt Beat the Thunder Shower

\xE2\x80\x9CLote\xE2\x80\x9D Platt had grown somewhat irascible in his old age and weather
eccentricities had gradually become a personal matter with him. When
unceremonious thunder showers had soaked a certain crop of clover hay
about the third or fourth time, Lote began to feel peevish. However, he
spread the hay out to dry and after one wet surface had responded to
the sun\xE2\x80\x99s rays, he turned the other side up and early in the afternoon
found the clover in prime order to go in the barn.

He hastened to rake it into long windrows and was just preparing to
send his hired man after the oxen and cart when he heard the grumbling
of thunder and felt the coolness of the rain breeze. Another shower was
coming!

The hired man started on the run to get the oxen, but Lote soon
realized that the shower, and apparently a very wet one too, was going
to reach the hay field long before the oxen could be gotten there.

\xE2\x80\x9CBoo-boo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lote, as an unusually loud peal of thunder made the air
vibrate. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll show you something you never thought of.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lote was at the extreme windward side of the field and the long
rows of freshly raked hay stretched out before the strong breeze,
the forerunner of the approaching storm. Dropping on one knee, Lote
scratched a match, shielded it a moment with his old straw hat and then
held the blaze to the end of the windrow. Fanned by the wind, the fire
followed the long row of dry hay across the field. Then another blaze
followed by others also, and when the shower arrived, the clover which
had cost so much labor to be fitted for the hay mow, had ceased to be a
problem.

       *       *       *       *       *

When the proverbially amiable citizen bursts forth in rage, it is
astonishing to those who look on, and apt to be quite disconcerting to
a perfectly innocent victim. It certainly was to the lumberjack who was
\xE2\x80\x9Cbawled out\xE2\x80\x9D by Uncle Jimmy Ryan.


The Tale of the Old-Fashioned \xE2\x80\x9CSettle\xE2\x80\x9D

A logging enterprise was under way back along the edge of the mountain
and Uncle Jimmy\xE2\x80\x99s wife was induced by the boss to board some of the
help. A newcomer had joined the gang and was informed at quitting time
that arrangements had been made for him to join the others at Uncle
Jimmy\xE2\x80\x99s.

The new recruit made his way with a half dozen other husky workers to
the little low roofed farm house and going into the combined kitchen,
dining and living room, dropped his bag in a corner, tossing his
overcoat on one end of what seemed to be a large chest along the wall
back of the cooking range.

Uncle Jimmy, a short and roly-poly man of sixty-five or so, was moving
blandly about, speaking to one and then another of the \xE2\x80\x9Cguests,\xE2\x80\x9D
when suddenly his eye fell on the overcoat, hanging over one end of
the chest. Rushing forward, he caught the coat and turning to the
astonished man who owned it, proceeded to express great indignation,
although in his excitement he had lapsed into the Irish brogue of his
early days so that what he said was unintelligible.

Finally the wife who had kept serene during her husband\xE2\x80\x99s tirade, made
the matter clear.

The \xE2\x80\x9Cchest\xE2\x80\x9D was an old-fashioned \xE2\x80\x9Csettle\xE2\x80\x9D with an adjustable back. It
contained a mattress and at about five o\xE2\x80\x99clock every day Uncle Jimmy\xE2\x80\x99s
mother of ninety or more went to bed in the settle, the wooden back of
which was shut down, closing tightly. A circular opening in the end,
near the old lady\xE2\x80\x99s face, provided air circulation.

The lumberman had unknowingly closed the opening. The offender
apologized and harmony was restored.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is no place like the farm for those unfortunates whose ability
to perform crude manual labor is their chief asset. The farmer who
must exercise a never failing forbearance in the management of horses
and cattle often extends his sympathetic supervision over the mentally
defective ones who can be utilized in providing the necessary hand
labor. Thus it came about that one of those grown up children had found
a comfortable home at Mr. Hubbard\xE2\x80\x99s.


The Lost Harrow Teeth

Thomas was socially inclined and the boys of the community were too
kindly disposed to exclude him from their company.

The owner of a nearby farm had been \xE2\x80\x9Cseeding down\xE2\x80\x9D a stumpy addition
to his pasture, and early in the summer some boys, including Thomas,
wandered in that direction one Sunday afternoon, discovering a small
wooden harrow with iron \xE2\x80\x9Cteeth,\xE2\x80\x9D which had been left on the field until
a more convenient season. The shrinking of the wood in the summer sun
had loosened these teeth and a few of them had dropped out. Thus it
came about that the boys were afflicted with a wonderfully funny idea.

A few mornings later Mr. Perry, the owner of the harrow and
incidentally of several farms in the neighborhood, had occasion to
drive up to Mr. Hubbard\xE2\x80\x99s place on business. It was but a short
distance and he could easily have walked, but for the fact that he was
very lame.

Mr. Hubbard was at home, and receiving his visitor very cordially, they
entered into an earnest conversation. The child of misfortune, Thomas,
came around the corner of an outbuilding and seeing the two men so
busily occupied, stopped at once. He seemed to be much agitated.

The conversation continued, the two neighbors, however, subconsciously
watching the boy. Suddenly he rushed forward.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou old lame cuss!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, addressing the astonished visitor.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou old lame cuss! I don\xE2\x80\x99t know anything about your harrow teeth.\xE2\x80\x9D He
then dodged back out of sight.

The two men looked at each other in amazement.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you suppose he means?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Perry.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D was the reply, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I intend to find out.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHere, you, Thomas!\xE2\x80\x9D he called, \xE2\x80\x9Ccome back here.\xE2\x80\x9D

The boy came reluctantly forward, and after some questioning revealed
that the boys in their holiday spirit of mischief had concealed the
loose harrow teeth in a hollow stump near where the harrow lay as a
joke on the Perry boys--a trifling matter in itself but which had
assumed great and terrifying importance to poor unfortunate Thomas.

       *       *       *       *       *

To speak of the childish wrath of the aged is misleading in its
suggestiveness. More properly we should refer to the childish wrath of
the old man; for it is an undeniable fact that elderly women exhibit
much greater patience with the inevitable annoyances of life than old
men do.

A popular cartoonist has frequently exhibited these sudden tactics
of impotent wrath in a very amusing way. But his imagination never
has suggested anything more violent in its explosiveness than Uncle
Reuben\xE2\x80\x99s rage at a balky \xE2\x80\x9Csalt shake.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Story of the Salt Shake

Uncle Reuben and his more amiable wife were visiting with relatives.
His hostess was one of the New England type who never could do enough
for her guests.

Uncle Reuben who was quite advanced in years and whose habitual
irritability had proportionally increased, was feeling unusually
peevish this morning. It was midsummer and exceedingly warm and humid.

The contents of the glass salt shake allotted to this peevish old
gentleman had become, like everything else, affected by the prevailing
humidity. The most vigorous shaking failed to produce any results.
After repeated attempts, Uncle Reuben paused and quietly examined
the salt shake which he held in his hand. His amiable wife, knowing
his characteristics, looked anxious. His kindly hostess, also well
acquainted with the aforesaid characteristics, looked deeply concerned.

Finally Uncle Reuben spoke in those tones of forced calmness which are
usually associated with some great crisis.

\xE2\x80\x9CPauline,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI wish to buy this salt shake.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t sell it,\xE2\x80\x9D replied his hostess, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou may have it, and
welcome.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I want to buy it!\xE2\x80\x9D said Uncle Reuben in dramatic tones.

\xE2\x80\x9CI want to buy it. I want to take it out to the stone pile and grind it
to powder.\xE2\x80\x9D


\xE2\x80\x9CBetter Give Them to Some Poor Boy\xE2\x80\x9D

Just because a man has to be supported as a public charge by the town
he lives in, is no reason why he should not have some definite ideas
about correct dress.

\xE2\x80\x9CUncle Timmy\xE2\x80\x9D may have seen better days, but it was so far back in
his history that no one remembered anything about it. He was supplied
with board in a private family at the town\xE2\x80\x99s expense, the poor master
incidentally providing two other urgent necessities, _viz._, wearing
apparel and chewing tobacco, the latter being purchased in quantity and
\xE2\x80\x9Cdoled out\xE2\x80\x9D to Uncle Timmy little at a time, as otherwise the expense
of this luxury would have reached a very large item in the course of a
year.

About once in so often Uncle Timmy would happen around to see the poor
master to talk things over. He was very sociable indeed and would go
into all the details as to the menu at his boarding place, which was
very seldom satisfactory.

One day Uncle Timmy appeared, and after he had given a report of how he
was enjoying his present boarding place, it occurred to the poor master
that a certain pair of misfit shoes, which were of no special value to
anyone, might be utilized by this long-time guest of the community. So
he brought out the shoes and suggested that Uncle Timmy take them home
with him.

The old man turned the shoes over and over and examined them carefully.
When it was suggested that he try them on, as apparently they would fit
him, he shook his head.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CI guess I won\xE2\x80\x99t take them. You better give them to some
poor boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

There is no doubt that Uncle Timmy was naturally an aristocrat.




CHAPTER IV

FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS AND SMALL TOWN LIFE


Those sections of rural New England which have possessed natural
advantages sufficient to restrain the young people from their common
propensity to emigrate to the cities or to the western states, are rich
in family legends which show that frequent persistence of family traits
which is exceptionally pronounced in the six little states of the
northeast.

       *       *       *       *       *

A well-known family had occupied a prominent position in a certain New
England town for several generations. During all this period certain
pronounced characteristics had afforded amusement to the people of the
community, especially those of the father and daughter whose mental
processes are illustrated by the following narratives.


The Young Man Who Had \xE2\x80\x9CSpeerit\xE2\x80\x9D

The father had reached quite an advanced age, and although very
amiable, had become exceedingly economical. There were people who
would have said he was stingy--a common enough accusation against the
aged. Besides his commodious house in town, he had a small farm and
every spring he looked about and engaged some young man to undertake
the double r\xC3\xB4le of handy man around the house and farm laborer. The boy
who took that job could be always sure of steady occupation; he was
expected to rise early and work late.

One spring the old gentleman succeeded in securing a perfect treasure.
A boy of eighteen years or thereabouts was engaged from a distant farm
and came to town prepared to enjoy, what was to him, metropolitan
life. A naturally willing worker, he soon found that there was little
opportunity for recreation, at least during the daylight hours. In time
he gradually made acquaintances who soon confirmed his own opinion
that he was being imposed upon. He was still in awe of his employer,
however, but finally an occasion developed when he could restrain
himself no longer. On a very hot evening, after a hard day on the
farm, he was directed to go into the wood shed and saw up some very
dry fire wood of various uneven lengths. This was too much, and with
a fluency which absolutely astonished both himself and listener, he
proceeded to tell his employer just what he thought of his stinginess.
For several minutes the old man stood perfectly amazed, the boy
meantime hastening to his room, where he put on his best clothes and
went up town. He naturally expected to be discharged, but such was
not the case. After thinking the matter over a few minutes, the old
man began to chuckle to himself, after which he shuffled off up the
street, telling one citizen after another of his recent extraordinary
experience.

\xE2\x80\x9CI like that boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CHe has speerit.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Lady Who Secured a Wardrobe

This old gentleman had a wife who was in delicate health and a
middle-aged daughter who was not delicate. She was a very capable
housekeeper and as a rule not socially inclined. She stayed at home
month after month, year after year and finally her married sister and
sister-in-law, neither of whom were reluctant to point out the path
of duty to their amiable parent, insisted that it was only right that
\xE2\x80\x9CSally\xE2\x80\x9D should have a vacation. They pictured out the need of change
of scene, incidentally laying particular stress upon the even greater
need of a replenished wardrobe. The old gentleman was very reluctant
to yield to their persuasions, especially in the matter of the
appropriation for clothes. It gave him a pang to pass over the money
necessary for the outfit, but under such effective concurrent pressure,
the outcome can easily be imagined. He finally resigned himself to the
inevitable, wrote a handsome check and costumers were put to work.

While these numerous family discussions were going on, \xE2\x80\x9CSally\xE2\x80\x9D had
seemed to show but a languid interest. This was attributed by her
sisters to the fact that she had stayed at home so long that she didn\xE2\x80\x99t
want to go anywhere else. In the light of subsequent events it would
appear that their diagnosis was correct.

After the first pangs of separation from the cash, the father began to
take an extraordinary interest in the outfitting process. He passed his
judgment on the different fabrics, the styles into which they were to
be made up and seemed to be looking forward with anticipation to the
time when \xE2\x80\x9CSally\xE2\x80\x9D would start out on her vacation trip with a wardrobe
equal to that of any woman who had left that town in a long time.

Finally the outfit of new dresses, coats, hats, and other essential
articles was complete and the day was set when the vacation should
begin.

According to the plans, Sally was to go to New York to meet a family
friend, visiting other points of interest as her impulses might
suggest. The day of departure arrived, and Sally\xE2\x80\x99s father was alive
to the situation. A maid had been secured for a certain limited
engagement and she was called early and told to prepare breakfast.
The old man knocked vigorously on Sally\xE2\x80\x99s door to make sure that she
didn\xE2\x80\x99t oversleep. Breakfast was ready and Sally did not appear. Her
father began to be anxious lest she miss the train. He sent the maid
up to knock at the door, who returned saying that Sally had answered,
\xE2\x80\x9CAll right.\xE2\x80\x9D Still she did not appear and it began to be certain that
if she went that day she would have to go on a later train. Her father
was indignant at her unwarranted indolence. He went up stairs and
pounded once more on Sally\xE2\x80\x99s door, which she opened, clad in her usual
kitchen apparel. The old man demanded an explanation which was promptly
forthcoming.

\xE2\x80\x9CI didn\xE2\x80\x99t have the slightest intention of going to New York any of the
time, but I knew that the only way I could ever get you to furnish me
with any decent clothes, was to pretend I was going. Now I have the
clothes and I am glad to have them, and I am going to stay at home and
you can pay up that maid and let her go about her business.\xE2\x80\x9D

It must be regretfully stated that no record has been preserved of what
Sally\xE2\x80\x99s feminine relatives had to say to her.

In certain social circles astonishing heraldic pedigrees make their
appearance, heretofore all unsuspected by the average list of
acquaintances, but there can be no camouflage about family pedigrees
in a strictly rural neighborhood. An eminent financier in a New
England town had a relative who did not add any prestige to the family
escutcheon. Having little inclination to work and a very moderate
earning power even when he did work, a small annuity which he received
was greatly appreciated by this scion of a lofty family. For a short
time after his quarterly allowance arrived, \xE2\x80\x9CLafe\xE2\x80\x9D lived in luxury.


The Story of \xE2\x80\x9CLafe\xE2\x80\x9D and the Livery Stable Man

A widely known hotel man of the community had as a side interest, a
small but well equipped livery stable, which in the days before the
automobile, was a handy source of income. On a certain sultry summer
day who should ramble into the livery stable but Lafe. The owner
happened to be at the office and Lafe negotiated with him for the use
of a horse and buggy, for a couple of hours. Knowing his man, the
proprietor suggested that he had better pay in advance, as he himself
might not be there when Lafe returned. This was but an agreeable detail
to the man who was just then in funds and he passed out the money
without any hesitation whatever, after which he took his seat in the
buggy which had been run out of the barn preparatory to harnessing the
horse to it.

As stated before, it was sultry and Lafe was not only oppressed by
the heat, but also by several drinks he had enjoyed shortly before.
He fell asleep. Therefore, when the horse was led out, it was decided
that he better be led back into the barn again for a time and await
developments. Lafe slumbered on, finally arousing himself just about
the time when the two hours were up that he had contracted for. The
livery stable man was not a trickster, but he greatly enjoyed a joke.
He informed Lafe that he had had his ride so far as he was concerned,
having occupied the buggy and having been in a position to use the
horse, if he so desired. Lafe saw the joke, and being a good loser he
promptly went away with a broad grin on his face, resolving to \xE2\x80\x9Cget
even.\xE2\x80\x9D The livery stable man industriously spread the story which came
to Lafe\xE2\x80\x99s ears quite frequently.

Some months afterwards the stable owner happened to be about sixty
miles away taking a train for home and behold there was Lafe, also
taking the train. The memory of that unenjoyed but paid for ride was
still lingering in Lafe\xE2\x80\x99s mind, so he asked the practical joker if he
would not advance the money to pay his railroad fare.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy should you pay any railroad fares, when your cousin is a big owner
in the railroad?\xE2\x80\x9D was the reply. \xE2\x80\x9CYou just tell the conductor who you
are and he will pass you without any ticket.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you back me up, if I do tell him?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Lafe.

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly,\xE2\x80\x9D was the answer. \xE2\x80\x9CThat will be all right.\xE2\x80\x9D

[Illustration: A SHADY DRIVE \xE2\x80\x9CDOWN EAST\xE2\x80\x9D]

Whereupon Lafe took his seat in the front end of the day coach, the
livery stable man being seated with a friend in the back part of the
same car. Enter the conductor. He approached Lafe, demanding a ticket.
Then followed a brief but animated conversation as a result of which
Lafe turned and made a signal to the man in the rear of the car, who
promptly nodded his head. The conductor therefore proceeded about his
duties, collecting fares from various passengers, until he approached
the livery man, who, stating his destination, handed him a mileage
book. The conductor took the book and promptly detached two fares
instead of one. When the owner of the mileage book asked the reason, he
was informed by the conductor that he had been told by the man down in
front that he would get his fare at the other end of the car and that
he had confirmed the arrangement.

It may be taken for granted that among the habitues of the hotel and
livery stable, the foregoing transactions were fully appreciated. Lafe
was temporarily a hero, and no one enjoyed the joke better than the
livery man did.

While it was regarded absolutely essential in small town life to be
able, in New England phrase, to \xE2\x80\x9Ctake a joke,\xE2\x80\x9D there was of course a
reasonable limit. A joke ceases to be a joke when there is any evidence
of ill nature or maliciousness back of it. Just where the dividing line
comes in of course varies with the circumstances.

In a certain rural town there was a young man whose tendency to
slow wit was counter-balanced by a very amiable disposition. It is
not surprising therefore that there should have been those who were
inclined to take advantage and subject him to ridicule. This was less
annoying to the victim of these jokes than to some of his friends.


The Man Who Wanted to Fight a Year Afterward

One election day, in early September, the amiable young man in
question, after depositing his ballot and going down the stairs from
the hall where the election was held, was intercepted by some local
clown who, taking him entirely off his guard, kicked him down the last
few steps of the stairway to the floor below, where he landed in a
very undignified attitude. With unruffled amiability the victim of
horse play scrambled to his feet, brushed the dust from his clothes,
and joined heartily in the empty laughter of the onlookers.

His close friends had not happened to witness this episode, but heard
of it before leaving the hall. On their way home they expressed
themselves very indignantly and asked the amiable victim why he
submitted to such abuse, assuring him that he could easily make short
work of the other man and there was no reason why he should put up with
any such treatment. This put the matter in an entirely new light to the
man who had shown such remarkable good nature a short time before. He
thought deeply and said nothing.

The year rolled around and another September found the same assemblage
at the town hall for the election. Everyone had forgotten the stairway
incident of the year before, with one exception, and that was the
victim. To the absolute amazement of all present, he hunted up his
astonished antagonist of the year before and it required the combined
efforts of all the young man\xE2\x80\x99s friends to keep him from committing
serious assault on the joker. He was restrained with some difficulty
and taken to one side of the hall where his friends proceeded to
explain to him that his grievance was now outlawed.

The trademark has become no small factor in modern business. Its
imitation by rival firms is not only frowned upon as a breach of
ethics, but in most civilized or even semi-civilized countries, it is
illegal.


A Rural \xE2\x80\x9CTrademark\xE2\x80\x9D

There was one such violation, however, many years ago in a small town,
none of whose inhabitants perhaps had ever before heard of such a thing
as a \xE2\x80\x9Ctrademark\xE2\x80\x9D in its modern meaning.

One of the chief sources of income to farmers in that section was
butter-making. At that time all butter was put down in wooden tubs,
which were mostly hand made. An old growth spruce tree of good size and
of a certain grain would be sawed into right lengths. These would be
split with great care into staves. These in turn would be shaved down
as smoothly as possible, enclosed in ash hoops and fitted out with a
cover, the rim of which was likewise an ash hoop.

An old man who had become quite skillful in manufacturing these butter
packages, finally acquired such pride in his work that upon finishing
each tub he would take a soft lead pencil and write his initials in
large flourishing characters. As he was practically illiterate, his
monogram was all the more amusing to others.

These packages were not only supplied to certain farmers, but were
furnished to a nearby country store to be carried in stock. There were
other builders of hand-made butter tubs who were not so careful about
the finish of their articles.

One evening this creator of artistic butter tubs meandered to the
village store. A waggish individual who saw him there and enjoyed his
self-satisfied and expansive manner in the store, had one of those
bright ideas which so frequently afflict humanity. In the back room
of the store there were some butter packages manufactured by a rival
of the artist before mentioned. These tubs were a little more uncouth
in their getup than usual. The maker of this brand of packages had the
excellent taste not to identify himself with his completed product by
any monogram. Selecting one of the roughest looking of these packages,
the joker borrowed a pencil and soon produced a crude imitation of
the well known initials. He then walked into the inner store, handed
the butter tub to the rival manufacturer and asked him how he ever
had the face to put out such coarse looking work as that. The artist
indignantly denying any responsibility for the tub, or even knowledge
thereof, his attention was immediately called to the trademark on the
bottom.

This was the last straw and the creator of masterpieces in the
butter-tub making art, nearly produced a riot. He accused the
storekeeper of connivance and a gross fraud on the community and
threatened dire proceedings in other directions. The disgusted
proprietor of the store finally succeeded in explaining the matter.
The perpetrator of the joke slipped out of the store by the back way
and eventually the rumblings of wrath and outraged culture subsided.

       *       *       *       *       *

It has been before stated that the satisfaction of living on fairly
amicable terms with one\xE2\x80\x99s neighbors in a farming region tends to
develop not only much forbearance but diplomacy as well. This was
illustrated in a certain case where the bone of contention was a line
fence.


An Early Example of Camouflage

A certain man who lived on a small farm had a perfect mania for
lawsuits. This was not so uncommon in earlier days, as it was rather
in the line of policy of certain pettifogging lawyers to encourage
litigation.

Between his farm and the adjoining one there was a division fence
which seemed to be always falling to pieces. The man who lived on this
adjoining farm suspected that the cattle were not altogether to blame
for the frequent breaches in the fence. The cattle continued to come
over onto his land and he finally decided to devote one whole day, if
necessary, to watchful waiting. He therefore established himself in a
clump of bushes where he had a pretty good view of quite a stretch of
the fence, and not very long afterwards he saw the half grown son of
the belligerent neighbor approach the division line and loosen some of
the rails to such an extent that it would be an easy matter for the
cattle to get across.

The man on guard was puzzled for a moment just what to do, but realized
the importance of avoiding hostilities with his neighbor, if it were
possible. Finally he had an inspiration.

The boy who had done the mischief was well known in the neighborhood as
somewhat defective mentally. Hastily removing his old coat, which had a
very dilapidated lining, the resourceful observer turned it inside out
and again put it on, dragging his old felt hat down over his eyes. Next
he rubbed a handful of black dirt over his face, after which with blood
curdling yells, he started down the hills toward the boy. One glimpse
was enough for the youngster who fled to the house panic stricken.
A little later on the diplomatist, resuming his normal appearance,
apparently happened along in a leisurely way, repaired the fence and
went home.

By a perhaps not unexplainable coincidence, the cattle remained on
their own side of the fence thereafter.


\xE2\x80\x9CNoah Built the Ark\xE2\x80\x9D

In another locality there were four brothers whose personal traits
were so markedly individual as to make the family stand out somewhat
prominently in the community. All these amiable peculiarities were of
course thoroughly understood by the local inhabitants. First one of the
brothers and then another would figure in some transaction in a way to
bring out the same family characteristic.

The oldest one of the four brothers bore the biblical name of Noah, and
was a carpenter. Another brother often assisted him at the same trade.
Still another brother was a farmer, while the fourth had no settled
occupation.

These amusing details of the various activities of these brothers
finally inspired a local humorist to sum up the doings of the four in
the following luminous example of rural verse:

    \xE2\x80\x9CNoah built the Ark,
      Seth laid the floor,
    Jim drove the geese in,
      And Tom shut the door.\xE2\x80\x9D




CHAPTER V

THE YANKEE TRADING INSTINCT AND SOME AMUSING EXAMPLES


In the ordinary processes of trade the Yankee is a firm believer in
the old Roman Law of \xE2\x80\x9C_caveat emptor_\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Clet the buyer beware.\xE2\x80\x9D
While there may be occasional instances of neighborhood disapproval
where this principle has been worked out to the discomfiture of the
too confiding, in general it is held in respect as the only basis for
sound business. That there can be a new dispensation whereby business
can be carried on safely on the basis of a tender altruistic regard
for the financial safeguarding of those who lack the ability to think
for themselves, and thus produce that utopia which certain enthusiasts
would seem to regard as possible, has yet to be demonstrated.


The Story of the Eccentric Cow

There was a man who wished to buy a cow. There was another man who
had cows to sell. When the prospective buyer, known locally as \xE2\x80\x9CEd,\xE2\x80\x9D
looked over the herd of the seller, his eye rested upon a certain cow
which the latter was especially anxious to dispose of. He had indicated
what he would take for several other cows, but had carefully refrained
from making any reference to the particular cow. Noting this omission,
the buyer gave the animal in question very special attention and asked
the price. He was told that this cow was not for sale as she belonged
to \xE2\x80\x9CHannah,\xE2\x80\x9D his wife. Ed immediately became convinced that Hannah\xE2\x80\x99s
cow must be a very superior animal and lost all interest in the other
quotations. However, he made very little headway at first, but finally
the owner said he would go in and talk with his wife and see if she
would consent to sell her cow. He went in the house and was gone quite
some time, but finally appeared and said that his wife had consented
to let the cow go, although it was apparent from his tone that she was
very reluctant to part with it. The trade was soon made and Ed drove
the cow home in triumph.

Shortly after the animal was established in her new home it was time to
do the milking, and the proud owner proceeded to begin the operation.
He soon found that the cow was quite reluctant to be milked and when
she had kicked the milk pail across the stable two or three times, he
called on his hired man for help. Together they attempted to mollify
the fractious animal but the results were far from satisfactory.

The next morning the same comedy was enacted and Ed became quite
pessimistic. He decided that it was sort of a mean trick for a neighbor
to wheedle a woman into giving up her favorite cow and he drove to the
farm of the original owner and told him so. He carefully refrained from
making any reference to the eccentricities shown by the cow, believing
that by a master stroke of diplomacy in showing such consideration
for the other man\xE2\x80\x99s wife, he might negotiate an exchange. The former
owner listened to his remarks and again said that he would talk the
matter over with his wife. Ed waited anxiously for the result. After an
interval of ten or fifteen minutes the devoted husband once more made
his appearance and informed Ed that Hannah had \xE2\x80\x9Cgot over feeling bad\xE2\x80\x9D
and decided she would not be selfish in the matter.

The new owner of the temperamental cow greatly regretted his haste in
concluding the bargain before he had inquired more definitely as to the
cow\xE2\x80\x99s disposition. But, realizing that a trade was a trade, he made the
best of the matter and no doubt derived enough amusement by telling the
incident to his numerous acquaintances to offset his financial loss.
Had he asked the original owner the plain question if the cow objected
to being milked, he would have been told the facts without doubt. But,
noticing his eagerness to buy, irrespective of all ordinary rules of
prudence, the original owner could not resist the temptation to drive a
hard bargain.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the earlier days of agriculture in New England, no farm of any size
was regarded as properly equipped without a stalwart yoke of oxen,
which were best adapted to the rough stumpy fields and relatively
uneven highways. Although money was scarce, time was in adequate
supply. There followed the necessity of that great empire building
vehicle, the ox-cart.


The Remarkable Incident of the Cart Wheels

There was a well-known resident of a certain rural community commonly
referred to as \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Reuben.\xE2\x80\x9D Being a natural mechanic, he acquired
an enviable reputation as a wheel-wright who could turn out better
cart-wheels than anyone in that region.

All the average farmer needed was the two wheels, which were built
exactly alike; he could do the rest of the work himself in his spare
time, the pole or \xE2\x80\x9Cneap,\xE2\x80\x9D as it was locally designated, being a simple
affair, as also was the cart body.

To this master builder of cart-wheels there came one day a farmer from
a remote mountain side and bargained for a pair which were to be paid
for at some future time in farm products. The wheels were to be ready
for delivery on the following Saturday week.

Uncle Reuben proceeded leisurely about his task, as work was rather
slack, but completed his job on the Friday preceding the promised date
and turned out a rather better job than usual. That very afternoon a
well-to-do farmer from a nearby valley drove up to engage a pair of
cart-wheels and as soon as he entered the shop, his eyes fell upon
those just completed. They were exactly what he wanted and he insisted
upon having them. Uncle Reuben told him the wheels were already sold
and who was to have them. The man of affluence was urgent. Uncle
Reuben could make the mountain farmer another pair and as a clinching
argument proposed to pay cash for the wheels. Uncle Reuben hesitated
but the temptation of ready cash payment instead of merchandise was too
much. He accepted the offer, the money was paid and that evening the
purchaser sent his man for the wheels.

All the next day Uncle Reuben worked feverishly on another pair of
cart-wheels for the original purchaser. As he worked he formulated the
excuse he must offer to allay the other man\xE2\x80\x99s disappointment. Along in
the afternoon the mountaineer appeared to get his wheels. He did not
get the wheels of course, but he carried away a most unique excuse.

In his blandest manner Uncle Reuben explained the matter very clearly.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know,\xE2\x80\x9D says he, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t see how in the world I could have done
it, but when I had got the wheels all finished I found I had gone and
built two right-hand wheels. A man came along who thought he could use
them and I let them go.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

There is probably no more effective form of the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cpitiless
publicity\xE2\x80\x9D than that which throws its calcium moral rays upon the
unconventional resident of a rural community in New England. There can
be little that transpires that is not only well known but carefully
weighed in the balances. There is an illuminating legend which tells of
an unwise battle with rural public opinion.


The Thrilling Experiences of a Mountain \xE2\x80\x9CDoctress\xE2\x80\x9D

A woman who with her husband and child had taken up her abode in a
remote district was at first well received. She became interested
in the little church and being of a bland disposition and an alert
mind succeeded in passing the censorship with comparative credit.
Unfortunately for herself and child the husband died and soon there
were rumors that she was not showing a proper sense of bereavement.
The local atmosphere became chilly and she decided that she must do
something to indicate proper devotion to her husband\xE2\x80\x99s memory.

About fifteen miles away, there was a distant cousin of her late
husband who was a dealer in monuments. To him she appeared one day
and mournfully announced her desire to erect a monument to her late
husband. She admitted that she had no money to pay for it, but said she
had a piece of land with a house upon it and that she would willingly
sacrifice that property to ensure the creation of a suitable memorial.
The dealer and incidental relative was very favorably disposed, not
only to the ingratiating widow, but to what apparently was a promising
venture. A trade was soon made, the widow departed and in a short time
the monument was properly erected in the cemetery. Nothing was said at
that time as to a transfer of the real estate, but some weeks later
the dealer being in the town where it was located, decided to take a
look at his new property. He found a small irregular patch of rocks and
bushes with a tumbledown rough board shanty upon it. A few inquiries
soon made it clear that the joke was on him and he never made any move
to secure a title. After a time the humor of the transaction overcame
his disgust at the trick and he told the story on himself, to the great
joy of those better acquainted with the characteristics of the widow.

It must be regretfully chronicled, however, that even the monument
failed to reinstate the lady in the good graces of her feminine
neighbors. She was lonely, very short of cash and possessed of an
inventive mind; naturally there were developments. For years there was
no lack of conversational topics in that community, at least among the
women.

Shortly after the monument episode there appeared an imposing looking
sign on the front of the widow\xE2\x80\x99s residence, containing her name with
the very unusual title, \xE2\x80\x9CDoctress.\xE2\x80\x9D Such medical knowledge as she
possessed was not claimed to be the result of any special study but
rather the evidence of some extraordinary intuition. There were plenty
of similar instances in the days before the practice of medicine was
legally restricted. It soon became apparent that the widow\xE2\x80\x99s patients
were chiefly resident boarders, generally one or two lonely old
widowers. In a vague sense, therefore, it may be seen that the widow
had forecast in her mind the general idea of the sanitarium, then
practically unknown. The hum of gossip reached a high crescendo and
the sanitarium project was soon abandoned--not however, because of the
gossip but for lack of sufficient clinical material to pay expenses.
Thereupon the people of the township began to wonder what would happen
next. They didn\xE2\x80\x99t have long to wait.

Although the possessor of extraordinary gifts in the healing art,
the widow had other talents which were not kept in obscurity. She
\xE2\x80\x9Cdickered\xE2\x80\x9D in real estate in a necessarily small way and was a horse
trader of recognized ability. But her ambition at this time was in the
medical field and having removed to commodious quarters she announced
her great discovery, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Mountain Envigorator.\xE2\x80\x9D

Although this panacea was widely heralded as calculated to relieve most
of the physical ills of mankind, and although Emerson, the Sage, has
pictured in graphic language the great procession of people who would
eagerly penetrate the trackless wilderness to do business with the
inventor of a better mouse trap than the one probably in use at the
Philosopher\xE2\x80\x99s Concord residence, there was singular apathy manifest
regarding the Envigorator. Sales were very, very slow and expenses
large.

However, the widow was resourceful. She fitted out a two-horse pedlar\xE2\x80\x99s
cart and engaged an assistant to travel about with her and help
introduce her remedy.

Thereupon for a season the money began to flow back to the widow\xE2\x80\x99s
purse. But such prosperity was too obvious to the assistant who soon
began to clamor for an exorbitant salary. It was a crisis and must be
met and was met.

At this time the widow\xE2\x80\x99s personal charms had become somewhat mellowed
with age, but she decided to exercise them. The young man with a
fortune in sight soon succumbed and they were married.

It will probably occasion no surprise to relate that the husband\xE2\x80\x99s
financial demands soon exceeded his most preposterous claims as an
employee. Dissensions arose, the business languished and the bridegroom
departed. The widow also went away, never to return, but before leaving
she accomplished a master stroke which aroused the admiration of the
most censorious women of the countryside.

In a nearby village there was a woman who had succeeded in making
herself feared for her vindictive type of gossip. She had long
specialized on the widow\xE2\x80\x99s affairs. Not content with revealing what she
knew, she finally surpassed herself with a story which could easily
be shown to be false. The victim saw her opportunity and the romancer
was given her choice of an immediate retraction or jail. A day or two
later the widow and the gossiping dame made the rounds of the village
and adjacent farms. At each call the hostess was informed by the widow
that her companion had an explanation to make. Whereupon the woman of
the poison tongue would proceed to relate that in telling the story
in question, she had drawn wholly upon her imagination. Before the
housewife could recover from her astonishment at such an unprecedented
narrative, the widow and her victim would have departed to convey the
glad tidings elsewhere.

       *       *       *       *       *

While there are few who can surpass the typical New England Yankee as
a natural shrewd trader, there are numerous residents of that section
of Canadian-French, Irish or Italian ancestry, who are amply qualified
to hold their own. A conspicuous example of this type of shrewdness is
recorded in which an Irishman, widely known as \xE2\x80\x9CTim,\xE2\x80\x9D took the leading
part.


The Expedient of the Cow Buyer

\xE2\x80\x9CTim\xE2\x80\x9D had a large farm and always had cows to sell to buyers, provided
he could get his price, which was usually a stiff one. To replace
animals thus disposed of, he would travel around the surrounding
country, securing a cow here and there, as they could be picked up at
his price. A fortunate sale left him very short of dairy cows, and
hearing of a farmer living some distance away, who had some to sell, he
lost no time in appearing on the scene.

The farmer in question had twenty good looking animals, but even Tim,
with all his experience and judgment, could not for the life of him
make up his mind which were the most desirable for his purpose. As he
saw the farmer did not know who he was, he assumed the guise of the
confiding novice. He asked the farmer to put a price on ten cows, as he
might select from the herd. After some hesitation the seller named a
figure which was a very fair price for good cows but a high price for
most any other kind. Every herd has its star performers and just how
to get the best from the herd was a problem. After much discussion and
innocent talk on his part, Tim finally asked the farmer to recommend
the cows that would be likely to be satisfactory to him, if he was to
accept his offer. This idea seemed to be attractive to the seller,
and he proceeded to point out a cow here and there in the herd until
he had finally named the ten to make up the order. Tim\xE2\x80\x99s decision was
immediate.

\xE2\x80\x9CAll right,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll take the other ten.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was an unexpected turn of affairs to the seller, but he was a man
of his word and Tim drove his ten best cows away with that deep sense
of satisfaction which the skillful trader always experiences when
things have come his way.

       *       *       *       *       *

It may be assumed therefore that the modern form of sentimentalism,
of which we hear so much in certain circles, whereby the energetic
and thrifty are held in disapproval because they do not show a tender
solicitude for the indolent and incapable, is not widely prevalent
in rural New England. Every real Yankee who gets the losing end of
a trade, under fair circumstances, accepts the results of his own
incapacity and resolves to be more cautious in the future. As an
example of this give and take state of public opinion may be mentioned
the case of the man who had contracted with a mechanic for a new milk
sled.


The History of a Milk Sled

The mechanic was well qualified. It could be taken for granted that
a finished article from his hands would be satisfactory. The only
difficulty was in getting him to complete the job. Being occupied with
various details he was inclined to procrastinate. In this instance he
made an excellent start, had the sled well near completion, and then
for some unaccountable reason could not seem to get the time to finish
it. The customer would inquire every day or two as to the prospects.
There was an abundance of promises but very little action. Several
weeks went by. The situation became very exasperating.

The builder of sleds had an excellent article of his own employed in
his collateral enterprises. One day the customer whose old sled was
now in the last stages of dilapidation, saw the mechanic on his way to
town and came to an instant decision. He drove to the latter\xE2\x80\x99s home,
changed his horses to the mechanic\xE2\x80\x99s sled and proceeded about his
business. When he saw the owner he told him he could have his property
back when he had finished the job promised weeks before. The mechanic
grinned appreciatively, and in a very short time the contract was
completed.




CHAPTER VI

DOMESTIC ANIMALS AND THEIR PART IN LEGENDARY HUMOR


One of the strongest potential arguments in favor of the so-called
\xE2\x80\x9Cback to the farm\xE2\x80\x9D movement, is seldom appreciated by city dwellers,
_viz._, the opportunity thus afforded for companionship with the
domestic animals.

To the average person there are horses, cattle, dogs and cats; but
those, especially farm people, who are in intimate daily contact
with these animals, realize that every horse, cow, dog and cat has a
separate individuality. Children brought up in such associations soon
recognize all these distinctive traits and thereby acquire a much more
broad understanding of the general manifestations of nature than is
possible to the children brought up to look upon such animals with
contempt, if not with dread.

People of average attainments in business, or socially, seldom
appreciate how much contact with domestic animals has to do with the
development of practical common sense and self-reliance among those who
have been fortunate enough to spend their early days in an agricultural
environment.

On every farm of any importance, the daily routine must to a certain
degree take into account the varying individual traits and capacities
of the farm animals. The boy who has grown up in these surroundings and
who has been taught to restrain his impatience, to exercise forbearance
and to help induce the sense of felicity and general comfort among the
domestic animals on a farm, which is essential to their well-being,
has incidentally laid the foundations for the development of that good
judgment which usually determines the difference between success and
failure.


The Story of a Wandering Sheep

The sheep is generally regarded as a very uninteresting animal, but
occasionally there is an exception.

A man who had a small farm, stocked mostly with cattle, had a few sheep
which he kept in a small pasture by themselves. Among this flock was
a young masculine who had gradually acquired the opinion that he was
an unusually brilliant and promising sheep. In order to exhibit the
good opinion he had of himself he developed a pugnacious tendency and a
disposition to wander about. Escaping from the pasture, he was reported
one day as being a trespasser on the farm of a near neighbor.

The following evening the owner of the young sheep proceeded to the
neighbor\xE2\x80\x99s farm to reclaim the wanderer and put him back where he
belonged. It had been a showery day and everything was saturated with
rain. Approaching the farmyard where the strayed sheep was reported
to be, the owner saw the wife of the farmer engaged in milking a cow.
Incidentally, he saw the sheep on the other side of the cow from the
matron. And almost immediately he saw other developments. The sheep
had been regarded with strong disfavor by the strange cows with which
he was surrounded and with a spirit of resentment he suddenly started
head down at the cow being milked. Although the lady who was busily
engaged in the milking process was totally unconscious of what was
happening, it was not so with the cow. Just at the psychological
moment, the cow sprang forward and the sheep came in violent contact
with the lady and the milk pail. The impact was so great that the woman
was thrown over backward in the soft mud of the barnyard, the contents
of the pail being liberally distributed about her robust person.

Although the physical injury was not serious, the damage to the lady\xE2\x80\x99s
dignity was such that the owner of the sheep decided that it was a very
inappropriate time to claim his missing property and hastily beat his
retreat to make his reappearance when the lady\xE2\x80\x99s wrath had somewhat
subsided.

       *       *       *       *       *

While the lady sheep is a model of amiability under practically all
circumstances, as before suggested, the male of the species develops
egotism at a very early date; he also develops a tendency to resent
anything and everything that reflects upon his dignity. So, while
it is entirely appropriate to emphasize the educational advantages
of farm life to growing boys and girls as calculated to develop many
desirable qualities, it is easily possible for such contact to result
disastrously to the young male sheep as evidenced by the following
depressing incident.


The Young and \xE2\x80\x9CSelf-Centered\xE2\x80\x9D Ram

Another young and somewhat self-centered male sheep had been tantalized
by small boys until his dignity was deeply wounded. He was one of
two or three that followed a herd of cows around a large pasture on
a dairy farm. In a certain portion of this enclosure there were some
wild raspberry bushes, and a certain estimable scrub woman of the
neighborhood went to the pasture one day to pick some berries. There
was something about this woman that didn\xE2\x80\x99t meet with the approval of
the young sheep and he made a sudden attack which resulted in the loss
of the berries and incidentally produced a few bruises. The woman
escaped from the pasture and went to the farmhouse and expressed her
indignation that any such wild beast should be allowed to be at large
to commit assaults on the neighbors. The owner of the sheep, a very
amiable man, apologized profusely and directed that the animal be
kept in confinement, at least until the berry season was over. He was
therefore confined in a ramshackle stable, tied behind a loose board.

Enter the villains of this tragedy! four small boys, each armed with a
small, harmless, but otherwise objectionable birch stick. The prisoner
glared at them, whereupon one after another they advanced and tapped
the young ram playfully on the nose with their sticks. In violent
resentment he would lunge forward against the loose board, making a
tremendous racket. Although this enterprise only lasted a few minutes
before it became tiresome to the gamins in question, it was sufficient
to completely wreck whatever might have been previously left of this
sheep\xE2\x80\x99s amiability. He became an anarchist then and there.

The next morning was rainy and there was no probability that any berry
pickers would visit the pasture, so the sheep which had expressed his
dissatisfaction by many loud protests during the previous days, was
gladly released to be allowed to go at large. It was here that Grim
Tragedy stalked forth. The farmyard was a quagmire as a result of the
rain and as one of the older \xE2\x80\x9Cboys\xE2\x80\x9D started to carefully pick his way
through the mud with two brimming milk pails, the sheep caught sight of
him and decided that this was the time to avenge some of those insults
of the day before. Just as the young man was crossing the deepest
portion of the bog, he was made the victim of a rear attack. The result
can easily be imagined. In his great wrath, extricating himself, he
cornered the pugnacious sheep and changed him into mutton in a very few
seconds.

It has been stated before that contact with the various animal
inhabitants of a well equipped farm is in itself an educational process
of no small value; it may be added that there is often as much
diversion as education in these experiences.


The Sudden Enlightenment of the Young Pup

Much has been written of geese and their superior mental qualities as
compared with other fowl. It is true that they are wise in certain ways
and that the average hen is very stupid by comparison. But the hen is
a never-ending source of amusement to many people, especially when
zealously engaged in bringing up a brood. It might be almost assumed
that the hen has reasoning power at times, as for example:

A collie puppy was added to the equipment of a certain farm and after
a few days he began to make a general tour of investigation. He seemed
to find the young chickens about as interesting as anything and while
doing them no injury he would nose them about to the terror of the
chickens and the great indignation of the mother hens. At a time
of emergency some noble figure should always step forward and this
emergency was no exception. Early one morning the pup was seen flying
across the yard, uttering the most agonizing cries, one of the maternal
hens standing squarely in the middle of his back, incidentally giving
him her opinion of dogs in general and himself in particular. The hen
hopped off and went back to the chickens and the puppy was absolutely
cured. He had no further curiosity in that direction.


A Hen Heroine

Another true instance of hen wisdom deals with an ancient female
of that species, who had lived to ripe old age because of her
extraordinarily good judgment in bringing up chickens. One day the
owner heard a great outcry. Looking out she saw the hen engaged in a
vigorous battle with a crow. It may be incidentally mentioned that
while the crow does not ordinarily molest young chickens, there are
exceptions and this was a very bold marauder indeed. However, he
reckoned without his host, as the old hen had lived long enough and had
acquired sufficient knowledge of crow depravity to meet the emergency
in a business-like way. She viciously attacked and continued to fight
the crow, who was unable to get in a position to fly away, until help
arrived and the crow was promptly dispatched. No young fowl, a year
or two old, would have had the requisite courage, but this hen, who
had long since passed the stage of edibility as poultry, had gradually
developed the intelligence and pluck to fight the crow with his own
weapons.

It is often pathetic to see how difficult it is for a normal small boy
who lives in the crowded sections of a big city to find any legitimate
outlet for his energies. He grows up with relatively few opportunities
to develop any sense of personal responsibility. Not so the boy on the
New England farm. If it is a real farm and conducted as a means of
livelihood for the family, responsibility is constantly camping on his
trail.


The Story of the \xE2\x80\x9CLolling\xE2\x80\x9D Horse

Two farm boys about ten years of age who lived in a period when there
were no automobiles, had early been accustomed to the care of farm
animals and had incidentally had some casual experiences in driving
horses.

One day they were given permission to visit a married cousin of one
of the boys at her home some miles away. For the first time in their
young lives they were allowed to start out alone with a horse and
buggy. It was a great occasion and they began their journey with much
anticipation, but before they had gone a mile Dull Care had settled
upon them and attended them continuously until their return in the
early evening.

Only a short time before, one of the boys heard a distressing story
relating to an ox that had died from being overheated. A premonitory
symptom of the approaching demise of the ox had been that he \xE2\x80\x9Clolled.\xE2\x80\x9D
This had made a deep impression on the boy who heard the story.

It would hardly seem to be necessary to explain that of all domestic
animals, the horse is the only one which perspires freely. This affords
relief to the horse when hard at work on a warm day. And it of course
provides a clue to his condition. The teamster will not push his
overheated team horses too hard. With the ox team it is different. Heat
exhaustion may be near and still there will be little or no evidence
of such condition, the most characteristic symptom, however, being the
tendency of the ox to \xE2\x80\x9Cloll\xE2\x80\x9D or allow his tongue to protrude from his
mouth in his panting efforts to perform his task.

Therefore with this bovine tragedy fresh in mind it is easy to imagine
the consternation of these two holiday seekers, when, after jogging
along at a comfortable pace for a mile or two, the horse, beginning to
show some evidence of perspiration, and turning his head to snap at a
pestiferous fly, disclosed the fact that his tongue was protruding.
The boys looked at each other with horror. What had they done? The
none too reluctant animal was restrained to a slow walk and after a
time the boys saw with great relief that he had his tongue back in his
mouth where a horse\xE2\x80\x99s tongue ought to be. They slowly made their way to
the home of their hostess and, not wishing to disclose the fact that
they had been overdriving their horse, they carefully refrained from
speaking of the heavy weight of anxiety with which they were oppressed.
They made an early start for home and after a slow, tedious journey
in the hottest part of the day, they arrived and turned over their
horse apparently as sound as when they had taken him in charge. Their
mysterious manner, however, caused interest and when the facts were
made clear, it afforded much amusement to the two families who could
not refrain from making subsequent allusions to \xE2\x80\x9Cthe lolling horse.\xE2\x80\x9D
It may be said in explanation that the horse in question merely had a
little habit of occasionally protruding his tongue, which the boys had
never happened to notice before. It may be taken for granted, however,
that the sense of responsibility thus displayed by the boys, was not
lost sight of by their elders.

And it may also be assumed that the next time that horse was driven by
those boys, he was not permitted to lag on his journey.

       *       *       *       *       *

The common exchange of farm implements, wagons, or sleds, in rural New
England, does not generally include the loaning of team horses. The
average farm horse, as before suggested, has his special individuality,
and it is not a difficult thing for a work horse to get demoralized
in the hands of a strange driver. In such cases, he may become very
reluctant to take hold and pull a heavy load.


The Farmer Who Borrowed the Blind Horse

A certain farmer, however, had a horse which he was always ready to
turn over to any responsible borrower. The horse was blind and his
age had long been a matter of conjecture. One day a neighbor, unaware
of the extraordinary docility of this poor, blind beast, asked if he
could have the horse to drive eight or ten miles on a necessary errand.
Permission was readily granted and he led the horse home, harnessed
him, and started out. He succeeded in getting back home in the middle
of the night. The next morning he led the horse back to the owner.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is my custom,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cto pay for a borrowed horse in praising,
but this time I want to pay some other way.\xE2\x80\x9D

Just how much blindness had to do with the total lack of courage
of this borrowed horse would be hard to say, but it was probably a
contributing factor.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is sometimes hinted that people who have retained health and
comparative youthfulness to an advanced age, have reason to thank
themselves for the excellent judgment they have manifested in avoiding
undue exertion rather than for any unusual inherited vigor. There are,
however, other factors besides the avoidance of physical labor to be
considered, as for example, cheerful temperament and an active, alert
mind. This latter quality seems to hold good with the animal creation
as shown by the following example.


The Lame Horse That Was Suddenly Cured

A young couple, who had arrived at a state of mind in which there
was considerable mutual interest, found it very desirable one day to
take a little drive. Their parents lived on two adjoining farms and
it was a busy season. Spare horses were scarce. Finally an agreement
was reached. The young lady agreed to furnish horse and harness if
her companion would furnish the buggy. This seemed to be a practical
arrangement and they started gayly out on their trip. After lunch in
town, there seemed to be nothing else to do but start for home, but
they were in no great hurry to arrive there, so at a certain turn in
the road they decided to make a detour.

The little Morgan mare of quite advanced age, contributed by the
young lady as her quota of the team, had very peculiar ideas. She
thoroughly disapproved of the trip in the first place, and secondly the
young man\xE2\x80\x99s driving was also entirely different from anything she was
accustomed to. At the prospect of returning home, however, she seemed
to cheer up amazingly until she found herself being turned off on the
side road. She moped along for a few yards and then began to be very
lame.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a nice prospect!\xE2\x80\x9D said the driver. \xE2\x80\x9CI think we had better turn
straight around and get home, if we can.\xE2\x80\x9D

The young lady was quite well acquainted with the little white mare.

\xE2\x80\x9CLet me take those reins,\xE2\x80\x9D said she.

She took over the reins and gave the poor, lame horse a couple of
slashes with the whip and a miracle was performed. The lameness was
cured in an instant.

One of the most frequent tragedies of agricultural life is where some
farmer allows himself to feel that he has somehow lost a considerable
part of the pleasures of life by living remote from town. In such a
case the farmer, if well to do, may dispose of his farm and move to
a nearby village. And then, far too often, physical and even mental
degeneration will soon be in evidence. Lack of occupation is no doubt
a considerable factor, but the loss of the interest and congenial
companionship associated with domestic animals is probably no small
item in this disintegration.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the consideration of animal life and its influence upon farm
environment, the wild birds should not be overlooked. As with the human
race, these birds present the varying characteristics of those who are
helpful and popular and those who constitute a problem.


The Bird Policeman

The crow is both a pest and a useful citizen. He is not nearly as
popular with the average farmer as he ought to be. It is the old story
of the roughneck\xE2\x80\x99s total contempt for the opinion of his neighbors,
human or otherwise. The crow\xE2\x80\x99s attitude is in general as follows: \xE2\x80\x9CYou
can\xE2\x80\x99t put anything over on me.\xE2\x80\x9D He is an ardent believer in \xE2\x80\x9Ccollective
bargaining\xE2\x80\x9D and when it is desirable to raid a field of ripe corn, the
entire crow colony is carefully organized for the purpose. Pickets
will be established to warn of the approach of any man with a gun.

But, however sardonic may be the attitude of Mr. Crow toward the poor,
plodding human farmers, he is quick to recognize his master, the
kingbird.

In a certain farmyard the crows and hawks had established a reign
of terror among the hens and chickens. Broods of chickens would be
depleted one by one until there were few survivors and the women of the
household became thoroughly exasperated. This went on to a greater or
less extent for several years. One bright June morning a certain Mr.
and Mrs. Kingbird arrived from a more southern clime and looked the
premises over. They decided that there was an excellent opportunity
to establish a home in one of the shade trees. They had hardly got
at work, however, before the male bird found it necessary to take up
a certain line of police duties. He discovered that the crows and
hawks had been making themselves very much at home in that immediate
neighborhood.

Within twenty-four hours the word had gone around to all the marauders,
and for years thereafter they never came near those premises again.
Each season the kingbird and his wife would come back. That was
sufficient protection for the young chickens who could scratch about
within the limits of their enclosure with perfect safety. It can be
taken for granted that everything was done by the owners of the farm
to make it pleasant for the bird policeman, who by his extraordinary
activities and fearlessness strikes terror to the heart of the swiftest
hawk, lest he be blinded by one of the lightning dashes of the kingbird
who always aims for the eyes.


The Evicted Swallows

At the same farm some swallows had established a system of commodious
mud dwellings under the eaves of the south and east side of the
barn. They occupied these premises year after year with apparent
satisfaction. One spring they were abruptly and summarily dispossessed,
although allowed to re-establish themselves on the other side of the
building. This is but a mere detail in bird life. The warm southeastern
exposure looked good to some bluebirds and they promptly evicted those
who had apparently secured the right of possession by a long lease.


The Proprietary Attitude of the Robins

Robins, to most people, are merely robins. It would surprise the
average city inhabitant however, perhaps, to know that even the robin
may be individualized by farm dwellers, so that a certain old cock
robin who has been coming back, presumably with the same wife, year
after year, is promptly recognized on his arrival. In advanced years
the cock robin sometimes seems to develop obesity or at least great
abdominal extension, which may quite naturally be due to gradual
indisposition to labor but with no compensating tendency to reduce
rations. This is, however, so frequently observed in other male bipeds
that it should not occasion surprise.

The robin is perhaps the most popular of birds in the rural districts.
It is an unwritten law among native New Englanders that they shall
not be harassed or molested. The house cat which has been detected
catching a robin is in great disfavor immediately.

About the first sure indication of actual spring in this section is
the appearance of these welcome birds whose cheerfulness seems to be
contagious. They seem to be socially inclined toward humans and are
quite apt to locate their nests in close proximity to some farmhouse.
Indeed at times they seem to assume a rather proprietary attitude
toward the farm owners themselves, as shown by the following typical
incident.

One sultry day in July, it was noted at a certain farmhouse, that
there seemed to be considerable excitement among the robins. They
were unusually vociferous and someone wise to their habits suggested
that probably the young birds were about ready to make their first
trial flights. On the Sunday morning in question, most of the family
had gone to church when a certain slacker, who was left behind, took
his comfortable seat on the porch facing the lawn. The house dog was
lying on the grass nearby and all was quiet among the robins with
one exception. The exception was expressing high disapproval of
something. Suddenly there was the chatter of a squirrel in a clump of
trees a short distance away, and the dog arose to his feet and started
leisurely down to investigate. When he had gone about fifty feet there
suddenly developed a perfect din of protest, several robins joining
in the chorus to explain to the dog how unwelcome he was and no doubt
including various other uncomplimentary comments.

It was plainly depressing to the dog; he had had no quarrel with the
robins and saw no reason why they should talk to him in such abusive
terms. He came dejectedly back to his original location and lay down.
The chorus of disfavor stopped. Meantime, however, the robin in the
tree directly in front of the porch continued his tirade. Finally
the dog again arose and went around the corner, the man on the porch
decided to go in the house, and immediately all clamour ceased.


The Haunted Cat

At another farmhouse there were two well fed and properly cared for
cats actively engaged in the ever necessary warfare against mice. A
colony of swallows had built their nests under the eaves of a large
barn. So far as the human inhabitants of the farm could know there
was no essential difference in the moral characters of the two cats.
But while one of these cats could circulate around the buildings and
no swallow would seem to take any interest in the matter, as soon as
the other cat made her appearance in the space between the house and
barn, various active members of the swallow colony would immediately
issue forth from their retreat and proceed to swoop around and around
the cat a few feet from the ground, to her great discomfiture and
embarrassment. It became practically impossible for the cat to go out
of doors without undergoing this ordeal. She became a nervous wreck and
finally had to avoid this open area and take her promenades in another
direction.

It would be interesting to know just why the swallows made such a
discrimination between the two cats. Possibly the object of their
resentment had some time succeeded in capturing one of the birds, but
such an achievement by a cat is not very common, as the swallows are
extremely agile and capable of keeping out of reach. And if one cat
had become unpopular for this cause, why should not the swallows have
adopted aggressive and protective tactics toward the other cat who
might naturally be expected to follow the same predatory instinct if
given the opportunity?

To people who have spent their entire lifetime in the city, these
incidents of animal life might easily seem to be mostly imaginary,
but to those who are of receptive mind and keep a watchful eye upon
the various activities of the animal creation as revealed to them
by residence in the open country, there is presented a panorama of
individual traits, numerous and delightfully varied.




CHAPTER VII

LEGENDS OF RURAL SPOOKS


It must be regretfully stated that the old time folklore of the
supposed supernatural has apparently vanished from modern New England.
Skepticism has seized upon the present generation and such genuine
unalloyed ghost stories as still persist are regarded as the harmless
delusions of old age. Thus, much that furnished thrills in earlier days
has departed.

They were creepy enough, those ancient tales. And in most instances
they were vouched for as strictly true by people whose reputations for
veracity were beyond dispute.


The Ghost in the Milk Dairy

Take the story of the milk pans as an example. The people who occupied
the milk pan infested residence were an intelligent church going family
of the highest standing. They were not superstitious and in fact
regarded their spooky experiences as a joke. They had a dairy farm at
a period when cream separators were unknown.

The process at that time was to \xE2\x80\x9Cset\xE2\x80\x9D the milk in shallow tin pans
and skim off the cream when the milk had become sour. The cream was
then made into butter. Where there were quite a number of cows, a
considerable stack of these tin pans was required. Such as were not in
use would be placed in an orderly pile on a high shelf in the milk room.

Therefore, it can be readily understood that if one of these pans was
to slide off the shelf to the floor, it would make a loud noise.

Now, suppose the farmer and his family were sitting around the evening
lamp and all at once an unearthly din in the milk room should indicate
that a dozen or perhaps two dozen of those six-quart milk pans had
rolled from the top shelf to the floor, we would naturally expect one
or more members of the family to go at once to investigate.

Well, this highly respectable and truthful family would do nothing
of the kind. They would remain quietly reading the weekly paper, or
knitting, or popping corn, according to age and disposition; because
they knew no milk pans had stirred an inch. It was merely the spook
amusing himself.


The Spook Story of the Runaway Horse

A family lived on a back hilly road, and where the highway passed
their house it was quite steep. Comparatively few teams would be seen
during the day and still fewer would be abroad at night. It therefore
might be expected that when all the sounds of a horse galloping wildly
down the road with a rattling wagon at his heels should be heard, the
people would rush to the windows and doors to find out whose horse was
subjecting his driver to probable injury or sudden death; but they
didn\xE2\x80\x99t--at least after the first few times. They knew no horse was
running away; it was only the spook.

And still there are people in this age of jazz who think the \xE2\x80\x9Cold
times\xE2\x80\x9D had no excitement.

Most of the practical jokes of the spook were harmless, but in a given
instance he seems to have gone rather too far.


Table Tipping and a Victim

As could be expected a certain number of people were disposed to take
these \xE2\x80\x9Cmanifestations\xE2\x80\x9D quite seriously, regardless of the ridicule of
their neighbors. A group of these seekers after occult knowledge had
gathered one evening to engage in their favorite avocation of \xE2\x80\x9Ctable
tipping,\xE2\x80\x9D and were unusually favored with \xE2\x80\x9Csigns.\xE2\x80\x9D The small table
around which they were seated became so totally unmindful of the force
of gravity that a recent novitiate of corpulent figure was induced to
seat himself upon it to keep it in place. No sooner had he taken his
position than the table began to float about the room.

It was a triumphant moment for the believers. They were succeeding
beyond their wildest anticipations. The table, after various
oscillations, approached the stairway, still carrying the portly
investigator. Clinging to it were a number of enthusiasts who stumbled
up the stairway well toward the top. Suddenly the invisible force
weakened, and the table with its burden, fell with a crash.

The victim was considerably bruised but otherwise physically uninjured.
His vanity had however received a hard jolt and he took no further part
in the s\xC3\xA9ances.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is significance in the fact that although most people of the
rural districts long ago lost interest in \xE2\x80\x9Cspirit\xE2\x80\x9D phenomena, it has
lately engaged the attention of city dwellers to an increasing extent.
Such investigations passed under the ban of country people because of
the current impression that they were generally demoralizing in their
influence. Those who maintained the churches were skeptical and this
developed antagonisms, which affected attendance upon church and Sunday
school. The \xE2\x80\x9Couija board\xE2\x80\x9D is about all there is left of the old time
manifestations in rural New England.


The Story of the Ouija Board

But even the ouija board can carry consternation to the wayward.

A New England youth of unusually good looks became impressed with
the idea that his face could easily be made to be his fortune. The
matrimonial route seemed to be easiest and after a short courtship he
became the husband of a woman of considerable wealth. To be sure she
was quite deaf and some forty years his senior, but there could be many
collateral diversions. His elation was short lived. The old lady had
not lived so many years without acquiring wisdom. She promptly added
to her other bridal accessories a \xE2\x80\x9Couija\xE2\x80\x9D with which she soon became
proficient.

Before his marriage the young husband had made the acquaintance of
numerous fair ones of whom chorus girls seemed the most congenial. But
he soon found it wise to avoid their company. With her faithful ouija,
his wife could have him shadowed at all hours of the day. It was too
uncanny. He became the most docile and punctilious of husbands.

Coincidence often assumes an uncanny resemblance to the so-called
supernatural. Instances in which a certain type of dream was followed
by disaster are common to all classes of people. But what is to be said
of \xE2\x80\x9Csigns\xE2\x80\x9D during waking hours? as for example the following legend of
a highly intelligent married couple who would have scorned to palm off
such a narrative unless authentic.


The Unreal Arrival of Uncle Mark

Late one summer evening these middle-aged parents of a considerable
family had just retired to rest, the younger people being long since
abed and asleep. All at once the silence of the farm was broken by the
sound of a horse and buggy coming rapidly up the main road, and which
turned from the highway, passed through the yard and up a driveway into
the horse barn. The farmer and his wife exchanged glances, one of them
remarking that \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Mark,\xE2\x80\x9D a brother of the farmer, was evidently
making one of his customary unannounced visits.

Then followed the familiar sounds of the horse being detached from
the buggy and led into the stall. The farmer hastily readjusting his
clothing, took the lamp and went down stairs to admit the visitor.
Seeing and hearing no one he went down the porch and crossed the yard
to the barn. He found no strange horse, wagon or driver.

When the wife was told that what they had both heard so distinctly was
a delusion, she looked very grave.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat means bad news,\xE2\x80\x9D was all she said.

The farmer and his wife went to bed and let us hope they slept
the sleep of the just. The next morning a telegram announced the
sudden death of a near relative. It would be hard to convince any of
their descendants that this fine old couple had betrayed any weak
superstitious delusions in describing this mysterious combination of
happenings.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is probable that the experienced traveling salesman is about as near
immune to superstitious thrills as any type of citizen, but in one
specific case even his iron nerve gave way.


The Locked Door Which Swung Open

A young man of exceptional vigor and equipoise, traveling through a
hilly country, had occasion to make a late journey across a mountain.
The road was poor and the traveling tedious and he found that he had
sadly miscalculated the time required to complete the trip. He decided
to stop at the first likely looking farmhouse and beg for a chance to
stay over night.

By this time it was very dark but he was able to get a glimpse of
two or three cabins on the way that seemed too utterly unattractive
for consideration. Finally he came to a more commodious looking
establishment and decided to go no further if he could possibly avoid
it. Stopping his horse in front of the house he hallooed several times.
There was no answer, so inferring the inhabitants were sound sleepers,
the young man concluded to first find shelter for his horse and then
come back and in some way or other secure a night\xE2\x80\x99s lodging for himself.

An outbuilding was located and unharnessing his horse, he tied him to a
beam and after giving the animal some hay and a bedding of the same,
he went back to the farmhouse, intending to pound on the door until he
aroused the inmates. But he did not pound on the door.

As the weary traveler approached the front step, the door began to
turn, swung around slowly and finally stood wide open. There was not
the slightest noise nor sign of any human agency associated with the
door. Every individual hair arose on the young man\xE2\x80\x99s head. He thought
with joy and relief of that good, faithful animal munching his dry hay.
He hastened back to the shed, lay down as near the horse as safety
would permit, and so managed to pass the night.

At daybreak he resumed his journey, but before leaving he observed
positive evidences that the house was uninhabited. The door was locked!

It is probable that had the salesman had the time and disposition to
make a careful daylight inspection of the vacant house, he might have
discovered some perfectly natural cause for the mysterious actions of
the front door. But his curiosity was not very active just then.

       *       *       *       *       *

In another instance, the investigations of a traveling salesman nearly
caused a case of sudden death by heart failure.


The Joke Played on the Hotel Porter

This young man found himself marooned for the Sabbath at a little
hotel in a back country town. Sunday afternoon, finding nothing better
to do, he proceeded to put the blas\xC3\xA9 hotel clerk through a third
degree examination in regard to any local points of interest which
might alleviate the general tiresomeness of the situation. The only
interesting feature apparently possessed by the town was a haunted
house guaranteed to be genuine in every respect.

There was the usual legend of some ghastly tragedy, and the record of
spookish antics, frequently associated with such histories. Altogether
the salesman was disposed to consider this a real find and worth
looking after.

The most conspicuous member of the hotel staff was a colored porter.
Bland and attentive, this young man took his position very seriously
indeed. The salesman became very chummy with the porter. He found
several occasions to utilize his services and showed his appreciation
by liberal tips. It therefore seemed only natural to the porter that
the salesman should propose that he have his company for an evening\xE2\x80\x99s
stroll to look over the town, especially as the suggestion was
associated with the promise of an extra half dollar.

In his conversation with the clerk, the salesman had learned the
general location of the haunted house, and waiting until it was quite
dark he started out in that direction with his escort. He remarked on
the darkness of the night, saying it was just the kind of a night for
ghosts to be on duty. Finally he asked his companion if he knew of any
haunted houses in town. The porter rather reluctantly admitted that he
did know of one and that they were getting pretty near to it.

By this time the porter had evidently lost interest in the excursion
and suggested that he would be needed at the hotel. He was, however,
prevailed upon to go a little further. Shortly afterward, there loomed
up a large old-fashioned dwelling surrounded by considerable grounds
which he pronounced to be the haunted house. It was uninhabited, of
course.

The porter again urged that he would be needed at the hotel, but the
salesman insisted that he must get a little nearer before going back.
When nearly opposite the house, he stopped and took a careful look at
the building which now looked dismal enough in the dim starlight.

The salesman was possessed of a voice that he could make unusually
penetrating. He suddenly gave a tremendous leap backward and yelled in
a most agonizing tone.

\xE2\x80\x9CGreat Heavens! What is that?\xE2\x80\x9D

But his companion did not answer. He disappeared down the road at a
pace that no professional sprinter could excel.

       *       *       *       *       *

In \xE2\x80\x9Cthe good old days\xE2\x80\x9D a ghost seems to have generally appeared
to investigate any unusually spectacular murder. This came about
according to custom following the celebrated pedlar mystery.


The Pedlar Who Disappeared

A German Jew had built up a profitable trade among the farmers in a
certain section and was looked for every summer by his customers. He
traveled with a horse and cart and carried a considerable stock of
silks for dresses and heavy black broadcloth for men\xE2\x80\x99s suits. Another
item of considerable importance in his business was a choice stock of
Paisley shawls.

The prosperous farmer of that period was expected to provide his wife
with at least one black silk dress in addition to the one she may have
had as a part of her wedding outfit, the shawl adding the final touch
of elegance to her wardrobe.

Naturally the wife would expect her husband to be dressed according to
her standard, and that meant at least one new broadcloth suit every
ten or fifteen years. Therefore the pedlar could always count upon a
considerable number of sales and it can be taken for granted that he
made at least a fair profit.

It was, however, often necessary for him to extend credit as actual
money was very scarce in those times. But he knew his customers and
rather encouraged this class of business.

One season the pedlar made his usual rounds, did a considerable credit
business, delivering his goods as usual and--was never seen again.

The farmers who had provided themselves with funds to settle their
accounts could not understand the case. The pedlar was apparently the
last man of their acquaintance to neglect his collections. Time passed,
the year rolled around and nothing was heard. It was indeed a mystery.

One day a marvelous story went the rounds. A well-known young man
announced that he could keep his secret no longer. He had a confession
to make.

He said that about the time of the pedlar\xE2\x80\x99s last visit, returning home
one evening, he had overtaken two men on a lonely road through the
woods, who were carrying a heavy burden wrapped in a blanket. Finding
they were discovered the men had required him, on penalty of death, to
help them bury a man\xE2\x80\x99s body. It was the pedlar.

Pressed for details as to the identity of the probable murderers, he
named two well-known business men of a nearby town who, presumably,
tempted by the large sums of money habitually carried by the pedlar,
had committed the crime.

The accused were naturally placed under arrest, but their denials of
the crime were not vehement as might have been expected, but were
calmly contemptuous. They arranged their affairs as best they could
and settled down to endure confinement in the county jail as patiently
as possible until the next session of court. There does not seem to
have been any evidence to corroborate the testimony of the principal
witness, and when he later appeared before the county prosecutor and
told him the alleged confession was merely a romance suggested to his
mind through a badly distorted sense of humor, there was nothing
further to be done with the alleged murderers except to release them.

While in these latter days such a hoax on the authorities would likely
prove unpleasant to the joker, he apparently escaped any legal penalty.
But he found it expedient to shortly leave the neighborhood, as the
theory was promptly advanced that the original confession was really
justified, but that the witness had in some manner been induced by the
accused parties to retract, probably by a liberal bribe. His later
prosperity in a large New England city was generally attributed to this
source by censorious former neighbors, although others, probably better
informed, were aware that he was a highly paid and valued employee in a
large mercantile establishment.

This would seem to be the logical end of this narrative, but although
the subsequent history of the case can be rather briefly told, what has
been heretofore stated is but the beginning of the story.

Those who had been accused of the crime did not follow the example of
the unreliable witness, but remained to spend the balance of their
days attending to their usual occupations in the town where they had
lived so long. One of these men was considerably older than the other,
and although there had been no special intimacy apparent between the
two from year to year, when the older man eventually developed what
promised to be a fatal illness, the other promptly gave over his
business to a subordinate and took up his abode at the home of the sick
man. Day after day, and in fact night after night, he was always at
the invalid\xE2\x80\x99s call and it was generally and plausibly reported that no
one was left alone with the sick man from that time until his death.
Naturally those who enjoyed the sensational, immediately assumed that
the attendant was afraid to permit his former alleged associate in
crime any opportunity for private conversation with others lest he
unburden his mind by a confession.

Enter the ghost!

During the last years of the man so carefully watched by his partner,
he lived in a large old-fashioned house on a back street, surrounded
by ample grounds. The household consisted solely of himself and an
elderly woman acting as a domestic. The man was to a considerable
extent a recluse, but whenever he had occasion to leave his home after
nightfall, which was seldom, his housekeeper would immediately make
haste to visit a friend. She declared that nothing would induce her
to stay in alone at night, because of numerous uncanny noises and
especially certain dismal groans proceeding from some never fully
revealed part of the house. Coincidentally with the death of the owner
these spookish manifestations ceased. Many long years have passed
since that time and the house is still standing in good preservation.
It has been occupied by different families during this time and only
the oldest inhabitants remember that at one time it was regarded as
harboring a ghost.

All the actors in this tragedy or comedy have long since passed away,
but the legend persists as one of the most unique old-time mysteries of
New England.

The skeptical reader might easily dismiss the foregoing history as
being in all probability the result of too much imagination and rural
credulity, but those who vouch for another story of \xE2\x80\x9Chants\xE2\x80\x9D are still
living and their testimony is absolutely beyond question.


The Sudden Discontinuance of the \xE2\x80\x9CSpirit Raps\xE2\x80\x9D

A young couple with an infant child occupied a typical New England
house located on a thriving farm. The house was in a good state of
preservation and the residents were healthy and normal in every
respect. Their sleeping room, however, became widely noted among their
acquaintances. It was fairly infested with \xE2\x80\x9Cspirit raps.\xE2\x80\x9D

The exhibit was usually about as follows: Soon after retiring and while
perhaps getting into the drowsy stage that borders upon dreamland, a
series of raps would suddenly start on the ceiling and pass diagonally
across the room. After moving from the farthest corner the raps would
gradually seem to come down the wall at the head of the bed, at which
point raps would be heard on the wooden headboard and upon the pillows.
This occurred on numerous occasions and became quite a nuisance.

One evening the young couple went to bed unusually fatigued from a hard
day\xE2\x80\x99s exertions. Just as they settled down to sleep, the raps started
in louder than usual. Exasperated by these unwelcome noises, the
husband suddenly expressed his mind. He told his wife that he wished
those certain kind of spirits would go back to Hades where they came
from and let him sleep.

It was not surprising that he should have lost patience, but it was
surprising that the raps did then and there cease, never again to be
heard.

       *       *       *       *       *

Another old-time story of the mysterious was told by a young woman
whose Puritanic regard for strict veracity was almost a joke to her
friends.


The Supernatural Illumination

With her young child in the cradle, she was sitting in the early
evening in a room which looked out upon an open space of ground
including the driveway. Save for the child, she was absolutely alone
in the house. It was a very thick, starless night, threatening rain.
At her back as she sat in the darkness, resting from her labors and
thinking that she must get a light and do some sewing, there was a
window almost entirely hidden by vines which were allowed to shade that
part of the room, there being other windows to furnish light.

Suddenly there flashed on the wall before her a bright reflection of
the vine-covered window, the frame standing out clear and distinct as
though there were no vines at all. She looked at this reflection with
great astonishment a moment, sprang to her feet, opened the door and
started out on the porch which commanded a complete view of the entire
front of the house and the open field beyond. There was not a sound nor
a sign of anybody abroad. It is asked in the Scriptures if a woman can
forget her sucking child, but in this instance she could, for she ran
down the road like a wild thing to a nearby house, where she secured
the companionship and moral support of a kindly old woman, and returned
for the protection of her sleeping infant.

To the present generation these tales of the supernatural would be
generally regarded as rubbish. Those who lived in years of maturity a
half century ago would hardly be inclined to so classify them. On the
contrary, they would regard them as unsolved mysteries existing at the
time, often amusing and seldom terrifying. Let those of that era be the
judges.




CHAPTER VIII

TALES OF RURAL LAWYERS AND THE COURTS


The fact that there are many amusing fiascoes in running through the
regular grist of rural court cases should not in any way reflect upon
the personnel of the members of the legal bar. The section in which
most of the following incidents occurred has been noted for a century
for the exceptional ability and commanding personality of its lawyers.
But any attorney engaged in general law practice is continually turning
up something which, if commonly known, would be regarded as ranking
high in the field of humor.

       *       *       *       *       *

An attorney, who during his career became widely known throughout the
country in general, was for a long time active in practice as a country
lawyer in a little town. No case was too great or too little to command
his attention.


The Litigating Horse Dealer

Among his clients was a farmer who was also engaged in horse trading.
It might perhaps be said that horse trading was his principal
occupation. This man was an enthusiast. Any horse he happened to own
was a living wonder. He sold horses, but most generally his method was
to exchange his own for some other horse, each of the parties of the
trade trusting to their wits to get the better of the other.

As this man, whose first name was Oliver, was extremely fluent
regarding the merits of his horses, there were frequent cases in which
the party of the second part was disappointed. When the new owner would
compare the horse itself as revealed to him by actual contact and
use, with the glowing recommendations of the dealer at the time the
trade was made, righteous indignation would often lead to a demand for
satisfaction. In such cases he would receive no consideration whatever
and if he had the real genuine spunk of the period, he would engage a
lawyer and begin legal proceedings at once.

This was at a time when petty litigation was extremely frequent and
encouraged by the legal profession. Pacifists were not in fashion and
those who were too dignified to settle disputes with their fists, would
maintain their self-respect by starting a lawsuit. This class of court
cases is pretty generally frowned upon at present, as the standards
of the legal profession have advanced steadily the past century,
maintaining a close parallel with the similar ethical development of
the medical profession.

When Oliver became involved in one of these occasional disputes, he
would promptly refer the matter to his attorney, who generally managed
to extricate him from even the most unpleasant situation. There was one
occasion, however, when this eminent attorney was almost inclined not
to act.

After an unusually successful horse trade, Oliver one day appeared at
his attorney\xE2\x80\x99s office with a rather grave face.

\xE2\x80\x9CSaul,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI traded horses with a man over on Scrabble Hill and
he is all stirred up about it. He has put the matter in his lawyer\xE2\x80\x99s
hands and thinks he is going to be able to make out a strong case.
What do you think I better do about it?\xE2\x80\x9D

The lawyer regarded the matter calmly. It was hardly necessary to ask
any questions. The details of such transactions were apt to bear a
strong similarity in different trades.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat can you prove?\xE2\x80\x9D he asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CHang it! Saul!\xE2\x80\x9D said Oliver. \xE2\x80\x9CIt isn\xE2\x80\x99t a question of what I can prove;
it is what I have to prove.\xE2\x80\x9D

The attorney, therefore, although not especially edified at this kind
of professional routine, proceeded to give Oliver an outline of the
kind of testimony that he should be able to produce to offset the
righteous claims of his opponent. Tradition says that Oliver was nearly
always prepared to furnish the evidence, having some very accommodating
friends and neighbors.


The Attorney Who Scorned Divorce Business

In a certain locality in northern New England there was a journeyman
tinsmith who was nearing his thirtieth birthday. This young man,
although possessed of much natural wit and ingenuity in argument, had
never exhibited any desire to better his position. A young girl, of
seventeen or eighteen years, aroused his ambition and he decided to
study law. His mind absorbed information like a sponge, and by teaching
school during the day and studying at night, he was able to prepare
himself for what proved to be a very satisfactory examination for
admission to the bar. His success was immediate. Marrying the girl who
had inspired him to a higher walk in life, he became a brilliant figure
in the legal annals of this period.

At the height of his career his wife died, and just as he had never
manifested the slightest interest in any other girl prior to his
marriage, he was equally indifferent to all other women after the death
of his wife. But apparently to overcome moments of black depression
which assailed him out of business hours, because of his tense grief at
the loss of his wife, he gradually acquired intemperate habits. Then
followed a strange record for a thoroughly modern court, of frequent
cases called in their regular order, quietly transferred further down
the docket list, because of the murmured report of some tipstaff
to the judge that \xE2\x80\x9CJim,\xE2\x80\x9D who was to try the case, was temporarily
incapacitated. Such was the personal regard in which this man was held
that there seldom was an instance where an opposing attorney made any
objection.

[Illustration: A TYPICAL NEW ENGLAND ELM]

Not inconsistent with the foregoing history, was the absolute refusal
of this lawyer to ever have anything to do with divorce practice.
Knowing his contempt for that class of law business, an elderly man one
day climbed his office stairs and appeared before the eminent lawyer.
There ensued a conversation about as follows:

\xE2\x80\x9CJim,\xE2\x80\x9D said the old gentleman, \xE2\x80\x9CI have come to see if I can\xE2\x80\x99t engage
you to help me get a divorce from my wife.\xE2\x80\x9D

The lawyer glared at him and then detecting a humorous twinkle in the
old man\xE2\x80\x99s eyes,

\xE2\x80\x9CHow long have you been married?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

\xE2\x80\x9CFifty-two years,\xE2\x80\x9D was the prompt reply.

Lighting a fresh cigar from the stump of an old one, as he was almost a
continuous smoker, the lawyer promptly dismissed the matter.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, sir; I shall not undertake to get a divorce for you. But you may
go home and tell your wife that if she wants a divorce, I will be glad
to act for her and it won\xE2\x80\x99t cost her a penny.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

The early history of a certain state was associated with considerable
difficulty in establishing a distinct separate existence. The early
settlers therefore became unusually well informed in the general
principles of the juris-prudence of that period. Naturally they did not
allow much time to pass after their state organization was assured,
before establishing a system of county courts.


The Murderer Who Was Not There That Day

In one of the counties there was all the machinery for carrying on
a considerable court business, but affairs were so exceptionally
peaceful that there was very little for the court to do. It was
therefore a matter of pride to the inhabitants of that county when it
became necessary to try a real red-handed murderer.

The judge had little, if any, experience in murder trials, and felt the
importance of the occasion quite seriously. There was great general
interest during the trial and the court room was packed. At last the
case was ready for the jury which filed out, soon returning with the
verdict of guilty. The judge arose and directed the prisoner to stand
before him.

\xE2\x80\x9CPrisoner at the bar,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CYou have been tried by a jury of
your peers, and let us hope, superiors, and have been found guilty of
the crime charged against you. I therefore sentence you, etc., etc.,\xE2\x80\x9D
repeating the usual formula, of which the substance was that he should
be hanged early in the spring following the present session of court,
which was in the late autumn. Then recollecting himself, he said to the
prisoner:

\xE2\x80\x9CIs there any reason why the sentence should not be imposed upon you?\xE2\x80\x9D

The prisoner who had assumed a bored attitude throughout the entire
trial, manifested but languid interest.

\xE2\x80\x9CI dunno as I have anything to say, except that I don\xE2\x80\x99t expect to be
there that day.\xE2\x80\x9D

He was not there that day. The jail was a ramshackle affair at best and
the prisoner, after apparently enjoying the hospitality of the county
during the extreme cold months of the winter, made his getaway a week
or two before the date set for his execution, and was never heard from
again.

       *       *       *       *       *

Perhaps at no time in the history of a certain rural valley was the
legal profession more appreciated than it was following a public
hearing to, if possible, determine who was responsible for an epidemic
of incendiary fires.


A Celebrated Arson Case

Within a relatively few weeks, several sets of unusually fine farm
buildings were one after another destroyed by fire. There was an
incipient reign of terror developing. Farmers all began to wonder who
would be the next victim and little else was talked about in local
gatherings.

Another fire occurred, and it was decided that something must be done.
Finally a public hearing was announced to take place at an early date
and an attorney who lived about ten miles distant was induced to act as
interrogator.

On the appointed date the hall was filled to overflowing as few who
were anywhere within the radius of the fire zone, considered it wise
to remain away. One by one those who had been in attendance at the
various fires were called upon to give their testimony. Finally a young
man was summoned to the stand who it transpired had been present at
every fire. The attorney who conducted the interrogation was a noted
cross-examiner. It seemed unusual to him that the witness before
him should have found it convenient to be practically the first man
at every one of the fires. His manner, however, was friendly and
reassuring and he asked a great many questions. Within fifteen minutes
the audience were looking at each other and nodding their heads.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s got the right man,\xE2\x80\x9D was the verdict.

The attorney, however, was too discreet to indulge in any dramatic
accusations. He dismissed the witness in the blandest manner, after
which the hearing was halted and a discussion among leading citizens
took place. An elderly man of considerable force and personality was
deputized to have a quiet conversation with the young man who had
just been cross-examined. The result in less than half an hour was a
complete confession. The epidemic of fires was over.

It seemed that the guilty man had at the beginning yielded to an
impulse to touch a match to a lock of hay which he saw protruding
from a barn in the outskirts of the village. The resultant fire and
excitement were apparently too much for a brain never any too well
balanced. He found the diversion caused by these fires necessary
to his existence. He was sentenced for a long term and died in the
penitentiary.

The years following the Civil War were productive of a certain type of
attorneys who were more effective with the juries of that period than
they are apt to be at present. They cultivated eloquence to the limit
of their abilities. An attorney who had been an officer in the Civil
War acquired quite a reputation as a spectacular pleader. Especially if
an old soldier was in any way involved in the case, his oratory reached
unusual heights.


The Attorney Who Justified \xE2\x80\x9CAssault and Battery\xE2\x80\x9D

An old veteran of two or three wars was on trial at the county court
for some form of physical assault. Ordinarily harmless, this old chap
would become very pugnacious at times, especially when under the
influence of certain fluids. In this case he had done considerable
damage to the personal appearance of someone in about his own walk in
life and of whom he did not approve. The aggrieved party engaged a
lawyer who succeeded in having the case put upon the court calendar for
jury trial.

The evidence was very damaging to the old veteran and as there seemed
to be no good reason why he should not be taught a lesson, a term in
jail seemed extremely imminent, until the attorney for the defense, the
officer above referred to, began his argument.

The lawyer was named Johnson, and after making the usual rambling
introduction, gradually entered upon a lofty train of thought. He
pictured the hero of the two wars as a man to whom the entire community
was indebted, and pointed out the fact that even his principal
weakness for strong drink was the result of his big heartedness and
fraternal spirit. Proceeding with this line of argument he succeeded
in convincing the intelligent jury that a man who objected to being
battered and bruised by such a hero was not only a poor loser but a
pretty cheap sort of man generally. The result was a verdict of \xE2\x80\x9Cnot
guilty.\xE2\x80\x9D

The old veteran was overwhelmed with admiration for his lawyer\xE2\x80\x99s
ability and his enthusiasm promptly found expression.

Turning to his wife, a withered up old woman of about his own age, he
said:

\xE2\x80\x9CHurrah! We can now go home and if we ever have a boy, we will name him
Thomas V. Johnson.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Lawyer Who Was Going to \xE2\x80\x9CGet Over It\xE2\x80\x9D

An attorney of unquestioned ability had but one failing and one which
was far too common among the legal profession years ago. He was a
periodic. At such times his naturally acute business judgment would
become rather unstable. Like numerous other lawyers of that period,
\xE2\x80\x9CWad,\xE2\x80\x9D as he was generally known among his friends, did some insurance
business as a side line.

\xE2\x80\x9CWad\xE2\x80\x9D was elected to the legislature and immediately took a prominent
place. He was an able debater and fluent speaker and exceedingly
popular. Coming to the capital city from a week end trip to his home,
it was immediately evident that he had been indulging a little too much.

Soon after his return on this occasion Wad wended his way to a certain
insurance office to make a series of settlements for collections
he had made in his home town. As soon as the treasurer saw him he
recognized the situation, but being personally fond of the man, he
hoped to get through with the matter without any complications.

It soon became apparent, however, that Wad was in no condition to
settle any accounts. The problems of addition and subtraction were
entirely too much for him. The treasurer watched with mingled sympathy
and contempt his impotent efforts to group the necessary figures, but
finally lost patience.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou come in some other time, Wad,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CThere is no hurry. You
can just as well settle this matter some other time.\xE2\x80\x9D

The attorney paid absolutely no attention to this suggestion and
continued his erratic tussle with the illusive figures. The treasurer
who was extremely busy that day, and a model of methodical precision in
business details, was thoroughly disgusted.

\xE2\x80\x9CWad,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou\xE2\x80\x99re in no condition to do business today. You\xE2\x80\x99re
drunk. Come in when you get sober and we will settle.\xE2\x80\x9D

The exaggerated dignity of the man \xE2\x80\x9Cunder the influence\xE2\x80\x9D immediately
asserted itself.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I\xE2\x80\x99m drunk and you\xE2\x80\x99re a d----d fool; I shall get over it and you
won\xE2\x80\x99t!\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

The small town which may perhaps chiefly by reason of geographical
location be the county seat, always livens up when the county court is
in session. There are always a few cases sufficiently unique to arouse
general interest. But there were real thrills at a certain court on one
occasion because of the approaching trial of a real genuine bank robber
who had been apprehended after he had committed a real crime. The
community seemed to some of the inhabitants to be getting thoroughly up
to date.


The Story of the Wily Bank Robber

The prisoner was an up-to-date crook without a doubt. He was a
professional and wanted elsewhere, but the court in question was
permitted to have the glory of \xE2\x80\x9Csending him over the road.\xE2\x80\x9D

The trial was a perfunctory affair, and aside from the testimony,
which was somewhat exciting in spots, there was nothing to provide any
special entertainment for spectators. The prisoner was sentenced for a
term of years, and remanded to the county jail to await the convenience
of the sheriff before being taken to the penitentiary in another town.

The session of court ended shortly after, and there was no further
cause for delay in placing the prisoner where he could put on the
stripes. Arrangements for transfer were made to take place on a certain
nearby day.

At the county jail it had been noted that the prisoner had been very
much cast down by his conviction. He was listless, showing little
desire for food and was extremely pale. Before the day set for his
removal it became a question whether he would long be able to make the
journey. It was therefore decided to remove him at once.

Accompanied by the sheriff, the prisoner, properly handcuffed, was
taken to the train, which after a few miles, was to pass through a
stretch of mountain timberland and on a heavy grade. As the train was
approaching this wilderness, the prisoner requested permission of the
sheriff to go to the wash room. His mildness and apparent natural
amiability together with his extraordinary weakness had aroused the
personal sympathy of the sheriff. So he promptly removed his handcuffs
and granted his desire, taking his own stand by the door, according
to custom. On the heavy grade the train naturally went slowly. The
prisoner had slipped the bolt as he went in and nothing further being
heard from him the sheriff rapped on the door. There was no response.
After a few such attempts to arouse the prisoner who had apparently
fainted from weakness, it was decided to force an entrance. As may be
naturally expected, the window was open and the prisoner was gone. The
train was halted and an immediate search was made and the alarm spread
far and wide. Nothing was ever heard of the prisoner again.

The mystery of the sudden extreme pallor and weakness was soon
afterwards solved. A search of the cell recently occupied by the
prisoner disclosed a couple of wads of so-called fine cut chewing
tobacco which those wise in criminal annals promptly connected with
the escape. The prisoner had bound these wads of tobacco under his
arm pits and it was the absorption of nicotine thus resulting which,
theoretically at least, had produced the symptoms which had so aroused
the sympathies of the sheriff.


The Legend of the Pine Tree

The fondness for litigation, especially among certain farmers in olden
times, became almost a monomania in some instances. For many years
there resided in a tumble-down house on a little farm, a man who with
his wife was perhaps as near an approach to poor mountain white as can
be found in the New England states. And yet the story had it that he
had at one time been a prosperous farmer in one of the most fertile
valleys of his state.

According to the legend this man and a neighbor became involved in a
dispute as to the possession of a certain large and lofty pine tree
situated on the boundary line of the two farms. The quarrel eventually
developed into a lawsuit which was continued from term to term by
well-known dilatory tactics of that period. Each of the parties in the
dispute had employed able legal counsel. Eventually both of the farmers
became bankrupt after exhausting their means in continuing the legal
struggle.


The Man Who Wanted to be \xE2\x80\x9CSociable\xE2\x80\x9D

In another instance a man possessed of the same mania for legal contest
had gradually seen his property absorbed by a capable lawyer. To him he
always referred his numerous disputes. When the aggressive litigant was
unable to pay money, the attorney would arrange for settlement by note.
The notes were transferred into a mortgage and finally the mortgage was
foreclosed.

At the general windup of affairs certain farm animals, which were a
part of the few visible assets remaining, were sold at auction. It
might be expected that the belligerent lover of lawsuits would have
been somewhat cast down under those circumstances. But he was game.

At one time, however, it became necessary for the auctioneer to
admonish the man who, although afflicted with an impediment of speech,
was seen to be in earnest conversation with a prospective bidder. It
was assumed by the auctioneer that he was giving out tips as to which
cows about to be sold were most desirable. In an aggressive tone,
calculated to be heard by all present, the auctioneer called out:

\xE2\x80\x9CLook here, Mr. Thomas! You keep your ideas about these cows to
yourself!\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man turned about to look at the auctioneer a moment, then with
a whimsical glance at the spectators stuttered out his response as
follows:

\xE2\x80\x9CD--d--dammit; can\xE2\x80\x99t a m--m--m--man be sociable?\xE2\x80\x9D




CHAPTER IX

SOME EXPERIENCES OF THE YANKEE TRAVELING SALESMAN


When it gradually dawned upon the country merchant that by dealing via
the mails with responsible wholesalers and jobbers of the cities, it
might not be necessary for him to spend a week or two several times
a year going to \xE2\x80\x9Cmarket,\xE2\x80\x9D it incidentally became apparent to the
wholesalers and jobbers in question that it might not be a bad idea to
visit the merchant in his own store and stimulate his ambition to try
out new goods of new styles and designs. The result was the development
of a very unique type, the traveling salesman or \xE2\x80\x9Cdrummer.\xE2\x80\x9D

Perhaps the most conspicuous of these tourists was the grocery
salesman. It was necessary for him to interview his trade about every
thirty days in order to keep designing rivals from stealing away
his customers. As there was a profit in the business, the number
of wholesale houses increased, and likewise the number of their
representatives. There gradually developed a very intense competition
for all kinds of trade.

The commercial traveler was necessarily a man of optimism and usually
endowed with a capacity to endure much physical fatigue. It was lively
work covering a good, fair sized territory every thirty days. Naturally
it became increasingly difficult for a novice to establish himself in
the face of such intense competition.


The Hopeful Young Beginner

A young man who had acquired roseate views of the possibilities of
making a fortune as a grocery salesman, started out to cover a new
route. Visiting a group of towns in a certain state, he found the
merchants were all exceptionally well supplied with everything he
himself had to offer, but with courage unabated he kept on, believing
that when he arrived at a nearby thriving town with several active
dealers, his luck would change.

Reaching this town on a late afternoon train, he hastened to the most
prosperous grocery store. The proprietor was just about to leave the
store to \xE2\x80\x9Cgo to supper.\xE2\x80\x9D He, however, paused to listen with a wearied
air while the young man introduced himself, explaining that he expected
to travel over that territory every four weeks from that time on and
hoped to be able to serve him. The merchant finally spoke:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou say you expect to come here once a month?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do,\xE2\x80\x9D was the hopeful reply.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said the merchant, with a twinkle in his eye. \xE2\x80\x9CI think you
ought to do well; there have only been thirteen grocery drummers here
today.\xE2\x80\x9D

The young man\xE2\x80\x99s enthusiasm was somewhat dampened.

       *       *       *       *       *

One of the bugbears of the New England traveling salesman who must
cover his route at frequent intervals, is the midwinter blizzard. It
often requires a good many card games to fill in the waits. These
episodes are not without amusing details, but one of these unwelcome
events developed little that was humorous.


The Sick Engineer in the Next Room

Late one winter afternoon, two salesmen left a nice comfortable
hotel in a little town because the path of duty led them to take a
narrow gauge road up into the mountains. It was getting dark, had
been snowing heavily all day and the wind was just beginning to take
part in the program, frisking the feathery snow, here and there, just
to show what an innocent thing a winter breeze can be. But when the
train had gotten out of the way from the valley town and was making
its laborious way up a steep grade into the mountains, the real force
of the wind began to be apparent. The cars would rock back and forth
on their narrow carriages, but as there was no record that they had
ever actually capsized, everything was cheerful enough in the smoking
car. After a few miles, progress began to be very slow, as drifts
had accumulated on the track. Finally a trainman came through and
said that \xE2\x80\x9CJim\xE2\x80\x9D was in mighty bad shape and he didn\xE2\x80\x99t know whether he
could stick it out to the end of the line or not. Certain questioning
brought out the fact that \xE2\x80\x9CJim\xE2\x80\x9D was the engineer who had a high fever
and was almost delirious. The air became colder and colder and the
wind increased. After several hours, however, the short run of thirty
miles was accomplished and the two travelers started for the hotel. It
developed, that the hotel was not ostensibly open for business, the
proprietor having become peeved at repeated searching parties working
in the interest of prohibition. One of the travelers, however, knew the
ropes and led the way around through the back kitchen where the low
browed graduate of a New York dive, who conducted the tavern, was found
and he reluctantly agreed to provide rooms, though they proved to be
absolutely without heat.

One of the travelers immediately went to bed, having the foresight to
take his fur coat with him for extra covering, but he did not sleep
well. The train crew had succeeded in helping the engineer through the
drifts to the hotel and established him in a room adjoining that of
the salesman. The rooms were communicating and although the door was
closed, there was a wide crack at the top. All night long, under the
faithful administrations of the local doctor, the heroic engineer who
had stuck to his post and pulled his train through under conditions
that would tax all the faculties of a well man, was battling for life.
He proved to have an acute form of pneumonia. The night finally passed
and the salesman was able to get out of town from which point he went
to headquarters in a neighboring city to report. A few days later,
being back on the job once more, he saw a funeral cortege coming from
the railroad station. They were carrying the body of the engineer.

       *       *       *       *       *

To the salesman who visits his trade at frequent intervals, life is
chiefly made up of customers and hotels. The amusing experiences which
every commercial man has are, however, chiefly associated with his
various hotel homes. To be able to establish oneself for the night
at a cozy hotel where it is allowable to call the clerk and the head
waitress by their first names, provides relief from the intense mental
concentration necessary in bringing various customers around to the
salesman\xE2\x80\x99s way of thinking.


What Happened in the Hotel Barber Shop

The salesman who takes frequent trips is, as before stated, eventually
in a position to call everyone in a hotel establishment by their first
names, the hotel barber being no exception. One such barber became very
widely known to travelers because of his genial qualities and quick
wit, as well as his efficiency in carrying on his trade. It was only
the occasional visitor to his shop who failed to call him \xE2\x80\x9CDan.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDan\xE2\x80\x9D not only enjoyed the popularity of the traveling fraternity,
but was regarded with high favor by the prominent citizens of the
town, most of whom were regular customers. While the atmosphere of the
barber shop was cheerful, \xE2\x80\x9CDan\xE2\x80\x9D was careful to make sure that there
was nothing in that same atmosphere that would be in any way offensive
to his more conservative clientele. With unusual skill he was able to
give his shop a somewhat clublike atmosphere which of course helped
business.

One day a very discordant element obtruded itself. A well-known, but
not greatly admired, local citizen familiarly known to the villagers as
\xE2\x80\x9CHen\xE2\x80\x9D was having one of his periodical drinking spells. Rambling about
in his customary aimless manner under such conditions, he suddenly
made his appearance in the shop. A bank president was in the chair and
another well-known citizen was \xE2\x80\x9Cnext.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDan\xE2\x80\x9D gave a quick glance at the intruder, who obviously had no
business purpose in coming there, and detecting his condition at once,
he told the inebriate man in bland but decisive terms that he better
move along. \xE2\x80\x9CHen\xE2\x80\x9D was not in a frame of mind to be reasoned with and
showed no intention of moving out. He addressed his conversation
indiscriminately to all who might be present, much to their annoyance.
But \xE2\x80\x9CDan\xE2\x80\x9D was equal to the emergency. Suddenly laying down his razor,
he stepped quickly to his overcoat which was hanging on a peg and
took from one of the pockets a leather pipe case. Wheeling about and
pointing the pipe case at this astonished intruder, he said:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou get out of here, quick; or I\xE2\x80\x99ll shoot you right in your tracks!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHen\xE2\x80\x9D was no hero, drunk or sober, and he fled in consternation to the
other end of the village.

       *       *       *       *       *

Visiting the country stores of New England in wintertime, often
provides startling contrasts in the way of hotels. The traveler who
spends Tuesday night at a thoroughly modern commercial hotel in a town
of 5000 inhabitants, can spend Wednesday night in a similar hotel, if
he is traveling in summer via auto. In winter, however, he may find it
difficult to arrange for these comforts.


The Salesman Who Was Given a \xE2\x80\x9CWarm Room\xE2\x80\x9D

A salesman for a western firm who enjoyed the comforts of life, was
quite disturbed one evening to find himself in a small mountain village
and destined to stay over night at an old-fashioned hotel. This
old-time tavern was one of the oldest buildings in that section of
the state and much the oldest of all the hotels of that region. It was
built of brick, with small windows and high window sills, the glass
being small panes of the Revolutionary period. The sleeping rooms were
but narrow cells leading off from a long, dark corridor.

The outdoor temperature was about 20 degrees below zero, and as this
hotel had no steam heat, each room being warmed separately, the
salesman made a very vigorous demand for a fire in his bedroom. He was
promptly assured by the landlord that he should have a fire and a warm
room.

Stopping at the hotel was a traveling troop of Indian performers, the
male members of which camped out in the old-time dance hall on the
second floor. The salesman, who had not slept very well the night
before, went to his room early. He found an old-fashioned box stove
which was just beginning to throw out a genial heat. He felt very well
satisfied with himself that he had made his demands known.

With the door closed, the temperature of the small room soon passed
the genial stage. It became intense. The salesman therefore hastened
to open the window, believing that a little 20 degrees below zero air
would just about balance the overtime efforts of the stove. He found
the lower part of the window sash so thoroughly fixed into a bed of
ice that it was immovable. He therefore concluded that if he opened
the door into the hall, it would make things about right. This he
accordingly did and went back to bed. He was just dozing over when he
heard a rustling at the door. He looked out into the dimly lighted hall
to see one of the \xE2\x80\x9Cbucks\xE2\x80\x9D belonging to the Indian encampment looking
curiously into his room. He therefore concluded that it would be wiser
to close the door, as his confidence in the absolute integrity of the
members of the troop was not of the Fenimore Cooper type.

Having closed the door, the salesman then attempted to go to sleep,
but it was impossible. He arose and opened the stove door and made a
careful study of the contents. He found a large green chunk of wood
well coaled over and apparently capable of sustaining an abundance of
heat during the night. A high pitcher sitting in an old-fashioned bowl
contained some water and the luxury loving traveler succeeded finally
in slackening the fire to such an extent that he was able to get
several hours sleep.

The hotel was of very considerable interest as a historical landmark,
but it can be taken for granted that the picturesque history of this
hostelry was not appreciated by the traveling salesman.

       *       *       *       *       *

Modern conditions prevail with the country hotels of northern New
England at present. Only a few winters ago, however, a salesman who
opened a window of his steam heated sleeping room for air and then woke
up to find the faucet in his room frozen, was promptly presented with
a bill for damages the next morning by the landlord. It may be said,
however, that this hotel is not typical. There are numerous country
inns throughout New England which are comfortable in the coldest days
in winter.


Story of the Itemized Expense Account

A veteran hardware salesman, named Ed Stone, made two trips a year
among his wide circle of customers. He was genial, efficient and
popular, and was regarded as a valuable asset by his employers. The
oldest member of the firm, quite well along in years, was very prone to
petty economies. Looking over some of the travel accounts of several
salesmen representing the firm, he came to the conclusion that it would
be well to have them itemize their expense accounts. As Ed happened
to be at the store, he promptly advised him of the new policy. The
salesman who knew the peculiarities of the old gentleman, assured him
that it would be perfectly satisfactory to him to make out a detailed
report.

Starting out the next week, about one of the first points to be reached
was a small city where Ed had always been tolerably sure of a big
order. The store was conducted by an old-time merchant who had been
gradually pushed into the background by his aggressive and far less
competent son. While there were whispers that the firm were heading in
the wrong direction, their credit was still excellent.

So to the young man of the firm, Ed extended the fraternal hand, but
soon found that \xE2\x80\x9CTommy,\xE2\x80\x9D the son, was not in a genial humor. Business
was very poor, he was told. They had plenty of goods and would skip
the usual spring order. Further parley seemed to promise no results,
\xE2\x80\x9CTommy\xE2\x80\x9D showing symptoms of irritability.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Ed, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m sorry you feel that way, but I cannot see any
reason why you should not come down to the hotel and have supper with
me tonight. Like enough we will find a couple of the boys there and can
have a game of whist.\xE2\x80\x9D

After some persuasion, \xE2\x80\x9CTommy\xE2\x80\x9D accepted the invitation, appearing at
the hotel soon after the store closed, where he enjoyed as sumptuous a
dinner as the ingenuity of Ed could devise. Later on they went to Ed\xE2\x80\x99s
room, but there is no occasion for any further details, as everything
which transpired can readily suggest itself to any normal imagination
by the item which appeared in Ed Stone\xE2\x80\x99s expense account for that day.

    \xE2\x80\x9CFebruary 26th

    To getting Tommy Wilson into a frame of mind so that he would
    order his usual spring bill of goods.... $20.00\xE2\x80\x9D

Shortly afterward Ed Stone\xE2\x80\x99s circumlocutions brought him near enough to
the main office so that he ran in over Sunday and handed his expense
report to the senior member of the firm. The latter looked it over with
great interest for a few seconds and then turned to Ed:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, Mr. Stone,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat does this Wilson item mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

Ed smiled.

\xE2\x80\x9CI think,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll have to leave that to your imagination.\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man, who was a good citizen and a church man in regular
standing, swallowed hard and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! Well! I guess you need not bother to itemize your expense
reports any more.\xE2\x80\x9D


\xE2\x80\x9CTwo Barrels\xE2\x80\x9D

A great asset to the traveling salesman is individuality, especially if
it is of the constructive type.

A bakery and confectionery firm had a star traveling salesman who
covered a wide range of territory. Somewhat advanced in years, he
gradually became afflicted with an impediment in his hearing.

There is often tragedy in some gradually developing infirmity like
deafness, but it did not prove necessary for the firm who employed
Henry S--to make any change. They were very well satisfied to let Henry
stay on the job year after year, until he became quite an old man.

Henry always could be depended upon to get orders. Of course his
success in quite a large measure was due to his friendly personality
which made him cordially received wherever he went.

There are tricks in all trades and Henry became famous for one which
caused many a smile, not only among the storekeepers, but the traveling
profession as well.

Whenever in doubt, because of defective hearing, Henry always assumed
that his customer was talking business. A star feature of his line was
a certain brand of homemade crackers.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t believe I need any crackers today, Henry,\xE2\x80\x9D said the
storekeeper, raising his voice.

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo barrels, did you say?\xE2\x80\x9D said Henry.

The merchant laughed and nodded his head. He knew he could get rid of
them sooner or later and Henry was a thoroughly good fellow.


The Old Man Who Was Inveigled Into a Poker Game

In a certain New England town, two hustling citizens bought an old
hotel which with certain renovations and alterations, soon became an
attractive resort for commercial men. And while new customers flocked
to the old hotel, the old rural patrons also proved loyal and the hotel
did a thriving business.

One evening three enterprising commercial men began looking about for a
fourth partner for the purpose of going into retirement for a little
tussle with the god of Chance; in other words, they were to play poker.
No one turning up to take the fourth place, their attention was called
to an elderly man with white hair and a long white beard, who seemed
to be quite active for his years and, more as a joke than anything
else, they invited him to take part in the game. The old gentleman in
question lived on a farm and came from a very rural district, therefore
according to the usual precedents, he should be expected to gasp with
horror at the prospect of being decoyed into a gambling game with three
thoroughly up-to-date young travelers. Somehow he did not seem to be
disturbed by what the game developed into soon after he had taken his
seat.

The traveling men were well supplied with expense money and as they had
naturally expected from his moderately prosperous appearance, the old
gentleman seemed also to have plenty of funds. The contest lasted far
beyond the time when the elderly gentleman with the long white whiskers
might be expected to retire to rest, but he did not seem to be visibly
affected by the late hours. The game finally terminated in time to
give the commercial men two or three hours of very necessary sleep,
after which they had their breakfast, negotiated various small loans
to secure expense money and went their several ways. The hotel porter,
naturally cognizant of everything that happened in the hotel, tersely
explained the entire matter in the following words:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy Lord! Say, do you know that old chap with the white whiskers? He
just cleaned those fellows out of every cent they had!\xE2\x80\x9D

To those who knew the \xE2\x80\x9Cold gentleman,\xE2\x80\x9D whose hair became snow white at
a little past thirty and who carried that same luxuriant white hair
until he was eighty years old, the above incident is but a glimpse of
his many sided characteristics. He could be as generous with those
who needed friendly sympathy as he could be merciless with those who
attempted to overreach him.




CHAPTER X

TRADITIONS OF THE RURAL CHURCH


The New England pioneers who penetrated the unbroken, trackless forests
searching for suitable locations for future homes and who spared no
physical effort in establishing these homes, would have regarded
with contempt, if not with horror, the present day tendencies toward
shorter and shorter hours of labor. For in their dictionary the term
\xE2\x80\x9Crecreation\xE2\x80\x9D was practically unknown.

No new settlement could be regarded as fairly established until it
possessed a schoolhouse and a church. Naturally this involved much
extra labor and personal sacrifice.

So the New England tourist of the present day is constantly finding
these little old-fashioned emblems of self-denial tucked away, not only
in small hamlets but at the cross roads. The influx of numerous people
of different foreign nationalities and of the different religions, has
in many instances left the churches a difficult problem, financial and
otherwise, to the limited number of communicants yet remaining of the
old New England stock.

Before so many of the younger generation became ambitious for city life
and left the home farms to pass into the hands of strangers, these
churches were very active centers of culture and uplift.

However, with human nature as it is, it could hardly be expected that
there should not be some trying incidents connected with the close
intimacies of the country congregation. The new pastor soon found that
each of his parishioners had a very distinct individuality which was
often calculated to jar upon other individualities of his flock. The
nerve strain incident to preserving harmonious relations under these
conditions was no doubt responsible in numerous instances for the
\xE2\x80\x9Cnervous dyspepsia\xE2\x80\x9D which has so frequently afflicted country ministers.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the early days when barter rather than cash was the chief means of
exchange, the parson\xE2\x80\x99s salary was necessarily small, at least in actual
cash. To make up to him what they were unable to deliver in the way
of real money, the pastor was made the subject of countless acts of
generosity in the form of loads of wood, potatoes, pork and various
other elements of family subsistence. However, the crowning act of
generosity on the part of parishioners was the annual Donation Party.


The Story of the \xE2\x80\x9CRaised\xE2\x80\x9D Biscuits

In a certain parish there was a clergyman whose family did not take
very kindly to these rural substitutes for real money. Probably the
minister\xE2\x80\x99s wife had \xE2\x80\x9Cseen better days\xE2\x80\x9D before she became the partner of
a struggling country pastor. And quite likely she may have expressed
her disapproval of the stingy characteristics of some in the parish in
the presence of her children.

The annual Donation Party at this parsonage was a great success in
point of numbers, but the donations themselves were rather small. Each
matron of the community was of course expected to furnish her share of
the refreshments. Probably there was not sufficient team work in the
\xE2\x80\x9CLadies\xE2\x80\x99 Aid Society.\xE2\x80\x9D At any rate, the pastor\xE2\x80\x99s wife found herself,
at the conclusion of the evening\xE2\x80\x99s festivities, in possession of an
extraordinarily large number of exceedingly durable \xE2\x80\x9Craised biscuits,\xE2\x80\x9D
the other donations being far below the proper standard.

It became necessary for the pastor and his wife to visit an adjoining
town the next day, their children being left behind. During the absence
of the parents there were developments which scandalized the entire
neighborhood and filled the pastor and his wife with horror.

Shortly after their parents went away the children got busy. The
residents of the neighborhood passing the parsonage during the day
noted with mingled amusement and indignation the fact that each one of
the wooden pickets surrounding the ample enclosure of the parsonage was
surmounted by a raised biscuit.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a very hot Sabbath, but the faithful residents of the parish
were practically all in attendance. The parson accepted even the most
extreme views of the tense theology of that period. Therefore the
faithful mothers of the congregation arose early in order that they
might prepare all the children of walking age and upwards to appear
in clean clothes and clean faces by the time the last bell stroke was
heard.


The Small Boy Who Scandalized the Congregation

In accordance with the custom of that period, there were no free pews,
except for the extremely poor. The owner of each of these sittings
after carefully packing his family away in the limited space available
for that purpose, closed the door of his pew.

As before stated, it was a very warm day and little \xE2\x80\x9CJabe,\xE2\x80\x9D who for
some family reason or other was at present living with his three maiden
aunts, came to church attired only in his gingham shirt and cotton
trousers. Jabe was not old enough to appreciate the solemnity of the
occasion and it was beyond his understanding how people could be so
foolish as to be willing to sit perfectly still for two mortal hours
in church. Therefore, when he found that his attendance at church
was inevitable that morning, he looked about to provide himself with
diversion for the long period of hateful inactivity. The maiden aunts
were very devout. They gave their entire attention to the parson.
Except to occasionally lay a restraining hand on the \xE2\x80\x9Cwiggling\xE2\x80\x9D urchin
who was stationed between them, they seemed to have forgotten him.

In the pew immediately behind little Jabe and his aunts, there were
several young girls. Even at this time it was often necessary to frown
upon the effervescent spirits of girls in their teens. It can therefore
be readily understood how horrified and scandalized were the \xE2\x80\x9Cpillars\xE2\x80\x9D
of the church, when in the midst of the service, one of these young
ladies squealed hysterically. The minister ceased his discourse and
one of the deacons hastily demanded an explanation, which even in that
austere congregation seemed to be not only satisfying but amusing.
Little Jabe on his way to church, loitering behind his faithful aunts,
had spied a small snake on the roadside, pounced upon it and tucked
it inside his little gingham shirt. When the pastor had got well along
in \xE2\x80\x9Cfifthly,\xE2\x80\x9D Jabe had taken the snake by the tail and allowed his
head to emerge from his shirt front with the above named disastrous
consequences to the dignity of the morning service.

       *       *       *       *       *

Without doubt the first essential for the success of the country pastor
is the diplomatic instinct. He may be lacking in many other ways,
and yet continue to retain the good will and support of his parish,
provided that he can get in intimate contact with his people without
wounding their peculiar sensibilities.


The \xE2\x80\x9CDriveling Idiot\xE2\x80\x9D

A well-known clergyman, who was extremely popular in several parishes,
tells with much delight, his experience with a certain amiable old lady
who received him very cordially one day when making pastoral visits.

This minister was a comparative newcomer in the community and had
never had an opportunity to really make the acquaintance of the
lady in question. The conversation covered the normal range of small
town subjects, the lady showing very considerable interest in the
minister and his prospects and becoming more and more affable as the
conversation continued.

Finally it became the proper thing for the minister to gracefully
withdraw, which he did despite the urgent protest of his hostess to
linger a little longer. As he was about to take his departure, she gave
him a most approving look and dismissed him with the following words:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am so glad we have had this little visit. I am sure we shall all
like you ever so much. Do you know you greatly remind me of the
minister who was here when my husband and I first went to housekeeping.
He died a driveling idiot.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

In a remote village there was located a clergyman who divided his
energies between two small parishes. Diplomacy was not his strong
point. Probably not one-third of his hearers were communicant members.
And under his austere ministrations, many who were fairly regular in
their attendance showed a marked reluctance to allow themselves to be
enrolled officially.

In consequence of this unwillingness to assume church responsibilities,
the pastor held very pessimistic views as to their probable future and
did not hesitate to make it fairly clear and definite when occasion
permitted.

A great opportunity came to him and it may be truthfully said that he
made the most of it.


The Love-Cracked Suicide

Away back in the hills there was a young man of nineteen or twenty who
had become greatly interested in a somewhat frivolous maiden of sixteen
years. Psychologists of the present would have probably pronounced
Jim\xE2\x80\x99s development as about equal to that of ten or twelve years. He was
distinctly defective mentally, but a good worker on the farm and of
generally amiable tendencies. Theology to him was as remote a topic as
Babylonian literature.

But Jim had very definite views as to this girl. He was infatuated to
the point of desperation.

The young lady in question considered it a great joke. One evening she
would be very bland and agreeable and the next time Jim appeared, she
would be very much the reverse. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the
details which are too familiar to most people to require explanation.
She was having a beautiful time tormenting poor Jim. One evening she
carried it a little too far and Jim left her convinced that life was
not worth living. Retiring to a lonely hilltop with a heavily loaded
shotgun, he departed this life with almost incredible rapidity.

This unfortunate event created a wide sensation. Overwhelmed with
remorse, the young lady could not sufficiently abase herself.
Therefore, when the funeral was held in the little country church, she
appeared first among the mourners, although there is not the slightest
probability that she would ever have married poor Jim had he lived to
continue his courtship.

Knowing Jim\xE2\x80\x99s amiable qualities, all of the community were sympathetic
except the pastor. To him this situation presented the opportunity of a
lifetime.

The keynote of the funeral discourse was soon made apparent by the text:

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Paul cried with a loud voice: Do thyself no harm.\xE2\x80\x9D

Whereupon the astonished congregation found that instead of having
gathered to hear words of sympathy for the family bereaved by the
insane act of a love-crazed youth, they were to hear words of
condemnation and vituperation with direful warnings of eternal misery.

The more intelligent people listened with disgust, while those who
seldom, if ever, entered the church, looked on with amusement. With
the completion of the services, the people gladly withdrew from the
ministerial presence and when safely outside, their general views were
summarized by the comments of the local cobbler.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, the parson certainly had it in for poor Jim; he held him out
over Tophet for about an hour and then kicked him over in!\xE2\x80\x9D


\xE2\x80\x9CThere is a Lion in the Way\xE2\x80\x9D

On a certain July Sabbath the afternoon service in the little church
seemed to drag. There had been a long morning service, and a session
of the Sunday school earlier in the day, so it perhaps may not seem
surprising that some of the congregation were seen to nod at times and
then with renewed effort, concentrate their attention upon the minister.

The pastor of the parish was greatly beloved for his personal
characteristics, but not greatly admired as a preacher. His oratorical
process consisted of slow, rambling talks in a low monotone
intermingled with occasional emphatic remarks in a very loud voice.

The breeze which had been coming through the open windows died away and
the congregation became more and more drowsy. The pastor, amiable and
considerate, was the last preacher in the world to resent somnolence on
the part of his audience.

The sermon progressed and the pastor\xE2\x80\x99s thought was being slowly and
laboriously laid before the few who were still awake. When he found
it consistent with his system of discourse, he often projected an
allegorical picture upon the mental processes of his hearers.

Suddenly raising his voice until it echoed and re-echoed throughout the
edifice, he shouted:

\xE2\x80\x9CBut there is a lion in the way!\xE2\x80\x9D

A rustle passed over the congregation and all the drowsy ones sat up,
some few looking around hurriedly in various directions but becoming
speedily reassured.

The fact that a combined circus and menagerie was advertised to exhibit
in a nearby town within a few days might possibly have had something to
do with the unexpected success of the pastor\xE2\x80\x99s allegory.

       *       *       *       *       *

The enrollment in a certain community church was relatively small
because of a diversity of the religious beliefs among the various
families. Those who did not belong to the faith represented by the
minister were indisposed at that period to accept membership in the
church, even if they might be fairly regular in their attendance and
assist in the church financially. Others, of course, were indifferent
altogether.


The Man Who Borrowed \xE2\x80\x9CArabian Nights\xE2\x80\x9D from a Christian Woman

A man, naturally bright, but of limited education, had an unusually
good excuse for not attending church. He had a very large family
which taxed all his energies to support, and was sadly lacking in
church-going apparel. One day, while at the house of a neighbor, he
asked the woman of the household, who was a conscientious church
worker, to loan him a book to read.

Thinking that this man might enjoy tales of the marvelous, the woman
loaned him a copy of an expurgated edition of \xE2\x80\x9CArabian Nights.\xE2\x80\x9D He took
the book away with him and kept it for some time.

Finally one evening he brought it back. When asked if he had read the
book through, he said he had read part of it, but it had troubled him.
Asked for a more definite explanation, he expressed himself as follows:

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cto tell the plain truth, I was shocked when I started
reading. I could not understand how any Christian woman could loan me
such, a pack of lies as there is in that book!\xE2\x80\x9D

All of which well illustrates the different standards of the Victorian
period as compared with those of the present day.

       *       *       *       *       *

The congregation of a certain New England church, especially the
feminine portion, were full of appreciation, admiration and sympathy
for one of the deacons.


The Woman Who Was Not Going to be a Pack Horse

This man wore a constant expression of submission and meekness. He
was an exemplary citizen in every respect and was faithful in his
attendance to the duties of his office.

There was a special reason why the women of the church so highly
approved of the deacon. It was reported that his wife was very
impatient with him.

Gradually there developed an atmosphere of coldness toward the wife,
more than counter-balanced by the sympathetic friendliness toward her
husband. This was somewhat irritating to the lady in question, who
so far as she knew had never transgressed any of the general laws of
society nor of the church. After a while the deacon\xE2\x80\x99s wife became very
unreconciled at the situation and from dwelling upon the matter she
became probably more irritable than a deacon\xE2\x80\x99s wife should be.

One day some unfortunate event led this woman to express herself more
freely to her husband than she had done for a long time. As usual he
accepted her remarks with docility and calmness.

The deacon went to his room and the wife went about her tasks in a
tumult of dissatisfaction with herself and the entire situation. She
recalled legends of the deacon\xE2\x80\x99s early life which indicated he was of
a very high temper. If he had only said something in self-defense, the
situation would be more bearable. Shortly afterward she had occasion
to go up stairs and as her felt slippers made little noise, she
approached the conjugal chamber unnoted. Hearing the sound of her
husband\xE2\x80\x99s voice, she stopped at the nearly closed door to listen.

The deacon was engaged in prayer and she listened to hear him express
his thanks that although a wilful, perverse person, he had been
permitted to have a cross to bear, or rather a thorn in the flesh
in the form of his wife, in consequence of which he could develop
patience, endurance and the various divine virtues.

The deacon\xE2\x80\x99s wife listened to the foregoing in amazement and then it
all dawned upon her. Pushing open the door and quickly confronting her
astonished husband, she said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI understand it all now. Perhaps you think I am going to be a pack
horse to carry you to Heaven, but you will find out differently.\xE2\x80\x9D

The legend says that the subsequent amiability and angelic sweetness
of the wife eventually caused the deacon to appear almost irascible at
times.

Among the regular attendants at a little country church, were a rather
attractive, enterprising young lady and a very bashful young man.


The Enterprising Deacon Who Proposed at the Grave

As may often be observed, under such circumstances, the vivacious young
lady possessed great attractiveness in the eyes of the young man, but
held back by his natural diffidence, he failed to make his admiration
definitely known to the girl. She was not lacking in other admirers and
so it happened that when the young man in question finally developed
sufficient courage to ask the young lady to marry him, he was informed
in the most gracious manner that while she had always esteemed him
highly as a friend and might have even had a greater interest in him, a
more self-confident rival had secured her promise to marry him.

The young man was naturally very much cast down. The apparent admission
on the young lady\xE2\x80\x99s part that his answer might have been different had
he been a little more prompt in making his wishes known, was especially
depressing to him.

A few years passed and the young woman, who had apparently lived
happily with her husband, was unfortunately left a widow. Her former
admirer decided that he would not be backward this time, but just
as soon as any decent period had passed, he would resume paying his
addresses and thereby forestall any of the other eligibles of the
community. He called upon the young woman and was graciously received
and thus encouraged proceeded to carry on his courtship with a vigor
and enthusiasm that to his own highly developed sense of the fitness of
things, seemed to border upon impropriety. Finally he brought matters
to a climax by again offering his hand and fortune to the blooming
widow. Greatly to his chagrin he was informed, as before, that she was
promised to another man.

This was hard luck indeed and the disappointed wooer was almost
inclined to resort to that quite common rural expedient and marry some
other girl \xE2\x80\x9Cout of spite.\xE2\x80\x9D But somehow this did not seem to square with
his conscientious scruples and in fact there was no other girl about
who seemed to attract him. It was a depressing situation indeed.

But, as sometimes happens, she who had been maid, wife, widow and again
wife, once more became a widow. The twice disappointed devotee decided
this time there would be no delays due to a fantastic sense of what was
suitable and proper.

Accordingly the very next evening he called to see the doubly bereaved
woman. She met him very cordially and his hopes arose high. Feeling
that he had already made his regard for her sufficiently clear so that
there need be no time lost in preliminaries, he gave but a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99
consideration to discussing the weather and other common topics before
proceeding to the matter at hand. He asked her to marry him.

The young woman gazed at him sympathetically a moment and then murmured:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am so sorry but I am already engaged; Deacon Harris proposed at the
grave!\xE2\x80\x9D




CHAPTER XI

TALES OF RURAL THRIFT


There are probably few better schools for the development of thrift
than the small New England farm, which although necessarily limited
in its capacity to produce an income, still requires a considerable
investment in necessary equipment. Those courageous, hard working
couples who bring up a family upon one of these small homesteads, find
it exceedingly hard to make ends meet and may quite likely often find
themselves at the end of the year in the state of mind shown by the
humble tiller of a Vermont farm who when asked what kind of a season he
had had, replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot say that we have made any money this year, but we have got
considerable growth on the young ones.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Old Friend and the Load of Hay

For many years a family had subsisted upon a small farm which was a
source of profit chiefly to a money lender some fifteen miles distant
and made secure by means of a very energetic mortgage. It mattered not
what the family necessities might be, provision must always be made on
the first day of April for the payment of the interest.

One April first, when \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Aaron\xE2\x80\x9D had traveled the fifteen miles
laboriously through the mud to make his annual payment, he seemed to
the holder of the mortgage to be somewhat depressed. As he was normally
a very cheerful man, the money lender asked him how things were going.
He was informed that \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Aaron\xE2\x80\x9D was exceedingly short of hay with
which to feed his stock until the grass in his pasture had made
sufficient start to justify his turning his cattle out to seek their
own living.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! well! Uncle Aaron,\xE2\x80\x9D was the reply. \xE2\x80\x9CI have a whole barn full of
hay at my farm up the Branch and you can take your horse and wagon, go
up there and get a load for your cattle and it won\xE2\x80\x99t cost you a cent.\xE2\x80\x9D

Uncle Aaron made his way homeward with a light heart. To be sure the
roads were in a fearful state, but his old mare was faithful and
reliable and he felt sure she could make the journey and take home a
pretty fair load of hay for his lean and always expectant cows.

A couple of days later with his horse and hay wagon he made the
journey, securing as much hay as he thought his horse could get home
with over the muddy roads. Apparently Uncle Aaron overestimated the
old mare\xE2\x80\x99s capacity, as when he was yet six or eight miles from home
she seemed to have lost all courage. He could hardly get her along the
road. Finally he remembered that at a farm a short distance ahead,
there lived an acquaintance of his who would probably be glad to put
him up for the night. He succeeded in persuading his reluctant horse to
cover the remaining distance and turning into the farm road observed
his old friend looking at him curiously, but who quickly approached and
welcomed him gladly.

\xE2\x80\x9CJust drive into the barnyard,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cand put your horse in a
stall, give her some supper and then we will go in the house. My wife
will be glad to make your acquaintance.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was indeed a haven of rest for Uncle Aaron. With the old mare well
fed and furnished with a comfortable bed of straw to sleep on, as his
friend had plenty of straw, although he admitted being very short of
hay, Uncle Aaron accepted gladly the hospitality of his friend\xE2\x80\x99s wife
who served an excellent supper. Such cordiality was really delightful
after so weary a day.

The evening passed in reminiscences of boyhood days, and the occasion
was enlivened by several pitchers of cider which in turn recalled jolly
old songs in which \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Aaron\xE2\x80\x9D and his host joined with zest. It was
a late hour before the old friends retired to rest.

Uncle Aaron slept soundly and late. He was awakened to hear with horror
the clock striking nine. Breakfast must have been over at least two
hours, if not more. Leaping from the bed, Uncle Aaron hastily proceeded
to dress, but his attention was called to a chamber window by the
bellowing of cattle. Looking out he saw his host halfway across the
field engaged in some farming task, while a large herd of cattle were
in the barnyard eagerly consuming what seemed to be about the last
of his load of hay. Hastening from the house and chasing the cattle
back into the meadow, where they had evidently been eagerly searching
for an occasional bite of dead grass, Uncle Aaron accepted a late
breakfast with numerous apologies to his hostess, harnessed his horse
and dejectedly turned his way homeward. The load which the old mare had
occasion to haul over the still sticky roads, did not seem to be much
of an embarrassment the rest of the way home.

The sad feature of this melancholy tale, to Uncle Aaron, was the ever
present doubt as to the real good intentions of his old friend in
turning his hungry cows into the meadow that morning and leaving the
gateway insecurely fastened.

       *       *       *       *       *

The ambitious proprietor of a small farm is naturally somewhat
perturbed when winter finds him with insufficient forage for his stock.
It means that he must go to the expense of buying supplies from his
more fortunate neighbors, or that he must sell some of his cattle at a
sacrifice.


The Man Who Worked a Confidence Game on His Cows

The owner of a little mountain farm found himself as winter approached
with a shortage of hay, but more dry straw than usual. The question
therefore was how to enthuse his cattle with the idea of making one
good, substantial meal per day of the straw. It should be understood
incidentally that the grain had been threshed out of this straw,
leaving just the residue, which from the standpoint of the average
experienced bovine citizen was exceedingly unpalatable.

The experiment was tried of feeding straw to the cattle in the manger
in the way hay was fed, but with very unsatisfactory results. The cows
nosed over the straw with badly concealed disgust. When it became
necessary to feed hay, practically all the straw had to be removed. It
was a discouraging situation but Yankee ingenuity, which has so often
stood the test, did not fail in this instance.

Taking into careful consideration the exceedingly complex psychology
(?) of the average cow, the owner had a very bright idea. He hastily
pitched a large quantity of straw out into the barnyard where the
cattle went out to drink, making as high a pile of it as possible; this
he surrounded with a rickety fence.

The next day, at the normal time for the straw ration, the cattle were
turned into the yard, and gazed curiously at the straw pile. Watching
at some distance, the farmer saw one or two cows approach the stack and
thrusting their heads through the ramshackle fence, nibble cautiously
at the straw. The owner promptly rushed into the yard and chased the
cattle away.

Again the farmer watchfully waited, noting with gleeful enthusiasm the
marked change in the attitude of his cattle toward the straw. That
which had been scorned by them when fed as a legitimate ration, now
seemed to assume new and seductive attractions.

He again drove them away and went to his house for the noonday
meal. When he returned an hour or two later the temporary fence was
completely demolished, while the unusual abdominal distention of his
flock of cows gave abundant evidence of the success of his experiment.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are few legends of unusual thrift which come down out of the past
involving the medical profession. The country doctor has usually worked
hard, gone without sleep, trusted patients to whom no one else would
think of giving credit, and died poor.


\xE2\x80\x9CStew \xE2\x80\x99Er Down\xE2\x80\x9D

There were exceptions, however. A doctor who had for many years enjoyed
a fairly lucrative practice and who had shown unusual efficiency
in holding his expenses at a low figure, gradually found himself
handicapped by the infirmities of age with a naturally diminishing
professional income.

Although the old doctor was in affluent circumstances for that period,
it was very depressing to him not to be able to lay aside the usual
amount each year. He accordingly resorted to the extremes of economy.
The doctor lived alone except for a housekeeper, and having had a
misunderstanding with her, found himself left entirely to his own
devices. He accordingly engaged a half-grown boy to come and stay with
him and \xE2\x80\x9Cdo chores for his board.\xE2\x80\x9D

The boy did not find the environment especially exhilarating. The old
man was very irascible and hard to please. Furthermore his menu was
rather too simple to meet the requirements of a growing boy.

One evening returning from school, the young man hustled to do his
outdoor tasks in order to prepare for an early supper. He had even
more than his normally excellent appetite. In fact he was practically
famished. He hoped therefore that the old doctor would give
instructions for a tolerably elaborate meal.

But he was greatly disappointed. Seating himself near the kitchen
range, the old doctor who commonly held his cane in his hand, even when
sitting in his easy chair, testily gave instructions to the boy to
make a hasty pudding, prepared of course by sifting fine cornmeal into
a kettle of boiling hot water until the right admixture is made, and
then allowing it to cook for a short time.

According to the instructions, the youngster soon had the kettle
boiling and brought forward an ample supply of the cornmeal, the old
man watching every movement. Taking spoonfuls of the meal in one hand,
he stirred vigorously with the other, meantime sifting in the meal. In
his eagerness to prepare a sufficient quantity of the food to satisfy
his youthful craving, the boy had put an unusual amount of water in the
kettle. But when he had sifted in about half enough meal to produce the
requisite combination with the water, he was abruptly brought to a halt
by the old doctor.

\xE2\x80\x9CHold on there, boy!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CYou have enough meal in there. Stew \xE2\x80\x99er
down.\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man\xE2\x80\x99s word was law and there was nothing for the youngster to
do but to speed up the fire and stir the contents of the kettle until
the evaporation of the superfluous water had brought the food mixture
to the right consistency.

The boy decided that in the interest of self-preservation he had better
hunt for a new job.


\xE2\x80\x9CNever Mind, I Can Cut It\xE2\x80\x9D

Probably no more elaborate form of thrift has ever been carried out
than that of the old-time widow of small fortune and the determination
to live on her income. One of this type of widows succeeded in making
herself a social leader among a considerable circle of women who were
in much more comfortable circumstances financially. The airs and graces
of this old lady were not looked upon with special admiration by the
men of the community, but when an exceedingly amiable married woman of
the neighborhood was invited with her husband to have supper with the
widow, she prevailed upon her reluctant husband to go with her.

They were received cordially by the hostess who gave most gracious
attention to the husband. He was not especially responsive and his wife
looked on with considerable anxiety lest he should somehow allow his
disapproval of the widow to show out in the conversation.

Everything went smoothly, however, and the amiable wife began to feel
quite at ease. Called to the dining room, the table was found to be
set out in very attractive style and lavishly supplied with everything
except things to eat. The food exhibit was exceedingly meager.

They took their seats and the old gentleman gruffly replied to the
prattle of the widow and seemed to be making a pretense of enjoying his
meal.

Finally, however, that occurred which the wife had feared, and she felt
disgraced for life.

As the final artistic touch of the meal, the widow turned to the pie
which was apparently destined for dessert, cut it with great precision
exactly through the center, next dividing one of the halves into three
exactly equal parts. She then passed the pie to the amiable wife
aforesaid, who removed one of the geometrical portions with the grace
and ease customary on such occasions. The widow then passed the pie to
the husband.

Perhaps the old man was actually in that state of undernourishment
which produces such dissatisfaction in the masculine mind; perhaps he
was inspired by a sardonic sense of humor. What he did was to reach out
and take the half pie yet uncut and remove it to his plate. His wife
looked on with horror.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, papa,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat part of the pie is not cut.\xE2\x80\x9D

The old man smiled at her grimly.

\xE2\x80\x9CNever mind,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CI can cut it.\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

The impression should not be acquired that New England thrift and
stinginess are synonymous. A person can be very economical and still be
generous and considerate.


The Empty Flour Barrel

A young married woman, whose husband was not regarded as a very good
\xE2\x80\x9Cprovider\xE2\x80\x9D and who had been housekeeping a year or two, was quite
flattered one afternoon at receiving calls by two estimable old ladies
of the neighborhood. It may be taken for granted that they knew pretty
nearly all the facts regarding the young couple in question. And their
disapproval of the husband was about equally balanced by their sympathy
for the wife.

After devoting an hour or two to conversation with her guests, the
young housekeeper excused herself in order that she might prepare the
five o\xE2\x80\x99clock supper. Styles of entertainment naturally change according
to the times, but at that period no farm supper table with guests
present would be considered as properly spread without an abundant
supply of hot soda biscuits which would be made more palatable by
serving some kind of fruit sauce.

Shortly after the young hostess had set about her task of preparing
supper, a pounding was heard in the kitchen. The two old ladies looked
at each other significantly. The pounding continued. The hollow sound
could suggest but one thing. The housewife was making a desperate
effort to gather up enough flour from a nearly empty barrel to make the
biscuits _de rigeur_ for supper.

The old ladies became more and more uneasy and the conversation died
away. Finally one of them arose.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know, I\xE2\x80\x99m going home! It doesn\xE2\x80\x99t seem to me as though I could
swallow a mouthful of one of those biscuits. That poor thing doesn\xE2\x80\x99t
have half enough to eat!\xE2\x80\x9D

While the other lady was hesitating, the hostess re-entered the room.
She of the uneasy conscience had already put on her wrap. The hostess
protested but with no results. Her decision being unalterable, the
other guest decided that it would be more diplomatic for her to make
an excuse also. And the ladies departed to their homes, each of them
more disgusted with Jake\xE2\x80\x99s improvidence than before they had apparently
encountered the direct evidence that his poor wife must be going hungry.

This was many years ago and probably not even millionaires now buy
their flour in barrels. But just because poor \xE2\x80\x9CJake\xE2\x80\x9D had been a little
slow about finding the wherewithal to lay in perhaps a year\xE2\x80\x99s stock of
flour for himself and wife, in one package, his wife\xE2\x80\x99s social status
received a serious jolt.

       *       *       *       *       *

Under the strictly home rule township system of the New England states,
only the large towns have their own resorts for the \xE2\x80\x9Cdown-and-outs\xE2\x80\x9D
known as \xE2\x80\x9Cpoor farms.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Town Pauper Who Made an Epigram

The small towns have from the most remote days generally arranged to
have the chronic town pauper boarded out in some family. Naturally
people in comfortable circumstances are not likely to furnish
entertainment for these unfortunates, who are generally farmed out by
the year in homes where the very moderate compensation for board would
be of financial assistance in meeting the year\xE2\x80\x99s expenses.

\xE2\x80\x9CUncle Hiram\xE2\x80\x9D had recently been transferred to the care of a family
which was not noted as given to a luxurious menu. There was no doubt
sufficient food, but it was very plain and \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Hiram\xE2\x80\x9D was naturally
somewhat of an epicure.

One day he appeared at the residence of the poor master and seemed to
be more dejected than usual. Suspecting that something was wrong, the
official began to ask questions.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Uncle Hiram, how are you getting along at your new home?\xE2\x80\x9D

Uncle Hiram was rather non-committal in his reply, seemingly reluctant
to make complaints, but after some urging he proceeded to make his
ideas clear in the following long remembered statement.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Thomas\xE2\x80\x99s folks are very good folks; but they have everything ter
buyee; and nothin\xE2\x80\x99 ter buy it with.\xE2\x80\x9D

As there was no evidence that Uncle Hiram did not fare as well in the
menu as the rest of the family, it was not considered necessary to try
and hunt him up a new boarding place.


The Conscientious Neighbor Who Ran An Account

It is a common belief that excessive thrift is a continual temptation
to dishonesty, but such is not necessarily the case. Perhaps there is
no more marked example of that exactitude in business transactions
which so frequently leads to the charge of stinginess than the instance
recorded of the obliging man who was asked by his neighbor to kindly
extend a little helpful supervision over the efforts of his young boys
to carry on the farm during his own necessary absence for a few weeks.
He offered to pay liberally for all the time required in carrying out
this plan.

The man cheerfully consented to do all he could for the youngsters
while their father was away.

The boys being carefully instructed as to their duties in his absence,
the father started on his journey well content that everything would
be all right. On his return he found that all had worked out as he had
expected.

The farm business had gone smoothly and when the obliging neighbor
presented his bill, carefully itemized, it was promptly paid and with
much pleasure.

The bill was carefully preserved as a souvenir for many years. It
comprised a considerable number of items, each representing some small
service for which the charge was accordingly trivial. Of course it is
impossible, and neither is it desirable, to go into details regarding
this bill, but one item may give a clue as to the conscientious,
methodical and business-like habits of the man who presented it.

That which has appeared heretofore in this chapter illustrates the
various phases of the habitual economy which has made the Scotch, the
New Englanders and other nationalities take so leading a place in
modern civilization. But there is another instance of the economical
instinct which stands out in very unpleasant contrast with the
foregoing.


The Thrifty Man Who \xE2\x80\x9CSwore Off\xE2\x80\x9D Using Tobacco

A well-to-do farmer had reached quite an advanced age and had been
recently left alone by the death of his wife. He had no children and no
obvious reason for denying himself anything within reason that would
help to allay his natural loneliness. But such a hold had frugal habits
taken upon him that one December he resolved that on January first he
would discontinue for all time his one indulgence, _viz._, \xE2\x80\x9Cfine cut\xE2\x80\x9D
tobacco, utilized in the manner made famous and conspicuous by many
eminent Americans during the preceding century.

Accordingly, having reached this decision, this model citizen began to
plan ahead. He found that his supply of \xE2\x80\x9Cfine cut\xE2\x80\x9D was in considerable
excess of his normal requirements. He therefore speeded up the matter
somewhat by increasing his daily allowance. But when the thirty-first
day of December arrived, he found himself with several days\xE2\x80\x99 supply on
hand.

There were acquaintances who would on request have cheerfully obliged
him by taking over his reserve stock. But this plan made no appeal. He
resolved to sit up until midnight, if necessary, and consume the last
of that \xE2\x80\x9Cfine cut\xE2\x80\x9D himself.

He carried out his plans according to program. But even his thoroughly
seasoned physique rebelled. The next day he was seriously ill. And his
funeral took place a week or two later.




CHAPTER XII

CHEERFUL TALES OF NEIGHBORLY INTERCOURSE


The impression may be easily acquired by the reader that the collector
of these authentic reminiscences is inclined to look with favor upon
those whose personalities are exhibited in these pages. Such an
impression is probably correct as it is not human nature to comment too
sarcastically upon that which adds to the joy of life.

In the average conservative rural neighborhood of New England, it is
regarded as excellent policy to cultivate the semblance of cordiality
in neighborly associations with special regard for humorous intercourse
whenever possible because people of even more than average human
frailty may have occasion to do kindly acts. Therefore, it is seldom
that neighborhood friction becomes openly demonstrative.

The boy or girl who has been raised in an atmosphere of forbearance and
who has been taught to avoid any outward display of personal dislike,
has acquired a very useful lesson. This may explain to a certain
extent the ability of the transplanted Yankee to avoid antagonisms in
neighborhoods in which there may be, generally speaking, less personal
restraint.


\xE2\x80\x9CAm I Ben Jackson, or Am I Not?\xE2\x80\x9D

It would have been perhaps natural for a certain Ben Jackson to have
resented what happened to him one sultry afternoon, but so far as
the record shows, if he had any such feeling he kept it carefully to
himself.

Ben Jackson had been to town a few miles away with a load which he
delivered with a yoke of oxen attached to a primitive cart of earlier
days. At that time it was but the most natural thing in the world that
there should have been included in Ben\xE2\x80\x99s purchases at the country
store, a bottle of rum. It must not be understood by this that Ben was
an intemperate man, for such was not the case. Like nearly everybody
else of that era, including deacons, clergymen, as well as Indians, he
considered that his health and that of his family required that they
have \xE2\x80\x9Csomething in the house\xE2\x80\x9D at all times.

On his way home with an empty cart and a docile pair of oxen, progress
was necessarily slow. A man who rises at three or four o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the
morning in order to put in a fair day\xE2\x80\x99s work before nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the
evening, has an excuse for becoming drowsy at times of inaction. Ben
had sampled the rum, found it good and tried it again, after which,
knowing that his oxen would probably find their way through the coming
strip of woodland without any guidance from himself, he stretched out
upon the cart and was soon fast asleep.

In the meantime the oxen had leisurely picked their way through the
woods until they came to a little opening at one side of the road where
there was some green grass. Having no one to restrain their movements,
they turned away from the road and began to refresh themselves. Just
about that time two young men came along who knew Ben very well and who
promptly grasped the situation. The little opening at the roadside was
rather rough ground and they could easily picture the oxen tipping the
cart to such an angle that Ben would roll off and possibly be injured.
It was therefore but a naturally kind act for them to guide the oxen
safely into a little arbor, release them from the cart and leave their
friend to enjoy his nap in safety. Incidentally they decided to sit
down in nearby obscurity and watch developments.

Ben\xE2\x80\x99s nap lasted for considerable time. But finally a swarm of
mosquitoes aroused him to semi-consciousness. He was surrounded by
trees and the entire scene was vague and unfamiliar. It seemed to him
that it must all be a dream. He began to talk and his kind friends,
before mentioned, listened eagerly.

\xE2\x80\x9CAm I Ben Jackson, or am I not? If I am Ben Jackson, I have lost a yoke
of oxen. If I am not Ben Jackson, I have found a cart.\xE2\x80\x9D

It can be easily understood that the friends in ambush soon reassured
Ben as to his identity. Just how much of the rum was left when he
finally arrived home does not appear in the record.

It will be noted that in this instance a practical joke was played
upon an unsuspecting citizen which placed him in a ridiculous light.
However, if the same practical joke had resulted in anything like
personal injury or damage to property, it would have been met with
local disgust or indignation, all of which indicates merely inherent
common sense.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the more leisurely days it was the custom that friends or neighbors
meeting while driving on the highway, would stop their teams and have
a little chat in the roadway. An exchange of jovial banter under such
conditions was not only frequent but expected. As an example there was
the chance meeting between Mr. Peck and Mr. Wells.


\xE2\x80\x9CThe Farther You Go the Better They Are\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Peck, who had recently removed from his native town some dozen
miles away, was returning to his new home from a brief visit to
his former town and met Mr. Wells, an old neighbor, in the highway.
Being congenial acquaintances, there naturally followed a general
conversation in which Mr. Peck inquired as to the well-being of various
mutual friends. There was much for Mr. Wells to tell, and Mr. Peck
enjoyed getting all the news from his old neighborhood. It required
several minutes for Mr. Wells to lay before Mr. Peck these numerous
details. Just about this time a heavy team approached nearer and nearer
and it was necessary, in view of the narrowness of the road, for these
old friends to separate. As Mr. Wells started up his horse to move
along, he remarked:

\xE2\x80\x9CThere are some mighty fine people in our old town.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Peck, \xE2\x80\x9Cand the farther you go the better they are.\xE2\x80\x9D

The personal application of Mr. Peck\xE2\x80\x99s remark will be appreciated when
it is explained that Mr. Wells lived on the very first farm across the
boundary line in the town under discussion.

In these degenerate gasoline days, there is less opportunity for such
friendly exchanges of left-handed compliments. When the horse was
the chief mode of conveyance, the frequent watering trough afforded
occasional chances for the circulation of the perennial Yankee jokes.


\xE2\x80\x9CSay, Put the Doctor Ahead\xE2\x80\x9D

A man returning to his farm from a visit to the grocery store, in
waiting to give his horse a drink, fell in behind an unusual collection
of vehicles. At the head of the line with his horse\xE2\x80\x99s nose in the
trough, was a well-known undertaker. Directly behind, waiting for
his turn was a veteran dealer in tomb-stones. And next in line was
the village doctor. The man in the rear, who knew all the parties
concerned, could not resist the opportunity to make a suggestion.

\xE2\x80\x9CSay,\xE2\x80\x9D he called in loud tones to those in front. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99ve got this
procession dead wrong; you ought to put the doctor ahead!\xE2\x80\x9D

All this is but a part of the record of the past. The actors have all
passed on, but there are many more recent echoes of amusing happenings
along the country roads.


The Scrambled Eggs in the Highway

At the foot of a long hill, near the outskirts of a certain busy town,
the middle of the snowy road for a protracted period of winter cold,
presented the appearance of well scrambled eggs. In reality it was not
exactly an optical delusion either. A well-known farmer, who lived
considerably back in the hill country, started out one \xE2\x80\x98day in his
old-fashioned \xE2\x80\x9Cpung\xE2\x80\x9D sleigh to deliver to a local grocery store two
or three weeks\xE2\x80\x99 accumulation of fresh laid eggs. These were carefully
packed in a receptacle with a loose cover. Just as he was reaching the
foot of the hill near the railroad, a train suddenly darted into view
and while his horse was old enough to have become steady, he had never
become reconciled to the arrogant actions of a locomotive. He gave a
quick leap and in spite of the best efforts of his driver, succeeded
in dumping the contents of the sleigh into the middle of the road. The
slaughter of eggs was practically complete.

The conventional thing to say would be that the driver, who soon
controlled his horse, returned to his home a sadly disappointed man.
But this would in reality be a misstatement. The spectacle of thirteen
dozen eggs totally wrecked in the middle of the highway and the
prospective wonderment of passersby so stimulated the farmer\xE2\x80\x99s Irish
sense of humor, that he told the story with great delight to everyone
whom he could induce to listen to him. Naturally his attitude regarding
this untoward event might have been somewhat different had he been in
circumstances which made the loss of the eggs a matter of any real
importance.

       *       *       *       *       *

The occasional wrecked vehicle which may be seen by the roadside in
country districts is more likely in these days to be a gasoline buggy
than one drawn by horses. But one midsummer day not long ago, travelers
along a back country road observed with much curiosity what remained
of an old time buggy which indicated a bad case of misunderstanding
between some horse and its driver. Those who found out the facts were
considerably amused.


The Story of the Rebellious Horse

A prominent farmer in the neighborhood had somewhere acquired a horse
whose disposition had become permanently sour. This horse was not
satisfied to work eight hours a day, or six hours, or in fact to do any
work at all. She was on a permanent strike and inclined to sabotage.
Her owner therefore decided that there was no use in bothering any
longer and announced his intention of having the horse killed.

About a half mile away there was a young man who believed that he
possessed certain hypnotic powers, at least in the matter of horses. He
told the owner of the striker aforesaid that it was a shame to close
out as good a horse as that, whereupon the owner promptly made him
a present of the animal. The young man led the horse home and made
elaborate plans for a process of education and benevolent philanthropy
which would cause the rebellious equine to see things in an entirely
different light.

As the eccentric horse had a record of becoming too handy with her
heels, it was desirable to proceed with caution.

The early results of the ensuing course of treatment were encouraging.
The horse seemed to respond to the humane methods of the experimenter.
Every evening the horse received a lesson and finally was harnessed
and driven short distances on the highway. His new owner, however,
seemed to prefer seclusion for his experiments. At last he began to be
convinced that the horse\xE2\x80\x99s nature was entirely changed. He was elated
with the success of his efforts.

Finally he decided that the time was near when he could exhibit his new
possession by daylight. He looked forward with much anticipation to the
admiration with which his efforts would be regarded by all the young
men of his acquaintance.

Before making this public show of his horse, he concluded to give it
one more tryout. He had always driven with a stiff check rein which
held the horse\xE2\x80\x99s head very high. When a horse\xE2\x80\x99s heels go up, its head
goes down. After making a little detour on a comparatively level road,
he turned on to a stretch of road which led up a hill. When he had
nearly reached the top it occurred to him that it was a little hard on
the now reformed horse to make her climb where it was so steep with the
head held up so high. He stopped the animal, got out of the buggy and
unhooked the check rein. He resumed his seat in the buggy, gathered up
the reins and started the horse again. Holding the reins very firmly
he was, for a minute or two, able to keep the animal\xE2\x80\x99s head in nearly
the desired position. Then followed a struggle between the horse and
the driver which resulted finally in the horse depressing its head to
the right angle, after which there was a most remarkable bombardment
of rapidly moving heels which, according to the driver\xE2\x80\x99s subsequent
report, established a new record over anything he had ever yet heard
of. The horse trainer fortunately succeeded in escaping uninjured from
the vehicle, got the horse by the head, unfastened the straps, and ran
what was left of the wagon up on to the bank at the roadside, from
which point he led his horse home, thankful that the shades of evening
were such as to make his movements obscure. The horse regeneration
experiment was a failure.

       *       *       *       *       *

While the more remote highways of New England are anything but a joy
during certain months, they become more attractive as the fields and
woodlands assume their summer hues.


What Happened to the Junk Man

One of the first signs of well developed spring in the farming sections
is the appearance of the traveling junk man.

The conventional outfit required for this branch of commerce is a
substantial wagon of medium size and a horse of sufficient age and
discretion to stand patiently by the roadside while the driver dickers
for old metals, wornout rubber footgear and the surplus burlap grain
bags which are apt to accumulate on the average dairy farm. It is
probable that the real, conscientious traveling tourist of this variety
does not allow himself to profiteer to a greater extent than say 4000
per cent. As might be expected, these travelers are not regarded with
much enthusiasm, although they are allowed to carry away that which
otherwise would be a total waste.

One of these aggressively industrious people was making his rounds one
day and left his team in front of a farmhouse While he interviewed
the proprietor. Just at this point some men were repairing the road.
Although his negotiations occupied several minutes, he returned empty
handed, climbed into his wagon and moved along. Shortly afterward
he turned off the main thoroughfare on to a side road which soon
became quite steep. His faithful horse had never failed him so he
was surprised to have him falter. Finally, in spite of the driver\xE2\x80\x99s
agitated words of encouragement, the wagon began to back down hill,
landing in a ditch.

No damage was done, but it was all very mysterious to the junk man. He
could not understand what had happened to the horse. The animal did not
seem to be sick and had never been inclined to be balky. At last he
concluded to take an inventory of the load. Lifting a pile of ancient
burlap bags in the rear of the wagon, he discovered eight or ten large
boulders, each being about as large as two men could lift. It seemed
very amusing to the men working on the highway a short distance away
when the junk man by herculean efforts succeeded in dumping the rocks
out of the end of the wagon.


What Happened to Another Junk Dealer

On another occasion a young scion of a prosperous junk dealer started
out with a high powered automobile to make a quick collection of
burlap grain sacks which at that time were in demand at very high
prices. Naturally he did not care to pay much for these bags and he was
not taken very seriously by the up-to-date farmers whom he visited.
Passing into an unfamiliar section he asked the manager of a large
farm whom he had been annoying by his persistent methods, as to how
he could reach a certain neighborhood not far away where there were a
group of large dairy farms. He received directions and shortly after
appeared at one of these farms complaining bitterly of the state of the
highway. The man who listened to his complaint could not understand
why he had found such bad roads. A little questioning demonstrated the
fact that in his disgust at the unwillingness of the opulent junk man
to take \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D for an answer, the manager of the farm before mentioned
had directed him to take a crossroad which was considered locally as
practically impassable, even for a farm wagon. The commercial tourist
succeeded in making his perilous way across to a place of safety but he
narrowly escaped heart failure.

       *       *       *       *       *

To those of rural districts who seldom travel far from the home
fireside, there are suggestions of possible interest and entertainment
in conversing with strange frequenters of the highway. This was
especially true of earlier days when, because of frugal habits and
rather unsatisfactory public roads, unfamiliar faces in the highways
were few indeed.


The Inquisitive Man by the Roadside

It is not surprising therefore that when a real old gentleman who had
served his community and even his state acceptably in his more active
days, observed an absolute stranger walking rapidly up the road,
he should have meandered out to the front gate for a little closer
inspection.

The traveler was evidently in haste, but was brought up to a short turn
with an interrogation from the old gentleman that it would have been
very impolite to have ignored. Then followed a conversation which is
yet occasionally referred to after more than half a century.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou seem to be in a hurry today.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere did you come from?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI came from Monkton.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen did you leave there?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDay before yesterday.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere did you stay last night?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI stayed in Goshen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere are you going today?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to Jericho.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat are you going to Jericho for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to school.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA man as old as you going to school! What are you going to school for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to school to see if I can\xE2\x80\x99t learn how to mind my own
business.\xE2\x80\x9D

The stranger passed on and left the old man thinking it over. The more
he thought it over the more he was sure it was a good joke on himself,
and being a genuine Yankee, he enjoyed the joke just as well as though
it had been on someone else and it soon became well known to his
acquaintances.

       *       *       *       *       *

But while the interchange of civilities among near or more or less
remote neighbors who chance to meet in the highway, is quite prone to
touch upon the humorous episodes which are constantly happening to
normal human beings, there is occasionally a glimpse of the pathetic.


The Misfortunes of Mr. Foley

A man who had quite an extensive acquaintance in a certain section was
driving to town one day and at a turn of the road met a genial old
Irishman who was jogging his fat and sleepy old horse along toward
home. The two had not met for quite a while and the conversation was
much prolonged. After inquiring as to Uncle Jimmie\xE2\x80\x99s health and that of
his family, and the outlook for the hay crop and various other subjects
of mutual interest, inquiry was made as to some of Uncle Jimmie\xE2\x80\x99s Irish
friends. Finally Mr. Foley\xE2\x80\x99s name was mentioned. A shadow came over
Uncle Jimmie\xE2\x80\x99s face.

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! it is indeed sorry I am for poor Mr. Foley. First he lost the foal
of his mare; then he lost a sow and litter of pigs; and now, poor mon,
he\xE2\x80\x99s lost his wife.\xE2\x80\x9D




CHAPTER XIII

SAD TALES OF PRE-PROHIBITION DAYS.


It would seem to be eminently fitting to group the events chronicled
below in the Thirteenth Chapter of this History.

In the light of present day happenings and with the echoes of rage,
despair and lamentation filling our ears, it would be hard to imagine
the incredulity with which many worthy, and otherwise, patriots of a
former generation would have regarded the possibilities of the present
prohibition era. Indeed, there are many who now, looking back to
earlier days, can with relief affectionately recall various old-timers
who have passed on to another existence, and thus been mercifully
spared the desolate days which now follow each other in hopeless
succession.

However, there is such a thing as carrying pathos too far. So we will
let the scenes shift to a famous day in the history of Hank Towner.


The Return of a War Hero

No one in his native town had ever suspected Hank Towner of being a
hero. The ordinary pursuits of peace held little attraction for Hank,
at least that portion which involved real actual labor. To be sure,
there was plenty of reason why Hank should work every day, but there
were other reasons why he did not work except occasionally, and the
chief of these reasons was John Barleycorn.

However, this is a world of unsuspected opportunity, as Hank found out
for himself. This was many, many years ago, but as Hank persisted long
years after the supposed scriptural limit of seventy years, his history
remains vivid.

War was declared with Mexico, and about the very first to respond to
the call for volunteers was Hank. Military life appealed to him, and
he became a model soldier. This fact, however, made little impression
upon his fellow citizens who had known him so long under different
circumstances. His company marched away and the war went on and
although Hank was reported to be a good soldier, it seemed to his
former associates that there must be some exaggeration about it.

One day the town woke up. There had been a great battle, at least
great for those times, and wonder of wonders, one of their own boys
had distinguished himself and become a national hero. The newspaper
reports were read eagerly and in all details. Hank who was assigned to
a battery company, had remained at his post when his comrades had fled
and had single-handed held the enemy back with volleys of grape-shot.

The town was even more impressed when it was learned that Congress had
passed a vote of thanks to the distinguished soldier whose heroism and
unfailing nerve had saved the day.

Every citizen of this patriotic little town thrilled at this report. To
think that they had had a national hero grow up in their midst and had
never recognized the fact! They really felt ashamed to look each other
in the face. But they resolved if Hank ever got back to his home town
he would get an ovation such as had never been known in that valley
before.

The war came to an end. The troops were ordered home. It was time to
show their appreciation.

A meeting was therefore held and the leading citizens constituting the
Reception Committee were authorized to equip themselves with badges,
engage a band and declare a public holiday for the town, in order
that the distinguished son who had cast such glory upon even the most
conspicuous of the town\xE2\x80\x99s people should receive suitable testimonial
of the esteem in which he was held. This of course is but a meager
abstract of the gracious phrases of those who elaborated the reception
plan.

No railroad reached the town at that time and Boston passengers came by
stagecoach. Definite arrangements were however made by which it could
be known just what day Hank would arrive.

The auspicious day dawned bright and fair and business was practically
suspended. Long before the stage was due to arrive early in the
afternoon, the streets were thronged. The Reception Committee had
repaired to the principal hotel, at which point the stage was to
deliver the distinguished passenger.

Stagecoaches were run on an excellent schedule in those days. And at
about the time prepared for in the program, small boys who had climbed
the tall trees on the hotel lawn, announced in shrill tones that the
stage was coming. A thrill passed through the crowd. This was a day
to remember. And indeed it was. The driver of the six Morgan horses
attached to the stage with the long reins wound around his hands,
brought his equipage skillfully down the long hill and through the
covered bridge, from which point he passed down the street and around
the corner. The road was now straight to the hotel and the spirited
horses came down the street with a rush, drawing up before the hotel
portico with a grace which none but Morgan horses could ever equal.

The Reception Committee of distinguished citizens, wearing their high
hats and badges, now came impressively down the steps of the hotel
and formed in a semi-circle at the side of the coach. Some unfamiliar
passengers climbed down from the top and two or three women looking
exceedingly disgusted, got out of the interior of the coach. There was
an awkward pause. Then someone asked the driver,

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere\xE2\x80\x99s Hank?\xE2\x80\x9D

The driver pointed significantly toward the interior of the coach. The
spokesman of the Reception Committee stepped forward and looked.

Hank had arrived! He was lying in a stupor on the floor of the coach,
while the strong alcoholic odor which floated out upon the atmosphere
made all further questions unnecessary.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is often hard to decide whether the man who performs a kind deed
for his neighbor or the neighbor himself is the most benefited by the
friendly act. In the following instance it is evident that the chief
benefit derived was to the party of the first part.


The Motorist Who Was Good to Antoine

Antoine was a natural born hustler. No one knew better how to get
a bumper crop from his farm or how to drive a harder bargain in a
livestock transaction. His naturally rapid accumulation of assets,
however, was being constantly depleted by the apparent necessity on
his part of taking a few days off every now and then, in order that
he might sample various brands of wet goods. As there was not only a
considerable expenditure of cash, but a loss of time involved in these
holidays, they were expensive, even if we leave out the consideration
of fines imposed when Antoine\xE2\x80\x99s powers of locomotion had become totally
suspended.

It was therefore an unpleasant sight to a certain prosperous young
business man of the vicinity, when one afternoon, at the intersection
of two busy streets he beheld Antoine whom he had known a long time,
ambling along very plainly under the \xE2\x80\x9Cinfluence.\xE2\x80\x9D To the young business
man it seemed a shame that so naturally industrious and worthy a
citizen should be allowed to perambulate directly into the arms of a
cop, which seemed likely to happen in the very near future, and thus
very likely find it necessary to pay a fine before he could get back to
his farm.

These reflections were followed by a noble and generous impulse.
Calling to Antoine, he told him he was going in the direction of the
latter\xE2\x80\x99s farm and would be glad to take him home in his car.

Antoine promptly accepted the invitation, climbed into the car and in
a short time was unloaded, safe and sound, in his own door yard. He
expressed loquacious thanks for the favor which had been done and the
young business man went on to look after some incidental matters in the
vicinity, feeling greatly pleased with himself.

Antoine\xE2\x80\x99s farm was not far distant from the trolley system which took
him into the town from which he had just recently been delivered. When
the motorist had made his rounds and returned to the starting point,
and had run his car up to the curb, he looked up the street and rubbed
his eyes. Had the last two hours been a dream, or had he actually
performed a noble act? A look at his speedometer convinced him that he
had actually made the trip, however.

What he saw that was so confusing was Antoine just getting off the
trolley car. There had been just about time enough since he had been
taken home for him to meander down the road and catch the car for the
original starting point.

Antoine had come back to town to finish the job.

       *       *       *       *       *

To certain citizens there would seem to be something radically wrong
with society when prohibition officers will deliberately receive and
sometimes actually destroy \xE2\x80\x9Cgood liquor.\xE2\x80\x9D


The Tale of a Rescued Keg of Whiskey

It was a shock to Harry W-- years ago when he heard that there had been
a prohibition raid on a certain bottler of soda water and various other
colored fluids, during which several five-gallon \xE2\x80\x9Ckags\xE2\x80\x9D of whiskey,
gin and brandy had been dumped unceremoniously into the river.

It seemed as though something ought to be done about such a reckless
act and after some reflection Harry decided there could be. Hastening
down the street to the outskirts of the town, he entered a fringe of
bushes by the river bank and waited. Sure enough, shortly afterwards
down came two kegs, the bungs of which had been knocked out before
their emersion and which were wabbling along in the current.

Wading out into the stream, Harry succeeded in towing these two kegs to
the shore, and pulling them into the bushes he anxiously sampled the
contents. In one of the receptacles, river water had very sadly marred
the flavor of the original contents, but in the other, by great good
luck, there was very little adulteration. Harry smacked his lips and,
carefully hiding the keg in the brush, hastily withdrew. Late in the
evening he secured his prize and succeeded in taking it unobserved to
the home of his father, with whom he lived, hiding it in the cellar.

When Harry told his father what he had done, the latter was greatly
pleased, but cautioned him that he must not let a certain younger
brother know anything about it, as he might indulge too freely.

From that time on, day after day, the father and son, coming in from
their tasks, would adroitly make their way to the carefully concealed
prize in the cellar, from which they would emerge with that deep
satisfaction associated with luxuries which can be enjoyed at someone\xE2\x80\x99s
else expense.

However, the younger brother became interested. It seemed to him that
there was \xE2\x80\x9Csomething doing\xE2\x80\x9D in the house. So, one morning he decided
that he was not able to work and left to himself he made a careful
search of the cellar. Just what he did afterwards may be inferred from
the sequel.

When the father and son sat down to supper, there was a vacant place.
Hugh was absent. Just what he was doing was uncertain, but the mystery
was soon solved. A kindly neighbor came in to say that a cop had found
Hugh parading the streets in such an extremely hilarious condition
that he had found it necessary to place him in seclusion to sober up.

The next morning Harry and his father went to court, paid the fine
and Hugh was allowed to go home. Just what became of the keg and its
contents does not appear in the history, but it is not likely that it
was taken back to the river.

       *       *       *       *       *

While the anguish produced by prohibition is of recent date in most
states, in one or two New England states it befell to an earlier
generation to endure this form of privation a good many years ago.


The Prohibition Whale Oil

In this region prohibition made its entrance about the time that whale
oil was in its last stages of usefulness for illuminating purposes.

It had been a long established custom to include among other
necessities at the grocery store, the refilling of the family jug
with Medford rum. And when, owing to meddlesome tactics of certain
teetotalers, storekeepers became somewhat shy about replenishing these
jugs, there was much dismay.

However, there were exceptional dealers who not only had a stock of old
Medford on hand, but felt a deep sympathy for old reliable customers
who were thus subjected to such inconvenience, and who would \xE2\x80\x9Cfind
a way.\xE2\x80\x9D One of these ways was to have the customer call for oil and
at the same time give a certain signal. When this plan was working
well, the customer would find the contents of the jug to be entirely
satisfactory.

One Saturday afternoon, two worthy citizens who lived on adjacent
farms back on the hills, started to go to the country store to do a
little \xE2\x80\x9Ctrading\xE2\x80\x9D for their wives. Incidentally one of them took along
the faithful old jug which had been refilled several times in a very
satisfactory way since the prohibition edict was supposed to be in full
working order.

Entering the store, the man with the jug approached the counter and
gave his order for a few small articles needed by the housekeeper at
home. As there were people standing about and the clerk was a new
recruit, the customer asked that the clerk fill the jug with \xE2\x80\x9Coil,\xE2\x80\x9D
at the same time giving him the usual signal, a broad wink. After a
brief chat with acquaintances regarding crops, the weather, etc., the
customer gathered up his parcels and his jug and accompanied by his
neighbor, who had also made some moderate purchases, went outside,
placed the parcels in the buggy and started for home.

It is quite likely that they would not have started for home nearly so
soon but for anticipations associated with the jug. A half mile or so
out of the village there was a bend in the road, an old-time covered
bridge being the only building in sight. The team was brought to a
halt and while the horse started to browse by the roadside, the jug
was brought out by the owner, uncorked and passed over to his friend,
who, relieving himself of a \xE2\x80\x9Cchew,\xE2\x80\x9D lifted the jug to his lips and
took a large mouthful of the contents. Controlling himself by violent
effort, he passed the jug back to the owner who was waiting with as
much patience as he could muster, leaned over the side of the buggy
and succeeded in relieving his mouth of its unwelcome contents. The
owner of the jug, however, was not so fortunate, as in his eagerness he
swallowed a good-sized mouthful of the whale oil before he discovered
his horrible mistake.

Tradition has it that these two worthies were never quite so friendly
after that unfortunate incident. What happened to the store clerk is
unknown.

Kerosene oil would doubtless prove to be a very enticing beverage
compared with whale oil, perhaps as nauseous as any oleaginous
substance yet discovered.

       *       *       *       *       *

When in prohibition times some pleading citizen who has been the
recipient of illegitimate favors becomes too much elated and
\xE2\x80\x9Cdiscloses\xE2\x80\x9D on his benefactor (?), he is regarded by the faithful as
having reached the subterranean depths of infamy.


The Righteous Wrath of \xE2\x80\x9CMarm\xE2\x80\x9D Hooker

Such was the opinion at least of a certain robust woman who kept
a hotel and who was widely known as Marm Hooker. Yielding to the
persuasions and implorings of a certain ne\xE2\x80\x99er-do-well, she supplied him
with a flask of stimulant which he needed for his \xE2\x80\x9Crun down system.\xE2\x80\x9D
The result was that the object of her benevolence became hilarious
and later on, under the severe cross-examination of the prohibition
officer, \xE2\x80\x9Cdisclosed\xE2\x80\x9D on his benefactress. In her opinion, human
depravity could reach no lower depths.

Besides providing accommodations for man and beast in the function of
tavern keeper, Marm Hooker would arrange once a month or so during
the winter for a public dance in the old-fashioned hall at her hotel.
Patrons who attended these dances were not exclusive in their social
ideas.

In a remote corner of the second floor of the tavern, there was a small
room and when the dance was well under way, Marm Hooker would withdraw
to this little sanctum of hers, while those whom she regarded as
trustworthy would one by one secure admission for two or three minutes.

One night who should appear at this dance, which was public, but the
ignominious person who had at one time \xE2\x80\x9Cdisclosed.\xE2\x80\x9D When Marm Hooker
learned that he was present, she frowned, but when she opened the door
of her sanctum, after repeated knocks and found that this same person
had the unparalleled impudence to again ask for liquid refreshments,
her indignation found expression, with such effect that the applicant
slunk away in confusion.

An hour passed. At a certain signal the door would be opened and a
customer admitted. Business had been brisk and the robust proprietress
had forgotten for a moment the impudent assurance of the man whom she
had chased away. There came another signal in exactly the prescribed
form and this genial lady, opening the door two or three inches, had it
pushed wider open and who should come inside but the obnoxious visitor
aforesaid. As he came in, he slammed the door shut, locked it and put
the key in his pocket. He then informed Marm Hooker that he should not
leave unless she supplied him with a flask of whiskey.

It would appear that the robust lady was cornered, but subsequent
events proved otherwise. Pausing for a moment in amazement at the
boldness of the intruder, she rushed forward and seizing the man with
an iron grip, hurled him against the door with such force that it was
completely shattered, the victim falling in a heap outside.

Righteous indignation can accomplish wonders.

       *       *       *       *       *

Those who reside in the great cities become somewhat callous to those
frequent tragedies to which poor humanity is still subject. But there
was considerable excitement in a little country town one morning
when an elderly resident was found dead in a clump of bushes by the
roadside.


\xE2\x80\x9CPoor Kelly Took the Rest\xE2\x80\x9D

The victim, named Kelly, was an amiable, harmless individual who was
well along in years and led a rather inactive life. While there were no
marks indicating violence, the circumstances were somewhat suspicious.

An inquest seemed in order and the proper officials gathered at a
suitable location to investigate, so far as possible, the circumstances
associated with the case. Inquiries, however, seemed to produce no
results, until at last someone recalled seeing Mr. Kelly the day before
in the company of Uncle Jimmy Daley, a kind and generally respected old
man who lived on a little farm some miles away.

A sheriff\xE2\x80\x99s officer was therefore hurriedly dispatched with a lively
horse to bring Uncle Jimmy to the inquest. In a relatively short time
Uncle Jimmy appeared, apparently very much cast down at the sad news
regarding Mr. Kelly.

Various other witnesses, who later recalled having seen the deceased on
the previous day, gave their testimony one after another, Uncle Jimmy
sitting disconsolately in the background. Finally he was called forward
and asked to tell what he knew of the departed.

There was of course an opportunity for the witness to go into
considerable detail, but he did not apparently consider it necessary.
And after he had made his simple statement, there seemed to be no
occasion to procrastinate the proceedings any further.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Uncle Jimmy, \xE2\x80\x9CI found Mr. Kelly yisterday here in tow-un
and as he lives along the road toward my place, I invited him to ride
with me. After we had gone up the road a piece, Mr. Kelly took a good
sized bottle of whiskey out of his pocket and offered me a drink.
Indeed he offered me several drinks on the way.\xE2\x80\x9D

The court thus assembled listened with breathless attention to this
simple statement of the witness, but were even more impressed with his
final words:

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Uncle Jimmy in a sad refrain, \xE2\x80\x9CI took what was good for me,
and Kelly, poor mon, took the rest. And now he\xE2\x80\x99s no more the day.\xE2\x80\x9D

Uncle Jimmy was excused. The court hastily agreed upon a verdict and
the inquest was over.




CHAPTER XIV

TALES OF THE FARM HIRED MAN


Any record of New England rural life would be incomplete that left out
the farm hired man.

The farm employer who does not make a careful study of how to get the
best service he can from his help, and at the same time retain that
good will and cheerful co-operation which are so essential to pleasant
personal relations, is not likely to succeed to any satisfactory degree.


The Hand Mowers at Murray\xE2\x80\x99s

Mr. Murray conducted a large and somewhat rocky farm in the days before
farm machinery had been developed to anything like its present state
of efficiency. He had a large field of grass that he was in a hurry to
cut and put in the barn. The field was pretty nearly rectangular and
one July day Mr. Murray devised a very ingenious plan. There were four
hired men to undertake the job of mowing the field with hand scythes.
Three of these men were assigned brief tasks, the fourth taking his
place to turn the grindstone while the proprietor ground the scythe.
This man was then told to mow around the field.

Another man was called up to perform the same duty at the grindstone,
after which he was sent after number one. The third and fourth each
took their turn and was started after the others.

It took just about the same time at the grindstone as to mow across
one side of the rectangular field. Consequently number one was just
starting on the last lap when number four struck in behind the others.

The owner\xE2\x80\x99s scheme was now plain to the four mowers. He was expecting
each man would exert himself to overtake the next one. But instead of
being resentful, the humor of the situation appealed to them. They
entered into the spirit of the occasion with enthusiasm and before
twelve noon they had completed their tasks and made a record.

Naturally the owner of the farm was much pleased with the result of
his carefully laid out plan. But it is not to be supposed that other
occasions did not furnish opportunity for the hired men to get even.
The farm holder who tries crafty methods to secure abnormal production
by his employees must expect to see the score balanced sooner or later.

       *       *       *       *       *

That \xE2\x80\x9CHope springs eternal in the human breast,\xE2\x80\x9D is shown by endless
demonstrations. A conspicuous example of that hope appeared in the
unique experience of the country editor.


The Sporting Venture of the Country Editor

In a certain green valley of a New England state, there was a race
course.... There were many gamey horses in that valley and the speeding
fever ran high. Several successive trotting events associated with
agricultural fairs, had drawn the attention of horse lovers to the
excellent track. And so it came about that the editor of a little
country weekly, who lived some distance away, conceived a brilliant
plan. Tired of the meager rewards of news gathering, he decided to
organize a trotting tournament on this popular track and make a grand
coup.

Therefore he made his announcements of several races for which he
solicited entries by well-known horsemen. The response in this respect
was disappointing, but he felt sure the revenues from gate admissions
would make the venture successful.

The eventful day was fair and the editor was quite elated to see a
considerable crowd gathering to watch the races. This state of mind,
however, received a rude shock when he sauntered out to the entrance to
get an estimate on the receipts. He found to his dismay that a large
proportion of the admissions had been on the strength of an annual pass.

Hastening to the secretary of the Association, he was blandly informed
that the grading of the track had been done on a co-operative plan by
which all the farmers of the valley who contributed a certain amount
of labor were entitled to admission at all times, except during the
week when the annual fair was being held.

This was a staggering blow. He was under obligations to pay the
trotting purses and the prospects were that he would be several hundred
dollars out of pocket. Accordingly he hastened to the owners of the
trotting horses and proposed that they accept a pro rata percentage
of the premiums as substitutes for the full amounts. He was coolly
informed that they didn\xE2\x80\x99t do business that way. Considering themselves
victimized, the owners began to take their horses off the grounds.

It was about at this point that real trouble began to loom up. Of those
visitors who had actually paid good money for admission, there was
a large element of farm hired men. They began to clamor for action.
They wanted what they had paid for. Getting no satisfaction from the
race horse people, they demanded an audience with the editor. He was
invisible. Finally someone reported that he had been seen entering the
woods in the rear of the grounds.

Just as the vociferous youths had about decided to organize a hunt and
capture the fugitive dead or alive, a carriage came dashing through
the gateway and a well-known citizen pulled up his horse before the
crowd, and demanded the attention of all. He said the gentleman by his
side was the man they were looking for and that, although he had been
alarmed by their threatening manner and had hastened away, he had come
back to face the music.

The editor now arose and announced that he had arranged for the race
events to be carried out. The volatile spirits of the boys were quickly
evident. The races were called. The horses performed in a satisfactory
manner and harmony reigned.

But back in seclusion the poor country editor was signing time notes to
make up the losses of the day.

And yet hope springs eternal!

The husky farm hand who works hard during the day might be expected to
retire early. And indeed he often does; but there are occasions when he
does not find it necessary.

It is really astonishing how much day and night work the healthy
outdoor worker of twenty or twenty-five can endure.


\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve Found the Spring\xE2\x80\x9D

It was late summer and very busy times on the farm, but this did not
stand in the way of plans for a certain evening\xE2\x80\x99s festivities. These
plans involved several young men, a robust but tender young rooster and
a supply of fresh, green corn, also for roasting purposes.

The scenes of these activities were on the shore of a little lake. The
fringe of trees stretching along the shore allowed the selection of a
location which was invisible to all but the parties interested.

The banquet was a great success. The corn was delicious and the roast
chicken even more so. There was an abundance of jokes and time passed
rapidly.

A supply of fresh water had been brought from the lake, but it was warm
and tasteless. Finally one of the boys suggested that he thought there
was a cold spring near by, if they could only locate it.

Away from the cheerful blaze of the bonfire, the shores of the lake
were dark as Egypt. But finally one of the boys said he believed he
could find that spring. Taking a small, tin pail, which they had
thoughtfully brought with them, he started out.

Nothing could be seen of the young man, but his flounderings about
among the dense underbrush were plainly audible. Time passed and he
seemed to have had considerable difficulty in locating the spring.
Conversation died away, as all were watching and listening. Suddenly
there came a noise of a succession of ramblings about in the bushes,
followed by a loud splash as of someone falling heavily in the lake.
The young men by the bonfire leaped to their feet. They were alarmed
but speedily reassured.

There was a gurgling noise for a moment, next the sound of someone
swimming in the lake and later pulling himself up by the bushes,
and then the well-known voice of the missing man came back with the
cheering words:

\xE2\x80\x9CBoys, I have found the spring!\xE2\x80\x9D

       *       *       *       *       *

As before stated, it is the tactful farm owner who secures the most
satisfactory production in the way of farm labor. The professional
farm hand with years of experience behind him, is quite prone to be
resentful of criticism.


The Expert Who Repaired the Fences

One of these old-time laborers was employed by a man who owned several
adjacent farms and there was always a superabundance of work on hand.

This farmer had a large mountain pasture for his young cattle and it
was rather essential that the fences be secure, as otherwise the cattle
might break through, wander away and be hopelessly astray before they
were missed.

One spring an old veteran farm hand was intrusted with the task of
repairing these fences. After several days, he reported that everything
was all right and was assigned to other work. A day or two later, a man
residing on the other side of the mountain, reported that the young
cattle had broken out and were in his enclosure.

The \xE2\x80\x9Cboys,\xE2\x80\x9D including the veteran aforesaid, were sent after the
strayers and devoted the entire afternoon in getting them back into
their proper domain. The next morning the same veteran fence fixer set
out again with instructions to make a thorough job of the repairs this
time, so that there would be no further trouble. He spent another day
on the fences and came back at night with positive assurances to the
owner that the young cattle could not possibly go astray again.

Two or three days later, the same neighbor came from the same distant
farm, informing them that the cattle had once more broken through the
fences and again a rescue party was sent after the wanderers.

That evening at the supper table those present seemed disposed to
consider the entire matter a pretty good joke on the fence builder,
who expressed his unqualified amazement as to how the fence could have
given away after all he had done to put it in repair.

The owner of the farm who had listened to the various jocose comments
in silence, finally volunteered an explanation:

\xE2\x80\x9CProbably a chipmunk ran along the fence somewhere and broke it down.\xE2\x80\x9D

When next the fence builder reported a satisfactory job, his guarantee
was found to be reliable.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sometimes the farm hand becomes a fixture in the family and is regarded
with real affection by those whom he has seen grow up from childhood.


The Man Who \xE2\x80\x9CArrived In a Great Hurry\xE2\x80\x9D

In a certain bustling New England city, there was a young married woman
who retained a very considerable regard for the \xE2\x80\x9Chired man\xE2\x80\x9D who had
lived in her family from her earliest recollections, even until the
present. It was her great desire to have \xE2\x80\x9CUncle Harvey\xE2\x80\x9D come down to
her city home and let her show him around. As he had scarcely ever left
the town in which he was born and had passed his lifetime, this lady
could see great possibilities of entertainment for herself as well as
for Uncle Harvey. Making her annual summer visit at the old homestead,
she repeated her invitation with such earnestness that Uncle Harvey was
finally, but with evident reluctance, induced to promise to visit her
without fail that fall.

Every time she wrote home she sent reminders that she had the old man\xE2\x80\x99s
positive promise and that he must not fail her. Finally he decided he
had to go.

Uncle Harvey had had very little experience in railroad travel and it
was quite a good many miles from the farm to the city home where he
was to be entertained. After considerable discussion as to whether he
should take a very early train that stopped at all stations, or go on a
later express train, he was finally induced to take his chances on the
fast train, although if left to his own choice he would have preferred
the slower train as probably being more safe to travel on.

With a new traveling bag, especially purchased for the occasion,
carefully packed for him, Uncle Harvey, in a stunning new suit
complete, was carried to the railroad station, assisted to buy his
ticket and escorted onto the train. His excitement was manifest,
although with pretended calmness he tried to keep it hidden. His escort
shook the old man\xE2\x80\x99s hand warmly and reminded him that he had promised
to write a postal card as soon as he reached his destination.

The train moved out of the station and Uncle Harvey was lost to sight,
but true to his promise he sent the postal card which arrived at the
farm the very next day. It was as follows:

    \xE2\x80\x9CDear Folks:

    I am here safe and sound. Ethel met me at the station. I am
    having a fine time.

    P. S. I arrived in a great hurry about three o\xE2\x80\x99clock.

  Uncle Harvey.\xE2\x80\x9D

It is one of the delightful tributes to our present civilization that
it is perfectly possible for an intelligent woman to live an entire
lifetime and still be so shielded from the sordid things in life as to
be hardly aware of their existence.


\xE2\x80\x9CWhere\xE2\x80\x99s Hadlock?\xE2\x80\x9D

In the cheery kitchen of an old but beautiful New England farmhouse, an
elderly woman was busily engaged in preparing the evening meal. She was
a woman of education and broad sympathies, prominent in the church and
in all good works. Her kindly solicitude for the household took into
account even the most transient laborer temporarily employed on the
farm.

One of the hands who had lived at the farm for several years was taking
a short vacation. It had vaguely come to the ears of the kind lady that
this man had been known to indulge a little too freely in stimulants.
It seemed to her, however, that there must be some mistake about these
rumors, in view of the never-failing good behavior, respectful manner
and general capability of the man in his relations with the family and
the farm.

Sad to say on this occasion above mentioned, there was disillusionment
in store for this friendly lady.

The kitchen door opened and the man who had been on vacation entered.
The cheery welcome with which she was about to greet him was checked on
her lips. Somehow he looked strange----different.

Standing in the entrance to the room and swaying slightly on his feet,
the man, whose hat was tilted a little to one side, inquired in tones
of solemn gravity:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere\xE2\x80\x99s Hadlock?\xE2\x80\x9D

The woman looked at him in utter bewilderment. He smiled a silly smile
and again asked the question:

\xE2\x80\x9CShay, where\xE2\x80\x99s Hadlock?\xE2\x80\x9D

And now it dawned upon this estimable old lady that those stories which
had come to her in the past must have had some foundation. For the man
who was asking this question was Hadlock himself.

       *       *       *       *       *

Many tales have been told of the French-Canadian \xE2\x80\x9Chabitant\xE2\x80\x9D which would
imply that he is a very conservative person. It would appear, however,
that when he becomes transplanted on a farm in \xE2\x80\x9Cthe States,\xE2\x80\x9D he is
quite capable of getting up to date.


A French-Canadian Version of Employers\xE2\x80\x99 Liability Insurance

A wide awake \xE2\x80\x9CCanuck\xE2\x80\x9D who was branching out as a progressive farmer in
a New England state, became much interested in a proposed employers\xE2\x80\x99
liability bill which was up for discussion in the legislature. Some
of his friends, being a little skeptical, he proceeded to make the
matter clear to them----how successfully the reader may judge from the
following:

\xE2\x80\x9CAll dose farmer mans be protect so when hees ole mare kick himself up,
broke it the harness, kill de wagon and de hire mans; or if the mow
machine run away from de span hoss and kill the whole beesness, hire
man, machine and horse,----What for that farmer mans hees be blame in
dis bill? No, sir; I guess not!\xE2\x80\x9D

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

By Jane Austen



Chapter 1


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Mr. Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D said his lady to him one day, \xE2\x80\x9Chave you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it is,\xE2\x80\x9D returned she; \xE2\x80\x9Cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you not want to know who has taken it?\xE2\x80\x9D cried his wife impatiently.

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was invitation enough.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is his name?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBingley.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he married or single?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow so? How can it affect them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Mr. Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D replied his wife, \xE2\x80\x9Chow can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that his design in settling here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDesign! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
party.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to
go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to
visit him if you do not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey have none of them much to recommend them,\xE2\x80\x9D replied he; \xE2\x80\x9Cthey are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You
take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh, you do not know what I suffer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.



Chapter 2


Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with:

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\xE2\x80\x9D said her mother
resentfully, \xE2\x80\x9Csince we are not to visit.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you forget, mamma,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo more have I,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\xE2\x80\x99s sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CKitty has no discretion in her coughs,\xE2\x80\x9D said her father; \xE2\x80\x9Cshe times
them ill.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not cough for my own amusement,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Kitty fretfully. \xE2\x80\x9CWhen is
your next ball to be, Lizzy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo-morrow fortnight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAye, so it is,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cand Mrs. Long does not come back
till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI honour your circumspection. A fortnight\xE2\x80\x99s acquaintance is certainly
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \xE2\x80\x9CNonsense,
nonsense!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\xE2\x80\x9D cried he. \xE2\x80\x9CDo
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books and make extracts.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,\xE2\x80\x9D he continued, \xE2\x80\x9Clet us return to Mr.
Bingley.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sick of Mr. Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D cried his wife.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If
I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called
on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now.\xE2\x80\x9D

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat an excellent father you have, girls!\xE2\x80\x9D said she, when the door was
shut. \xE2\x80\x9CI do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said Lydia stoutly, \xE2\x80\x9CI am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I\xE2\x80\x99m the tallest.\xE2\x80\x9D

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.



Chapter 3


Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s heart were entertained.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \xE2\x80\x9Cand all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\xE2\x80\x9D

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s visit, and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.

An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already
had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get
a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only
six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.

Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he
was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all
his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.

Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
to join it.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI would not be so fastidious as you are,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D and turning round he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
\xE2\x80\x9CShe is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.

The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\xE2\x80\x99s
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife\xE2\x80\x99s views on
the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a
different story to hear.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D as she entered the room, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her
twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,
and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf he had had any compassion for _me_,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her husband impatiently,
\xE2\x80\x9Che would not have danced half so much! For God\xE2\x80\x99s sake, say no more of
his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
Hurst\xE2\x80\x99s gown--\xE2\x80\x9D

Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I can assure you,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 4


When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
much she admired him.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is just what a young man ought to be,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Csensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much
ease, with such perfect good breeding!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is also handsome,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhich a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
did not expect such a compliment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
stupider person.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Lizzy!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
life.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
what I think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it
everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the
good of everybody\xE2\x80\x99s character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man\xE2\x80\x99s sisters,
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she
was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brother\xE2\x80\x99s fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade.

Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.

His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately.

Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s regard, Bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offense.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
but she smiled too much.

Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one
whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.



Chapter 5


Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;
and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,
unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
James\xE2\x80\x99s had made him courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s intimate friend.

That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas. \xE2\x80\x9C_You_ were Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s first choice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; but he seemed to like his second better.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr. Robinson.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson\xE2\x80\x99s asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question: \xE2\x80\x98Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Charlotte. \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI beg you would not put it into Lizzy\xE2\x80\x99s head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you quite sure, ma\xE2\x80\x99am?--is not there a little mistake?\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane.
\xE2\x80\x9CI certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at
being spoke to.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bingley told me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he never speaks much,
unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Lucas, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I
wish he had danced with Eliza.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnother time, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said her mother, \xE2\x80\x9CI would not dance with _him_,
if I were you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHis pride,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Lucas, \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is very true,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPride,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, \xE2\x80\x9Cis a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D cried a young Lucas, who came with
his sisters, \xE2\x80\x9CI should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs.
Bennet; \xE2\x80\x9Cand if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
directly.\xE2\x80\x9D

The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.



Chapter 6


The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards
the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother\xE2\x80\x99s admiration. It
was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and
to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt may perhaps be pleasant,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9Cto be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
discover it too.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRemember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\xE2\x80\x99s disposition as you do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his
attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for
falling in love as much as she chooses.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour plan is a good one,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhere nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
these are not Jane\xE2\x80\x99s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9CI wish Jane success with all my heart; and
if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.

He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas\xE2\x80\x99s, where a large party were
assembled.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat does Mr. Darcy mean,\xE2\x80\x9D said she to Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9Cby listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are severe on us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Lucas. \xE2\x80\x9CI am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers.\xE2\x80\x9D On Miss Lucas\xE2\x80\x99s persevering, however,
she added, \xE2\x80\x9CVery well, if it must be so, it must.\xE2\x80\x9D And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9CThere is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of
course familiar with: \xE2\x80\x98Keep your breath to cool your porridge\xE2\x80\x99; and I
shall keep mine to swell my song.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.

Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.

Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.\xE2\x80\x9D

Sir William only smiled. \xE2\x80\x9CYour friend performs delightfully,\xE2\x80\x9D he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
you often dance at St. James\xE2\x80\x99s?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have a house in town, I conclude?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy bowed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond
of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas.\xE2\x80\x9D

He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed
to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.\xE2\x80\x9D
 And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half-hour.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy is all politeness,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, smiling.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,
we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a
partner?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:

\xE2\x80\x9CI can guess the subject of your reverie.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should imagine not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the
nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Elizabeth Bennet.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Elizabeth Bennet!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Miss Bingley. \xE2\x80\x9CI am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you
joy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady\xE2\x80\x99s
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.



Chapter 7


Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\xE2\x80\x99s
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.

She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.

The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner\xE2\x80\x99s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters\xE2\x80\x99, and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
headquarters.

Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers\xE2\x80\x99 names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of
felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign.

After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed:

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced.\xE2\x80\x9D

Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am astonished, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
of anybody\xE2\x80\x99s children, it should not be of my own, however.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when
I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William\xE2\x80\x99s in
his regimentals.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMamma,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Lydia, \xE2\x80\x9Cmy aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\xE2\x80\x99s as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke\xE2\x80\x99s library.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is from Miss Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, and then read it aloud.

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR FRIEND,--

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
for a whole day\xE2\x80\x99s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a
quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,

\xE2\x80\x9CCAROLINE BINGLEY\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith the officers!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Lydia. \xE2\x80\x9CI wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDining out,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat is very unlucky.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCan I have the carriage?\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat would be a good scheme,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s chaise to go to Meryton,
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI had much rather go in the coach.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if you have got them to-day,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cmy mother\xE2\x80\x99s purpose
will be answered.\xE2\x80\x9D

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAREST LIZZY,--

\xE2\x80\x9CI find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the
matter with me.--Yours, etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, \xE2\x80\x9Cif your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking
was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow can you be so silly,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cas to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs this a hint to me, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said her father, \xE2\x80\x9Cto send for the
horses?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI admire the activity of your benevolence,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Mary, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe will go as far as Meryton with you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf we make haste,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lydia, as they walked along, \xE2\x80\x9Cperhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\xE2\x80\x9D

In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers\xE2\x80\x99 wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.

She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother\xE2\x80\x99s manners there was something better than politeness; there
was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as
to the occasion\xE2\x80\x99s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.

Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her.

When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in
fact, nothing to do elsewhere.

When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
of clothes.



Chapter 8


At five o\xE2\x80\x99clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s, she could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.

Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
same, and added:

\xE2\x80\x9CShe has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
looked almost wild.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour picture may be very exact, Louisa,\xE2\x80\x9D said Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut this was
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such
an exhibition.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Bingley.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied; \xE2\x80\x9Cthey were brightened by the exercise.\xE2\x80\x9D A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:

\xE2\x80\x9CI have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
no chance of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is capital,\xE2\x80\x9D added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cit
would not make them one jot less agreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy.

To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend\xE2\x80\x99s vulgar relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you prefer reading to cards?\xE2\x80\x9D said he; \xE2\x80\x9Cthat is rather singular.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Eliza Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cdespises cards. She is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9CI am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Cand
I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
others--all that his library afforded.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am astonished,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat my father should have left
so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt ought to be good,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cit has been the work of many
generations.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNeglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish it may.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am talking of possibilities, Charles.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very
little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew
near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his
eldest sister, to observe the game.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Cwill
she be as tall as I am?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s height, or
rather taller.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished
for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is amazing to me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Chow young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure
I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour list of the common extent of accomplishments,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Chas
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNor I, I am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! certainly,\xE2\x80\x9D cried his faithful assistant, \xE2\x80\x9Cno one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides
all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half-deserved.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll this she must possess,\xE2\x80\x9D added Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Cand to all this she must
yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe united.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.

\xE2\x80\x9CElizabeth Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
\xE2\x80\x9Cis one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUndoubtedly,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthere is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother\xE2\x80\x99s proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief
to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.



Chapter 9


Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\xE2\x80\x99s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
would not listen, therefore, to her daughter\xE2\x80\x99s proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed I have, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D was her answer. \xE2\x80\x9CShe is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRemoved!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Bingley. \xE2\x80\x9CIt must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may depend upon it, Madam,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthat Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she
remains with us.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cif it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are
nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the
country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it
in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhatever I do is done in a hurry,\xE2\x80\x9D replied he; \xE2\x80\x9Cand therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou begin to comprehend me, do you?\xE2\x80\x9D cried he, turning towards her.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cremember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI did not know before,\xE2\x80\x9D continued Bingley immediately, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you were a
studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
least that advantage.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe country,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Ccan in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood. \xE2\x80\x9CI assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town.\xE2\x80\x9D

Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I am in the country,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9CI never wish to leave it;
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman,\xE2\x80\x9D looking at Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Cseemed to think the country was nothing
at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. \xE2\x80\x9CYou quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
which you must acknowledge to be true.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So
genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid Charlotte dine with you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;
_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,
I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe seems a very pleasant young woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane\xE2\x80\x99s beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he
did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses
on her, and very pretty they were.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd so ended his affection,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth impatiently. \xE2\x80\x9CThere has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy.

\xE2\x80\x9COf a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attention of the officers, to whom her uncle\xE2\x80\x99s good dinners, and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very
equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother\xE2\x80\x99s ear:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lydia declared herself satisfied. \xE2\x80\x9COh! yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\xE2\x80\x9D she
added, \xE2\x80\x9CI shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\xE2\x80\x99 behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s witticisms on _fine eyes_.



Chapter 10


The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in union with her opinion of each.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\xE2\x80\x9D

He made no answer.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou write uncommonly fast.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPray tell your sister that I long to see her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have already told her so once, by your desire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you--but I always mend my own.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow can you contrive to write so even?\xE2\x80\x9D

He was silent.

\xE2\x80\x9CTell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
present I have not room to do them justice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease, cannot write ill.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her
brother, \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for
words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy style of writing is very different from yours.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9CCharles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour humility, Mr. Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cmust disarm reproof.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing is more deceitful,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Cthan the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNay,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,
I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, \xE2\x80\x98Bingley, you had better
stay till next week,\xE2\x80\x99 you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and at another word, might stay a month.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have only proved by this,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
more than he did himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am exceedingly gratified,\xE2\x80\x9D said Bingley, \xE2\x80\x9Cby your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWould Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBy all means,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Clet us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.

\xE2\x80\x9CI see your design, Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said his friend. \xE2\x80\x9CYou dislike an argument,
and want to silence this.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat you ask,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cis no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.

Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s eyes were fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her
because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,
however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.

After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by
a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her:

\xE2\x80\x9CDo not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?\xE2\x80\x9D

She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say \xE2\x80\x98Yes,\xE2\x80\x99
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed I do not dare.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.

Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed
in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. As for your Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s picture, you must not have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.\xE2\x80\x9D

At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.

\xE2\x80\x9CI did not know that you intended to walk,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou used us abominably ill,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Mrs. Hurst, \xE2\x80\x9Crunning away without
telling us that you were coming out.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said:

\xE2\x80\x9CThis walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue.\xE2\x80\x9D

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered:

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear
to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Good-bye.\xE2\x80\x9D

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.



Chapter 11


When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.

But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also
made her a slight bow, and said he was \xE2\x80\x9Cvery glad;\xE2\x80\x9D but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s salutation. He was full of joy and
attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from
the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone
else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.

When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
and rings, joined now and then in her brother\xE2\x80\x99s conversation with Miss
Bennet.

Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \xE2\x80\x9CHow pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library.\xE2\x80\x9D

No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CBy the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are
not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you mean Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her brother, \xE2\x80\x9Che may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send
round my cards.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should like balls infinitely better,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cif they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
the day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMuch more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but
Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In
the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,
turning to Elizabeth, said:

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
meaning?\xE2\x80\x9D--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all,\xE2\x80\x9D was her answer; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. \xE2\x80\x9CYou either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other\xE2\x80\x99s confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be
completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! shocking!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Bingley. \xE2\x80\x9CI never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CWe
can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will
not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CThat is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a
laugh.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Chas given me more credit than can be.
The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their
actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth--\xE2\x80\x9Cthere are such people, but I hope I
am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,
and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely
what you are without.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSuch as vanity and pride.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

\xE2\x80\x9CYour examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bingley;
\xE2\x80\x9Cand pray what is the result?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
himself without disguise.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9CI have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost
forever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_That_ is a failing indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CImplacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd _your_ defect is to hate everybody.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd yours,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied with a smile, \xE2\x80\x9Cis willfully to misunderstand
them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo let us have a little music,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. \xE2\x80\x9CLouisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst?\xE2\x80\x9D

Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments\xE2\x80\x99 recollection, was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.



Chapter 12


In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane\xE2\x80\x99s week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them
very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.

To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope
of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.

On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of
its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.

They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it
had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.



Chapter 13


\xE2\x80\x9CI hope, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled. \xE2\x80\x9CA gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be
got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this
moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is _not_ Mr. Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said her husband; \xE2\x80\x9Cit is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life.\xE2\x80\x9D

This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:

\xE2\x80\x9CAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago
I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D cried his wife, \xE2\x80\x9CI cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They
had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which
Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cand
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did
before him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Sir,--

\xE2\x80\x9CThe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but
for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--\xE2\x80\x98There, Mrs.
Bennet.\xE2\x80\x99--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having
received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de
Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the
offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for
it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o\xE2\x80\x99clock, and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se\xE2\x80\x99ennight
following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I
remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

\xE2\x80\x9CWILLIAM COLLINS\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt four o\xE2\x80\x99clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. \xE2\x80\x9CHe seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if
he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThough it is difficult,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cto guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe must be an oddity, I think,\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CI cannot make him
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn point of composition,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mary, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed.\xE2\x80\x9D

To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.

Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a
tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted--\xE2\x80\x9D

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s admiration. The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its
cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who
assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a
good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He
begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.



Chapter 14


During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh\xE2\x80\x99s attention to his wishes, and consideration for
his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that \xE2\x80\x9Che had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cand
I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s residence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \xE2\x80\x9Cthen she is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHas she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHer indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the
British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that
her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou judge very properly,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cand it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.

By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,
glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily
assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything
announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and
begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at
him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
deliberation he chose Fordyce\xE2\x80\x99s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the
volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three
pages, she interrupted him with:

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.



Chapter 15


Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which
he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father\xE2\x80\x99s
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.

His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a
quarter of an hour\xE2\x80\x99s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. \xE2\x80\x9CAs to
her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before was now high in her good graces.

Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.

In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were
immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was
the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came
to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the
stranger\xE2\x80\x99s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,
determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under
pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately
had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with
him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a
commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of
beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together
very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy
and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the
ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and
Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to
Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated
it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,
after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.

In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Phillip\xE2\x80\x99s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s
pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of
Mrs. Phillips\xE2\x80\x99s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
invitation.

Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,
from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was
eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as
their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing
about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones\xE2\x80\x99s shop-boy in the
street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility
was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\xE2\x80\x99s introduction of him. She
received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with
as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous
acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,
however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,
however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that
Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a
lieutenant\xE2\x80\x99s commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the
last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.
Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the
occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become \xE2\x80\x9Cstupid,
disagreeable fellows.\xE2\x80\x9D Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses
the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either
or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain
such behaviour than her sister.

Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring
Mrs. Phillips\xE2\x80\x99s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.



Chapter 16


As no objection was made to the young people\xE2\x80\x99s engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and
the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\xE2\x80\x99s invitation, and was then in
the house.

When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper\xE2\x80\x99s room.

In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and
the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel
that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
interesting by the skill of the speaker.

With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he
had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know little of the game at present,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation in life--\xE2\x80\x9D Mrs. Phillips was very
glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.

Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear
him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not
even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.

\xE2\x80\x9CAbout a month,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, \xE2\x80\x9CHe is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Wickham; \xE2\x80\x9Chis estate there is a noble one. A clear
ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for
I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
infancy.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs much as I ever wish to be,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth very warmly. \xE2\x80\x9CI have
spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have no right to give _my_ opinion,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wickham, \xE2\x80\x9Cas to his being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_
to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in
the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot pretend to be sorry,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wickham, after a short
interruption, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.\xE2\x80\x9D Wickham only shook his head.

\xE2\x80\x9CI wonder,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense
of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he
is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never
be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by
a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.

Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that
he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
intelligible gallantry.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\xE2\x80\x9D he added,
\xE2\x80\x9Cwhich was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be
a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood heavens!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut how could _that_ be? How could his
will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain
it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was
of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and
I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can
recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort
of men, and that he hates me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSome time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut what,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, after a pause, \xE2\x80\x9Ccan have been his motive? What can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\xE2\x80\x99s uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
of preference which was often given me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this.\xE2\x80\x9D

After a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99 reflection, however, she continued, \xE2\x80\x9CI _do_
remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition
must be dreadful.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will not trust myself on the subject,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Wickham; \xE2\x80\x9CI can hardly
be just to him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \xE2\x80\x9CTo
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!\xE2\x80\x9D She could have added, \xE2\x80\x9CA young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable\xE2\x80\x9D--but she contented herself
with, \xE2\x80\x9Cand one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,
connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of
use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father\xE2\x80\x99s active superintendence,
and when, immediately before my father\xE2\x80\x99s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow strange!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CHow abominable! I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for
dishonesty I must call it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt _is_ wonderful,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Wickham, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor almost all his actions may
be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has
connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCan such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what
his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,
to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

He shook his head. \xE2\x80\x9CI wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very
proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is
nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father\xE2\x80\x99s death, her
home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
education.\xE2\x80\x9D

After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you
know Mr. Bingley?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CProbably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is
a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His
pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something
for fortune and figure.\xE2\x80\x9D

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every
point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,
he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged
that she would not make herself uneasy.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know very well, madam,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat when persons sit down to a
card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.

\xE2\x80\x9CLady Catherine de Bourgh,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, \xE2\x80\x9Chas very lately given him
a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\xE2\x80\x9D

This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined for another.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Collins,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe her to be both in a great degree,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Wickham; \xE2\x80\x9CI have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her
nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
understanding of the first class.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper
put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise
of Mrs. Phillips\xE2\x80\x99s supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name
as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.



Chapter 17


Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey have both,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cbeen deceived, I dare say, in some way
or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLaugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\xE2\x80\x99s favourite in such
a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s being imposed on, than
that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it
be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his
looks.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to
think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\xE2\x80\x9D

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,
if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair
became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed
for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their
dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly
asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To
the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet
as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to
the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if
eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s civilities.

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s look
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they
each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhile I can have my mornings to myself,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is enough--I
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s invitation, and if
he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening\xE2\x80\x99s
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat a ball
of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,
a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help
for it, however. Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s happiness and her own were perforce
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy
of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton
once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very
shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.



Chapter 18


Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty
of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose
the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
pleasure in the Bingleys\xE2\x80\x99 invitation to the officers; and though
this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who
told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,
\xE2\x80\x9CI do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\xE2\x80\x9D

This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
him was ecstasy.

She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,
without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her:

\xE2\x80\x9CI dare say you will find him very agreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHeaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
evil.\xE2\x80\x9D

When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours\xE2\x80\x99 looks, their equal amazement in beholding
it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again
silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time
with:--\xE2\x80\x9CIt is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room, or the number of couples.\xE2\x80\x9D

He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.

\xE2\x80\x9CVery well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But
_now_ we may be silent.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBoth,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth archly; \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said he. \xE2\x80\x9CHow near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI must not decide on my own performance.\xE2\x80\x9D

He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, \xE2\x80\x9CWhen you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance.\xE2\x80\x9D

The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said, \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of
_retaining_ them, is less certain.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, \xE2\x80\x9Cand in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at
her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then
flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\xE2\x80\x9D

The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William\xE2\x80\x99s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CSir William\xE2\x80\x99s interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we
are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat think you of books?\xE2\x80\x9D said he, smiling.

\xE2\x80\x9CBooks--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\xE2\x80\x9D said he,
with a look of doubt.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, always,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, \xE2\x80\x9CI remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, with a firm voice.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I ask to what these questions tend?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMerely to the illustration of _your_ character,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. \xE2\x80\x9CI am trying to make it out.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what is your success?\xE2\x80\x9D

She shook her head. \xE2\x80\x9CI do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can readily believe,\xE2\x80\x9D answered he gravely, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\xE2\x80\x9D he coldly replied.
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,
for in Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards
her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.

They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:

\xE2\x80\x9CSo, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!
Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among
his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late
Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to
give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has
always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated
Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but
I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he
cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother
thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent
thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,
Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\xE2\x80\x99s guilt; but really,
considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHis guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Elizabeth angrily; \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
\xE2\x80\x9CExcuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CInsolent girl!\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth to herself. \xE2\x80\x9CYou are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy.\xE2\x80\x9D She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way
before the hope of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s being in the fairest way for happiness.

\xE2\x80\x9CI want to know,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister\xE2\x80\x99s, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane, \xE2\x80\x9CI have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of
his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\xE2\x80\x99s,
Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has
been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s regard.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s sincerity,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth warmly;
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of
both gentlemen as I did before.\xE2\x80\x9D

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have found out,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cby a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady
Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to
do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
I believe him to be Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s _nephew_. It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\xE2\x80\x99nnight.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she
ceased speaking, replied thus:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,
and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that
I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.
Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the
words \xE2\x80\x9Capology,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CHunsford,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CLady Catherine de Bourgh.\xE2\x80\x9D It vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time
to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,
was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have no reason, I assure you,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cto be dissatisfied with my
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\xE2\x80\x9D

As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s two sisters. Her mother\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon
be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but
three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane\xE2\x80\x99s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\xE2\x80\x99s
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor heaven\xE2\x80\x99s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing!\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and
she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,
but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks
of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
Mary\xE2\x80\x99s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was
weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at
Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to
Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs
of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \xE2\x80\x9CThat will do
extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father\xE2\x80\x99s speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Collins, \xE2\x80\x9Cwere so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit
him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family.\xE2\x80\x9D And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many
smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his
wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,
and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably
clever, good kind of young man.

To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though
he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s conversation to herself.

She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s further notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by
a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \xE2\x80\x9CLord,
how tired I am!\xE2\x80\x9D accompanied by a violent yawn.

When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next
day for a short time.

Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.



Chapter 19


The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On
finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,
soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?\xE2\x80\x9D

Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet answered instantly, \xE2\x80\x9COh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy
will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I
want you up stairs.\xE2\x80\x9D And, gathering her work together, she was hastening
away, when Elizabeth called out:

\xE2\x80\x9CDear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse
me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am
going away myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.\xE2\x80\x9D And upon
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
escape, she added: \xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.
Collins.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment\xE2\x80\x99s
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to
conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
they were gone, Mr. Collins began.

\xE2\x80\x9CBelieve me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
mother\xE2\x80\x99s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of
my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\xE2\x80\x9D

The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could
not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,
and he continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will
add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought
to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh\xE2\x80\x99s footstool, that she said, \xE2\x80\x98Mr. Collins, you
must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose
a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\xE2\x80\x99 Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice
and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond
anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not
be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and
I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother\xE2\x80\x99s
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are too hasty, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D she cried. \xE2\x80\x9CYou forget that I have made no
answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not now to learn,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cyour hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWere it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Collins
very gravely--\xE2\x80\x9Cbut I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of
seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may
be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\xE2\x80\x9D And rising as she
thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus
addressed her:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CReally, Mr. Collins,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou puzzle me
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you of its being one.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking
the truth from her heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are uniformly charming!\xE2\x80\x9D cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable.\xE2\x80\x9D

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make
no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if
he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.



Chapter 20


Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will
_make_ her know it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPardon me for interrupting you, madam,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Collins; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut if
she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSir, you quite misunderstand me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \xE2\x80\x9CLizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\xE2\x80\x9D

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library, \xE2\x80\x9COh! Mr. Bennet, you
are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make
Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, when she had
finished her speech. \xE2\x80\x9COf what are you talking?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome here, child,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her father as she appeared. \xE2\x80\x9CI have sent for
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\xE2\x80\x9D Elizabeth replied that it was.
\xE2\x80\x9CVery well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, or I will never see her again.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to
_insist_ upon her marrying him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear,\xE2\x80\x9D replied her husband, \xE2\x80\x9CI have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be.\xE2\x80\x9D

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane
in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother\xE2\x80\x99s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, \xE2\x80\x9CI am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family. \xE2\x80\x9CPray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\xE2\x80\x9D she added in a melancholy tone,
\xE2\x80\x9Cfor nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves.\xE2\x80\x9D

Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CAye, there she comes,\xE2\x80\x9D continued Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Clooking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to
the girls, \xE2\x80\x9CNow, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold
your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation
together.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected
conversation: \xE2\x80\x9COh! Mr. Collins!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear madam,\xE2\x80\x9D replied he, \xE2\x80\x9Clet us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me,\xE2\x80\x9D he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
displeasure, \xE2\x80\x9Cto resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;
and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughter\xE2\x80\x99s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter\xE2\x80\x99s lips instead of your own. But we are all
liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 21


The discussion of Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly
expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke
to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s ill-humour or ill
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.

After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunt\xE2\x80\x99s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI found,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cas the time drew near that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to
her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\xE2\x80\x99s fair, flowing hand; and
Elizabeth saw her sister\xE2\x80\x99s countenance change as she read it, and saw
her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected
herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no
sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,
Jane, taking out the letter, said:

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on
their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You
shall hear what she says.\xE2\x80\x9D

She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a
house. The next was in these words: \xE2\x80\x9CI do not pretend to regret anything
I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;
but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
correspondence. I depend on you for that.\xE2\x80\x9D To these highflown
expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw
nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to
regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is unlucky,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, after a short pause, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCaroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my
dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of
that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of whom we shall deprive you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is evident by this,\xE2\x80\x9D added Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he comes back no more this
winter.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own
master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,
_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think
Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister\xE2\x80\x99s
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman\xE2\x80\x99s heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane as she
finished it. \xE2\x80\x9CIs it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that
Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is
perfectly convinced of her brother\xE2\x80\x99s indifference; and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMost willingly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him
to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane shook her head.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She
is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and
I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cyour
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
herself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must decide for yourself,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cand if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow can you talk so?\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, faintly smiling. \xE2\x80\x9CYou must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!\xE2\x80\x9D

The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline\xE2\x80\x99s
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.

She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane\xE2\x80\x99s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.

They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had
been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two
full courses.



Chapter 22


The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. \xE2\x80\x9CIt keeps him in good
humour,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I am more obliged to you than I can express.\xE2\x80\x9D
 Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
very amiable, but Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her
from any return of Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. Such was Miss Lucas\xE2\x80\x99s scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very
soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

In as short a time as Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.

Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St. James\xE2\x80\x99s. The whole family, in short,
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were
in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible
nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must
be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was
the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,
and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at
the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all
the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship
she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,
and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved
to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.

As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,
said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever
his engagements might allow him to visit them.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear madam,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible.\xE2\x80\x9D

They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said:

\xE2\x80\x9CBut is there not danger of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s disapprobation here, my
good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear sir,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Collins, \xE2\x80\x9CI am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s concurrence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBelieve me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my
cousin Elizabeth.\xE2\x80\x9D

With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

The possibility of Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she could not help crying out:

\xE2\x80\x9CEngaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!\xE2\x80\x9D

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\xE2\x80\x99s good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\xE2\x80\x9D

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her
all imaginable happiness.

\xE2\x80\x9CI see what you are feeling,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Charlotte. \xE2\x80\x9CYou must be surprised,
very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never
was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s
character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth quietly answered \xE2\x80\x9CUndoubtedly;\xE2\x80\x9D and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a
most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
chosen.



Chapter 23


Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but
incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and
often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:

\xE2\x80\x9CGood Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William\xE2\x80\x99s good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.

Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be
happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.

Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!

Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty
and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.

Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,
as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to
their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth\xE2\x80\x99s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.

Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and
they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s continued
absence.

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as
she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s happiness, and so
dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.

As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed
all Jane\xE2\x80\x99s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight
of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
not for the entail, I should not mind it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat should not you mind?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should not mind anything at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\xE2\x80\x99s own
daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!
Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI leave it to yourself to determine,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet.



Chapter 24


Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother\xE2\x80\x99s regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest
of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s praise occupied
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother\xE2\x80\x99s being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.

Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline\xE2\x80\x99s
assertion of her brother\xE2\x80\x99s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,
been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best, but her sister\xE2\x80\x99s was involved in it, as
she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,
on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends\xE2\x80\x99 interference; whether
he had been aware of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister\xE2\x80\x99s situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.

A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying:

\xE2\x80\x9COh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But
I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou doubt me,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Jane, slightly colouring; \xE2\x80\x9Cindeed, you have
no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.\xE2\x80\x9D

With a stronger voice she soon added, \xE2\x80\x9CI have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Jane!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say
to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister\xE2\x80\x99s warm affection.

\xE2\x80\x9CNay,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not
be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the
other is Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is
unaccountable!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s respectability, and
Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody\xE2\x80\x99s sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as
I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him
cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though
it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\xE2\x80\x9D replied
Jane; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd men take care that they should.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s conduct to design,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people\xE2\x80\x99s feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do you impute it to either of those?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, in conjunction with his friend.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can
only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBeyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane;
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother\xE2\x80\x99s. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what
I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in
the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with
less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her
no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s best
comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \xE2\x80\x9CSo, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he one day,
\xE2\x80\x9Cyour sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
all expect Jane\xE2\x80\x99s good fortune.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
the most of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.

Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society
of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.



Chapter 25


After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,
Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his
relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another
letter of thanks.

On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas
at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
They had frequently been staying with her in town.

The first part of Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was
nothing in it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not blame Jane,\xE2\x80\x9D she continued, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s wife by this time, had it not
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,
in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.

When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \xE2\x80\x9CIt
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CI am
sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAn excellent consolation in its way,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it will not
do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut that expression of \xE2\x80\x98violently in love\xE2\x80\x99 is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\xE2\x80\x99s acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s
love?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be
of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister\xE2\x80\x99s ready acquiescence.

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope,\xE2\x80\x9D added Mrs. Gardiner, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such
a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
would hardly think a month\xE2\x80\x99s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe will drop the acquaintance entirely.\xE2\x80\x9D

But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s
attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt\xE2\x80\x99s invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she
hoped by Caroline\xE2\x80\x99s not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.

The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s
warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,
from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and
she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.

To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher
intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
procuring.

Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both
him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and
was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam
Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.



Chapter 26


Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CElizabeth, you are not serious now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father\xE2\x80\x99s opinion of me does
me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,
I will do my best.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs I did the other day,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: \xE2\x80\x9Cvery
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother\xE2\x80\x99s ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope
you are satisfied.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that
she \xE2\x80\x9C_wished_ they might be happy.\xE2\x80\x9D Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she
rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\xE2\x80\x99s ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_That_ you certainly shall.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy father and Maria are coming to me in March,\xE2\x80\x9D added Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I
hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
welcome as either of them.\xE2\x80\x9D

The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on
the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
lost.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy aunt,\xE2\x80\x9D she continued, \xE2\x80\x9Cis going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\xE2\x80\x9D

She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
\xE2\x80\x9CI did not think Caroline in spirits,\xE2\x80\x9D were her words, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached
her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
see them soon here.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\xE2\x80\x99s being in town.

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
prove what she felt.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s regard for me. But, my dear sister,
though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I
receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that
she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not
calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was
in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,
though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out
as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting
wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know
this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily
account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to
his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,
because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said
herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield
again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better
not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on
every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s sister, as by Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.

Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on: \xE2\x80\x9CI am now convinced, my dear aunt, that
I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure
and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and
wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to
think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the
ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 27


With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There
was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s first sketch. She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement
of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.

The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of
what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known Sir William\xE2\x80\x99s too long. He could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
worn out, like his information.

It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin\xE2\x80\x99s appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen
her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,
to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s visit in Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.

Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut my dear Elizabeth,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat sort of girl is Miss King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\xE2\x80\x99s death
made her mistress of this fortune.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
so soon after this event.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Chave it as you choose. _He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTake care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\xE2\x80\x9D

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have not determined how far it shall carry us,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Gardiner,
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut, perhaps, to the Lakes.\xE2\x80\x9D

No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. \xE2\x80\x9COh, my dear,
dear aunt,\xE2\x80\x9D she rapturously cried, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat delight! what felicity! You
give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What
are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport
we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other
travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We
_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.
Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
travellers.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 28


Every object in the next day\xE2\x80\x99s journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
instantly that her cousin\xE2\x80\x99s manners were not altered by his marriage;
his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they
were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife\xE2\x80\x99s
offers of refreshment.

Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its
aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But
though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to
gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her
eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but
in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to
the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the
prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome
modern building, well situated on rising ground.

From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband\xE2\x80\x99s
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.

She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed:

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed
to walk home. Her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s carriages, for she has several.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D added
Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9Cand a most attentive neighbour.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\xE2\x80\x9D

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.

About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened
the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out--

\xE2\x80\x9COh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
haste, and come down this moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in
quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd is this all?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CI expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLa! my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is not
Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;
the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not come in?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI like her appearance,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \xE2\x80\x9CShe
looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
make him a very proper wife.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that
way.

At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.



Chapter 29


Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.

\xE2\x80\x9CI confess,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately
after your arrival!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am the less surprised at what has happened,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Sir William,
\xE2\x80\x9Cfrom that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\xE2\x80\x9D

Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.

When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--

\xE2\x80\x9CDo not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.\xE2\x80\x9D

While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at St. James\xE2\x80\x99s.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.

When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\xE2\x80\x99s alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady
Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
she could witness without trepidation.

From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady
Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,
with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.

In spite of having been at St. James\xE2\x80\x99s, Sir William was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by
silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,
as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.

When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria\xE2\x80\x99s astonishment at her
being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.

After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.

The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had
likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her
ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing
she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to
have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady\xE2\x80\x99s attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse
with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been
her mother\xE2\x80\x99s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then
observed,

\xE2\x80\x9CYour father\xE2\x80\x99s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
sake,\xE2\x80\x9D turning to Charlotte, \xE2\x80\x9CI am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\xE2\x80\x99s family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA little.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COne of them does.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do
you draw?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, not at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat, none of you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot one.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHas your governess left you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe never had any governess.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
the case.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you
must have been neglected.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCompared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,
who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf\xE2\x80\x99s
calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. \xE2\x80\x98Lady
Catherine,\xE2\x80\x99 said she, \xE2\x80\x98you have given me a treasure.\xE2\x80\x99 Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters
must be very young?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be
much in company. But really, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word,\xE2\x80\x9D said her ladyship, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith three younger sisters grown up,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, smiling, \xE2\x80\x9Cyour
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not
conceal your age.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not one-and-twenty.\xE2\x80\x9D

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh\xE2\x80\x99s being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.

When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by
the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins\xE2\x80\x99s side and as many bows on Sir William\xE2\x80\x99s they departed. As soon
as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin
to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for
Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her
commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy
Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s praise
into his own hands.



Chapter 30


Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s being most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,
which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and
had a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99 conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon to get out.

Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s joints of meat were too large for her family.

Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.

The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s reach. This,
however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she
frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s curiosity.

In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not
many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently
destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.

His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his
bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen
them from her husband\xE2\x80\x99s room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:

\xE2\x80\x9CI may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him without saying a word.

Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment\xE2\x80\x99s pause, added:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
happened to see her there?\xE2\x80\x9D

She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.



Chapter 31


Colonel Fitzwilliam\xE2\x80\x99s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen\xE2\x80\x99s arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the
Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen
only at church.

The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s drawing-room. Her ladyship received
them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.

Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,
as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe are speaking of music, madam,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.

\xE2\x80\x9COf music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,
I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\xE2\x80\x99s proficiency.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lady
Catherine; \xE2\x80\x9Cand pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI assure you, madam,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat she does not need such advice.
She practises very constantly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she
will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told
her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
Jenkinson\xE2\x80\x99s room. She would be in nobody\xE2\x80\x99s way, you know, in that part
of the house.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\xE2\x80\x99s ill-breeding, and made
no answer.

When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away
from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer\xE2\x80\x99s
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall not say you are mistaken,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, \xE2\x80\x9CYour cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part
of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to
say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not afraid of you,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, smilingly.

\xE2\x80\x9CPray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. \xE2\x80\x9CI should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced
only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9CI should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \xE2\x80\x9CShall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can answer your question,\xE2\x80\x9D said Fitzwilliam, \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout applying to
him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy,
\xE2\x80\x9Cof conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy fingers,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cdo not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women\xE2\x80\x99s do. They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the
trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman\xE2\x80\x99s of superior execution.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy smiled and said, \xE2\x80\x9CYou are perfectly right. You have employed your
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\xE2\x80\x9D

Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy:

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne\xE2\x80\x99s. Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin\xE2\x80\x99s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.

Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s carriage was
ready to take them all home.



Chapter 32


Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to
be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
to be within.

They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and
feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed:

\xE2\x80\x9CHow very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerfectly so, I thank you.\xE2\x80\x9D

She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
pause added:

\xE2\x80\x9CI think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for
the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
principle.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should not be surprised,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Cif he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.

He took the hint, and soon began with, \xE2\x80\x9CThis seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the
wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAn easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day\xE2\x80\x99s
journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CI should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her family.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\xE2\x80\x9D

As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \xE2\x80\x9C_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you pleased with Kent?\xE2\x80\x9D

A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to anybody, went away.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat can be the meaning of this?\xE2\x80\x9D said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. \xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
have called us in this familiar way.\xE2\x80\x9D

But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\xE2\x80\x99s manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.

But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice
to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
Fitzwilliam\xE2\x80\x99s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend\xE2\x80\x99s dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.


In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.



Chapter 33


More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about
her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s happiness; and that in speaking of
Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel
Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed
her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.

She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\xE2\x80\x99s last letter,
and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw
on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI did not know before that you ever walked this way.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been making the tour of the park,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cas I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
you going much farther?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I should have turned in a moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\xE2\x80\x9D said she.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe likes to have his own way very well,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
\xE2\x80\x9CBut so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it
than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThese are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where
they like.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs this,\xE2\x80\x9D thought Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cmeant for me?\xE2\x80\x9D and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \xE2\x80\x9CAnd pray, what
is the usual price of an earl\xE2\x80\x99s younger son? Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\xE2\x80\x9D

He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat is an advantage which he must
divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.\xE2\x80\x9D

As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he
is a great friend of Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! yes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth drily; \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCare of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
because if it were to get round to the lady\xE2\x80\x99s family, it would be an
unpleasant thing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may depend upon my not mentioning it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing
him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what arts did he use to separate them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe did not talk to me of his own arts,\xE2\x80\x9D said Fitzwilliam, smiling. \xE2\x80\x9CHe
only told me what I have now told you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am thinking of what you have been telling me,\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CYour
cousin\xE2\x80\x99s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend\xE2\x80\x99s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.
But,\xE2\x80\x9D she continued, recollecting herself, \xE2\x80\x9Cas we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is not an unnatural surmise,\xE2\x80\x9D said Fitzwilliam, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousin\xE2\x80\x99s triumph very sadly.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture
of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had
always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was
the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had
suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the
world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere were some very strong objections against the lady,\xE2\x80\x9D were Colonel
Fitzwilliam\xE2\x80\x99s words; and those strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo Jane herself,\xE2\x80\x9D she exclaimed, \xE2\x80\x9Cthere could be no possibility of
objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither
could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and
respectability which he will probably never reach.\xE2\x80\x9D When she thought of
her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow
that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friend\xE2\x80\x99s connections, than from their want of sense;
and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.
Bingley for his sister.

The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s being rather
displeased by her staying at home.



Chapter 34


When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her
a keener sense of her sister\xE2\x80\x99s sufferings. It was some consolation
to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the
next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should
herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her spirits, by all that affection could do.

She could not think of Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s leaving Kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.

While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitated manner, and thus began:

\xE2\x80\x9CIn vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;
and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,
immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.

In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man\xE2\x80\x99s affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she
lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite
of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt
of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but
his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said:

\xE2\x80\x9CIn such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should
be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be
of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance
of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s feelings
dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!
I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI might as well inquire,\xE2\x80\x9D replied she, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against
you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
beloved sister?\xE2\x80\x9D

As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CI have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind.\xE2\x80\x9D

She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

\xE2\x80\x9CCan you deny that you have done it?\xE2\x80\x9D she repeated.

With assumed tranquillity he then replied: \xE2\x80\x9CI have no wish of denying
that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it is not merely this affair,\xE2\x80\x9D she continued, \xE2\x80\x9Con which my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou take an eager interest in that gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s concerns,\xE2\x80\x9D said Darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

\xE2\x80\x9CWho that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHis misfortunes!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Darcy contemptuously; \xE2\x80\x9Cyes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd of your infliction,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth with energy. \xE2\x80\x9CYou have reduced
him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
ridicule.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd this,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
\xE2\x80\x9Cis your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\xE2\x80\x9D added he, stopping in
his walk, and turning towards her, \xE2\x80\x9Cthese offenses might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner.\xE2\x80\x9D

She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
would have tempted me to accept it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of
my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.\xE2\x80\x9D

And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how
to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,
was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for
so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
all the objections which had made him prevent his friend\xE2\x80\x99s marrying
her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his
own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable
pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could
not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.
Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the
sound of Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
encounter Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s observation, and hurried her away to her room.



Chapter 35


Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after
breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.

After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.
Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though
in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,
\xE2\x80\x9CI have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?\xE2\x80\x9D And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.

With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

\xE2\x80\x9CBe not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
demand it of your justice.

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which
is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity
must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.

\xE2\x80\x9CI had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance
at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I
had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
William Lucas\xE2\x80\x99s accidental information, that Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could
be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour
attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss
Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also
watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,
but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
from the evening\xE2\x80\x99s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been
in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not
scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister\xE2\x80\x99s countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be
easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe
her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But
there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still
existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had
myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your
mother\xE2\x80\x99s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say
farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties
was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters\xE2\x80\x99 uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I
described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your
sister\xE2\x80\x99s indifference. He had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was
no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into
Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the
work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not
reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister\xE2\x80\x99s being in
town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her
brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it
was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no
other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister\xE2\x80\x99s feelings, it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
them.

\xE2\x80\x9CWith respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I
am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
than one witness of undoubted veracity.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many
years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at
school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his
own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
been unable to give him a gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s education. My father was not only
fond of this young man\xE2\x80\x99s society, whose manners were always engaging; he
had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be
his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is
many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different
manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,
and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.
Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree
you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham
has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to
Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham
wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,
he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he
could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying
law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed
him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to
his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the
business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him
to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured
me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He
had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was
well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not
have forgotten my revered father\xE2\x80\x99s intentions. You will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every
repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.

\xE2\x80\x9CI must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to
the guardianship of my mother\xE2\x80\x99s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed
for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by
design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and
by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and
to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed
the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and
how I acted. Regard for my sister\xE2\x80\x99s credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s chief object was unquestionably my sister\xE2\x80\x99s fortune, which
is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have
been complete indeed.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he
had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,
detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but
I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our
near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of
the executors of my father\xE2\x80\x99s will, has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_
should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning. I will only add, God bless you.

\xE2\x80\x9CFITZWILLIAM DARCY\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 36


If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation
to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what
had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly
left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister\xE2\x80\x99s insensibility she
instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst
objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing
him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and
insolence.

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \xE2\x80\x9CThis must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\xE2\x80\x9D--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.

In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own
words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the
will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down
the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read
on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As
to his real character, had information been in her power, she had
never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried
to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of
Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years\xE2\x80\x99 continuance. But
no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss
Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin\xE2\x80\x99s affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin\xE2\x80\x99s corroboration.

She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips\xE2\x80\x99s.
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;
that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son.

How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his
actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,
absurd.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow despicably I have acted!\xE2\x80\x9D she cried; \xE2\x80\x9CI, who have prided myself
on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this
discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my
folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sister\xE2\x80\x99s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s
opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his
description of Jane. She felt that Jane\xE2\x80\x99s feelings, though fervent, were
little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air
and manner not often united with great sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.

The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered
that Jane\xE2\x80\x99s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made
her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.

She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern
in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object; she could think only of her letter.



Chapter 37


The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.

Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s indignation would have been. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat would she have said? how
would she have behaved?\xE2\x80\x9D were questions with which she amused herself.

Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. \xE2\x80\x9CI assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lady Catherine; \xE2\x80\x9CI believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to
me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The
dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His
attachment to Rosings certainly increases.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\xE2\x80\x9D replied
Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
next Saturday.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lady Catherine seemed resigned. \xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Collins, you must send a servant
with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.
You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my
niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of
Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those
things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I
am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy uncle is to send a servant for us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?
Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
attended to.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary
walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.

Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother\xE2\x80\x99s indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there
forever.

Anxiety on Jane\xE2\x80\x99s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved
to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!

When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.



Chapter 38


On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know not, Miss Elizabeth,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
solemnity replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CIt gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,
from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to
Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You
see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are
sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\xE2\x80\x9D

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so. Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
other.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she
had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that
her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her
home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their
dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut,\xE2\x80\x9D he added, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood gracious!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Maria, after a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99 silence, \xE2\x80\x9Cit seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA great many indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D said her companion with a sigh.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth added privately, \xE2\x80\x9CAnd how much I shall have to conceal!\xE2\x80\x9D

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s
house, where they were to remain a few days.

Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s proposals. To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried
into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister
further.



Chapter 39


It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s carriage
was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman\xE2\x80\x99s
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.

After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
\xE2\x80\x9CIs not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd we mean to treat you all,\xE2\x80\x9D added Lydia, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.\xE2\x80\x9D Then, showing
her purchases--\xE2\x80\x9CLook here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better.\xE2\x80\x9D

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, \xE2\x80\x9COh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre they indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;
and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to
go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D thought Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9C_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow I have got some news for you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lydia, as they sat down at
table. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about
a certain person we all like!\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CAye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
There is no danger of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s marrying Mary King. There\xE2\x80\x99s for you! She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Mary King is safe!\xE2\x80\x9D added Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Csafe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled
thing?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!

As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty\xE2\x80\x99s and
Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s purchases, were seated in it.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow nicely we are all crammed in,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Lydia. \xE2\x80\x9CI am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you can\xE2\x80\x99t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster\xE2\x80\x99s. Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\xE2\x80\x99s clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\xE2\x80\x9D

With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty\xE2\x80\x99s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s name.

Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\xE2\x80\x9D

Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that
occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat
some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\xE2\x80\x99s,
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Mary,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there
was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty
had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved
very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated
you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never
should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then
we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off!\xE2\x80\x9D

To this Mary very gravely replied, \xE2\x80\x9CFar be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for
_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.\xE2\x80\x9D

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.
Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The
comfort to _her_ of the regiment\xE2\x80\x99s approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.

She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.



Chapter 40


Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every
particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be
surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
between Mr. Darcy and herself.

Miss Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister\xE2\x80\x99s refusal must have given him.

\xE2\x80\x9CHis being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cand certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9CI am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBlame you! Oh, no.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
day.\xE2\x80\x9D

She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear the one without involving the other.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis will not do,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s;
but you shall do as you choose.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not know when I have been more shocked,\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CWickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing
of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPoor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one\xE2\x80\x99s genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say
that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I
had! Oh! how I wanted you!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There
is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s character.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \xE2\x80\x9CSurely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me
to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy
is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal
to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At
present I will say nothing about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\xE2\x80\x9D

The tumult of Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other
half of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one
could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd then,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cif that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to
tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!\xE2\x80\x9D

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister\xE2\x80\x99s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself
in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,
and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first
attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,
and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her
attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
health and their tranquillity.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet one day, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s? For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But
I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is
a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there\xE2\x80\x99s the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of
his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I
would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\xE2\x80\x9D

But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D continued her mother, soon afterwards, \xE2\x80\x9Cand so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her
mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, nothing at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as
quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was a subject which they could not mention before me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 41


The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the regiment\xE2\x80\x99s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?\xE2\x80\x9D would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \xE2\x80\x9CHow can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years
ago.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI cried for two days together when Colonel
Miller\xE2\x80\x99s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure I shall break _mine_,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lydia.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf one could but go to Brighton!\xE2\x80\x9D observed Mrs. Bennet.

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\xE2\x80\x9D
 added Kitty.

Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.

But the gloom of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of
the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months\xE2\x80\x99 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\xE2\x80\x99s feelings, Lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\xE2\x80\x99s
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said she, \xE2\x80\x9CThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\xE2\x80\x9D

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:

\xE2\x80\x9CLydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you were aware,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cof the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s unguarded and
imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAlready arisen?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Mr. Bennet. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat, has she frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s folly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger
Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply:

\xE2\x80\x9CDo not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
of her life.\xE2\x80\x9D

With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on
them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret
over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.

Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. In Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.

Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have
been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
conviction of her husband\xE2\x80\x99s never intending to go there himself.

But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s leaving
home.

Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.

On the very last day of the regiment\xE2\x80\x99s remaining at Meryton, he dined,
with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\xE2\x80\x99s and Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.

He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\xE2\x80\x99s
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:

\xE2\x80\x9CHow long did you say he was at Rosings?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNearly three weeks.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you saw him frequently?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, almost every day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHis manners are very different from his cousin\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd
pray, may I ask?--\xE2\x80\x9D But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, \xE2\x80\x9CIs
it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,\xE2\x80\x9D he continued in a lower
and more serious tone, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he is improved in essentials.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, no!\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CIn essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was.\xE2\x80\x9D

While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added:

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\xE2\x80\x9D

Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been
alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always
operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I
am certain he has very much at heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his
side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.

When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in
the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.



Chapter 42


Had Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been
looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it is fortunate,\xE2\x80\x9D thought she, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I have something to wish for.
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister\xE2\x80\x99s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation.\xE2\x80\x9D

When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to
the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still
less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public.

After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of
June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by
the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.

The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.

Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. \xE2\x80\x9CBut surely,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\xE2\x80\x9D

The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt\xE2\x80\x99s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the
next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.

It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s
former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,
Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not
in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much?\xE2\x80\x9D said her aunt; \xE2\x80\x9Ca place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so
many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \xE2\x80\x9CIf it were merely a fine house
richly furnished,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI should not care about it myself; but
the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
country.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its
proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.



Chapter 43


Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.

The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which
they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,
was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and
she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,
with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be
seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of
his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd of this place,\xE2\x80\x9D thought she, \xE2\x80\x9CI might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,\xE2\x80\x9D--recollecting
herself--\xE2\x80\x9Cthat could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like
regret.

She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question
was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.
Reynolds replied that he was, adding, \xE2\x80\x9CBut we expect him to-morrow, with
a large party of friends.\xE2\x80\x9D How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the
likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman, the son of her late master\xE2\x80\x99s steward, who had been brought
up by him at his own expense. \xE2\x80\x9CHe is now gone into the army,\xE2\x80\x9D she added;
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd that,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
\xE2\x80\x9Cis my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have heard much of your master\xE2\x80\x99s fine person,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture; \xE2\x80\x9Cit is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.

\xE2\x80\x9CDoes that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth coloured, and said: \xE2\x80\x9CA little.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\xE2\x80\x99am?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, very handsome.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
master\xE2\x80\x99s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. He was very fond of them.\xE2\x80\x9D

This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s being among them.

Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Gardiner.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CExcept,\xE2\x80\x9D thought Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen she goes to Ramsgate.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf your master would marry, you might see more of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
good enough for him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \xE2\x80\x9CIt is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,\xE2\x80\x9D
 replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \xE2\x80\x9CI have
never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever
since he was four years old.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was
grateful to her uncle for saying:

\xE2\x80\x9CThere are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
having such a master.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could
not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and
he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
world.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth almost stared at her. \xE2\x80\x9CCan this be Mr. Darcy?\xE2\x80\x9D thought she.

\xE2\x80\x9CHis father was an excellent man,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Gardiner.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is the best landlord, and the best master,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat ever
lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw
anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away
like other young men.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn what an amiable light does this place him!\xE2\x80\x9D thought Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis fine account of him,\xE2\x80\x9D whispered her aunt as they walked, \xE2\x80\x9Cis not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps we might be deceived.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is not very likely; our authority was too good.\xE2\x80\x9D

On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when
last at Pemberley.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is certainly a good brother,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.

Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s delight, when she should enter
the room. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd this is always the way with him,\xE2\x80\x9D she added. \xE2\x80\x9CWhatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There
is nothing he would not do for her.\xE2\x80\x9D

The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were
all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.

In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested
her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest
contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\xE2\x80\x99s
lifetime.

There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people\xE2\x80\x99s happiness were in his guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his
eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.

When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.

As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.

They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.

She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener\xE2\x80\x99s expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent
had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in
Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.

At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.

The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but
Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,
followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her
coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the
world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely
thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he
thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;
for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted
from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly
altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was
amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What
a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put
his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account
for it.

They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and
seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.

At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the
valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading
many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.
With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which
brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,
to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed
it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the
valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the
bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the
man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before
they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared
for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words \xE2\x80\x9Cdelightful,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Ccharming,\xE2\x80\x9D when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,
and she said no more.

Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat will be his surprise,\xE2\x80\x9D thought
she, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of
fashion.\xE2\x80\x9D

The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and
so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.

The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time
to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment
must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and
continually was she repeating, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy is he so altered? From what can
it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his
manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a
change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\xE2\x80\x9D

After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated
in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband\xE2\x80\x99s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--\xE2\x80\x9Cfor your housekeeper,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cinformed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country.\xE2\x80\x9D He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \xE2\x80\x9CThey
will join me early to-morrow,\xE2\x80\x9D he continued, \xE2\x80\x9Cand among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s name had been the last
mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_
mind was not very differently engaged.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is also one other person in the party,\xE2\x80\x9D he continued after a
pause, \xE2\x80\x9Cwho more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?\xE2\x80\x9D

The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.

They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected
that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was
over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house.

The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
\xE2\x80\x9CHe is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\xE2\x80\x9D said her uncle.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,\xE2\x80\x9D replied her
aunt, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
have seen nothing of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo be sure, Lizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said her aunt, \xE2\x80\x9Che is not so handsome as Wickham;
or, rather, he has not Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s countenance, for his features
are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so
disagreeable?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\xE2\x80\x9D replied
her uncle. \xE2\x80\x9CYour great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off
his grounds.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but
said nothing.

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom what we have seen of him,\xE2\x80\x9D continued Mrs. Gardiner, \xE2\x80\x9CI really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal
master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every
virtue.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in
as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from
his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning\xE2\x80\x99s walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
intercourse renewed after many years\xE2\x80\x99 discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s civility, and, above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.



Chapter 44


Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite
amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.

Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.

Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.

They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley
was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s quick
step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked
and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.

To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love. Of the lady\xE2\x80\x99s sensations they remained a little
in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.

Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and
to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.

In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point
she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a
recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed
to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone
which had something of real regret, that it \xE2\x80\x9Cwas a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her;\xE2\x80\x9D and, before she could reply,
he added, \xE2\x80\x9CIt is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of
November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.

It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;
but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was
so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations
at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance
could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.

Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.

Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant\xE2\x80\x99s report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town
where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She
certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in
his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.
It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid
her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most
eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display
of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only
were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent
on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent
love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,
she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her
fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of
his addresses.

It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s in coming to see them on the
very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a
late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when
she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.



Chapter 45


Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how
much civility on that lady\xE2\x80\x99s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.

On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London. Georgiana\xE2\x80\x99s reception of them was very civil, but attended with
all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear
of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,
however, did her justice, and pitied her.

By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.

Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected
them round the table.

While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.

He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother\xE2\x80\x99s
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:

\xE2\x80\x9CPray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family.\xE2\x80\x9D

In Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s presence she dared not mention Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment\xE2\x80\x99s distress;
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While
she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s
meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very
wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.

Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s person,
behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\xE2\x80\x99s
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not
err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\xE2\x80\x9D she
cried; \xE2\x80\x9CI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing
that we should not have known her again.\xE2\x80\x9D

However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.

\xE2\x80\x9CFor my own part,\xE2\x80\x9D she rejoined, \xE2\x80\x9CI must confess that I never could
see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose
wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,
which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do
not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable.\xE2\x80\x9D

Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CI remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, \xE2\x80\x98_She_
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.\xE2\x80\x99 But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut _that_
was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\xE2\x80\x9D

He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but
himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece\xE2\x80\x99s
beginning the subject.



Chapter 46


Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:

\xE2\x80\x9CSince writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing
to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step
(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against
him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
know what I have written.\xE2\x80\x9D

Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

\xE2\x80\x9CBy this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest
Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,
and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham
and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the
day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s short
letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna
Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was
repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.
intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,
but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney
coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that
is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.
I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that
side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but
without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With
the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions
to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved
for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our
distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the
worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make
it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a
young woman of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that
Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his
head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to
be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she
exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And
as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has
anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of
confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the
first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not
so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I
take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but
circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to
come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,
that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something
more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel
Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure
I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any
measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to
be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my
uncle\xE2\x80\x99s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will
immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! where, where is my uncle?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing
a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,
she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s situation,
hastily exclaimed, \xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not
an instant to lose.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood God! what is the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, \xE2\x80\x9CI will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless
an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly.

On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
\xE2\x80\x9CLet me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I thank you,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \xE2\x80\x9CThere
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\xE2\x80\x9D

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence. At length she spoke again. \xE2\x80\x9CI have just had a letter from Jane,
with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger
sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into
the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no
connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy was fixed in astonishment. \xE2\x80\x9CWhen I consider,\xE2\x80\x9D she added in a yet
more agitated voice, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I might have prevented it! I, who knew what
he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I
learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
have happened. But it is all--all too late now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am grieved indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Darcy; \xE2\x80\x9Cgrieved--shocked. But is it
certain--absolutely certain?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle\xE2\x80\x99s
immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But
nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is
such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much. Wretched, wretched mistake!\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her
power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.

But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed
up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I
fear, prevent my sister\xE2\x80\x99s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley
to-day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\xE2\x80\x9D

He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting look, went away.

As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full
of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him
go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. Never, since reading Jane\xE2\x80\x99s second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first
letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose
Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.

She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
feel it!

She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle\xE2\x80\x99s interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant\xE2\x80\x99s
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them
instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a
favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every
assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked
him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to
be off as soon as possible. \xE2\x80\x9CBut what is to be done about Pemberley?\xE2\x80\x9D
 cried Mrs. Gardiner. \xE2\x80\x9CJohn told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for
us; was it so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_That_ is all settled.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is all settled?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\xE2\x80\x9D

But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.



Chapter 47


\xE2\x80\x9CI have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\xE2\x80\x9D said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; \xE2\x80\x9Cand really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel\xE2\x80\x99s family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you really think so?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

\xE2\x80\x9CUpon my word,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Gardiner, \xE2\x80\x9CI begin to be of your uncle\xE2\x80\x99s
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other
neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I
dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been
the case?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn the first place,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Gardiner, \xE2\x80\x9Cthere is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular
friend, you see by Jane\xE2\x80\x99s account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has
no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\xE2\x80\x99s
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat a sister\xE2\x80\x99s sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,
nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you see that Jane,\xE2\x80\x9D said her aunt, \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes not think so very ill of
Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do you really know all this?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, colouring. \xE2\x80\x9CI told you, the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight\xE2\x80\x99s time. As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could
it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was
settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening
her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
enough from my thoughts.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\xE2\x80\x9D

                          * * * * *

It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night
on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.

The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her
mother\xE2\x80\x99s apartment, immediately met her.

Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot yet,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane. \xE2\x80\x9CBut now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
everything will be well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs my father in town?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd have you heard from him often?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd my mother--how is she? How are you all?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven, are quite well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you--how are you?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CYou look pale. How much you
must have gone through!\xE2\x80\x9D

Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of
good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.

Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes\xE2\x80\x99
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must principally be owing.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I had been able,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cto carry my point in going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!
And now here\xE2\x80\x99s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,
wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become
of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we
shall do.\xE2\x80\x9D

They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo not give way to useless alarm,\xE2\x80\x9D added he; \xE2\x80\x9Cthough it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we
may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make
him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear brother,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat is exactly what I
could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my
wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such
spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does
not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I
know you will contrive it all.\xE2\x80\x9D

But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well
in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on
the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.

Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.

In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
\xE2\x80\x9CUnhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one
false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed
to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
the subject, by saying, \xE2\x80\x9CBut tell me all and everything about it which
I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CColonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of
their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt
a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister\xE2\x80\x99s happiness with him
in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s last letter
she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other, many weeks.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut not before they went to Brighton?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I believe not.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does
he know his real character?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;
but I hope this may be false.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps it would have been better,\xE2\x80\x9D replied her sister. \xE2\x80\x9CBut to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCould Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s note to his
wife?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe brought it with him for us to see.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents:

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR HARRIET,

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,
I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I
love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think
it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my
going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,
when I write to them and sign my name \xE2\x80\x98Lydia Wickham.\xE2\x80\x99 What a good joke
it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to
Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will
dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall
send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell
Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
drink to our good journey.

\xE2\x80\x9CYour affectionate friend,

\xE2\x80\x9CLYDIA BENNET.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their
journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her
side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Jane,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cwas there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so
much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And
Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters\xE2\x80\x99, if
they should be of use to us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe had better have stayed at home,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cperhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see
too little of one\xE2\x80\x99s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.\xE2\x80\x9D

She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe meant I believe,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cto go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady\xE2\x80\x99s removing from one carriage into another might
be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 48


The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,
to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband\xE2\x80\x99s not being killed in a duel.

Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.

All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman\xE2\x80\x99s family.
Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister\xE2\x80\x99s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less
of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of
them.

Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a
letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;
that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,
but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised
to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:

\xE2\x80\x9CI have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man\xE2\x80\x99s intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,
Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any
other person.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never
heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both
of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of
his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application
was a something to look forward to.

Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters
was the grand object of every morning\xE2\x80\x99s impatience. Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
follows:

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR SIR,

\xE2\x80\x9CI feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in
your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that
may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parent\xE2\x80\x99s mind. The death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to
be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,
for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think
that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be
guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,
you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined
by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to
whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,
will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event
of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to
console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her
own heinous offense.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am, dear sir, etc., etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he
kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one
living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he
had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the
wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s relations, for
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.
He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more
formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \xE2\x80\x9CA gamester!\xE2\x80\x9D
 she cried. \xE2\x80\x9CThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded
to his brother-in-law\xE2\x80\x99s entreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\xE2\x80\x9D she cried. \xE2\x80\x9CSure he
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?\xE2\x80\x9D

As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.

Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and
the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their
being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.

The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.

When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.

It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, \xE2\x80\x9CSay
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must not be too severe upon yourself,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone
to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you suppose them to be in London?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; where else can they be so well concealed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Lydia used to want to go to London,\xE2\x80\x9D added Kitty.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is happy then,\xE2\x80\x9D said her father drily; \xE2\x80\x9Cand her residence there
will probably be of some duration.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then after a short silence he continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me
last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother\xE2\x80\x99s
tea.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a parade,\xE2\x80\x9D he cried, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhich does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not going to run away, papa,\xE2\x80\x9D said Kitty fretfully. \xE2\x80\x9CIf I should
ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into
my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be
absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\xE2\x80\x9D

Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, well,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cdo not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 49


Two days after Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDear madam,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half-hour, and master has had a letter.\xE2\x80\x9D

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said:

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you are looking for my master, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, he is walking towards the
little copse.\xE2\x80\x9D

Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once
more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out:

\xE2\x80\x9COh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes I have had a letter from him by express.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, and what news does it bring--good or bad?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is there of good to be expected?\xE2\x80\x9D said he, taking the letter from
his pocket. \xE2\x80\x9CBut perhaps you would like to read it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.

\xE2\x80\x9CRead it aloud,\xE2\x80\x9D said their father, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I hardly know myself what it is
about.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR BROTHER,

\xE2\x80\x9CAt last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,
upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you
left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough
to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen it is as I always hoped,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Jane; \xE2\x80\x9Cthey are married!\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth read on:

\xE2\x80\x9CI have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there
was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,
during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,
as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there
will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to
settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude
will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to
Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at
Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as
fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope
you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,

\xE2\x80\x9CEDW. GARDINER.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it possible?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \xE2\x80\x9CCan it be
possible that he will marry her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\xE2\x80\x9D said her
sister. \xE2\x80\x9CMy dear father, I congratulate you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd have you answered the letter?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; but it must be done soon.\xE2\x80\x9D

Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear father,\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, \xE2\x80\x9Ccome back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet me write for you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you dislike the trouble
yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI dislike it very much,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it must be done.\xE2\x80\x9D

And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd may I ask--\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CComplied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever
to pay him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMoney! My uncle!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat do you mean, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is very true,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cthough it had not occurred to me
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
it must be my uncle\xE2\x80\x99s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said her father; \xE2\x80\x9CWickham\xE2\x80\x99s a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd they are really to be married!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. \xE2\x80\x9CHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI comfort myself with thinking,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he certainly would
not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf he were ever able to learn what Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s debts have been,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cand how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Jane: \xE2\x80\x9CI hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to
marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTheir conduct has been such,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cas neither you, nor
I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly
replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CJust as you please.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay we take my uncle\xE2\x80\x99s letter to read to her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTake whatever you like, and get away.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s hope of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s being soon
married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, dear Lydia!\xE2\x80\x9D she cried. \xE2\x80\x9CThis is delightful indeed! She will
be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!
My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage
everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him
how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!\xE2\x80\x9D

Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour laid them all under.

\xE2\x80\x9CFor we must attribute this happy conclusion,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cin a great
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist Mr. Wickham with money.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cit is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!
In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can\xE2\x80\x99t write; so I will dictate, and
you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\xE2\x80\x9D

She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day\xE2\x80\x99s delay, she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.

\xE2\x80\x9CI will go to Meryton,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cas soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call
on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.

Poor Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was
no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had
feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had
gained.



Chapter 50


Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place.

He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s birth, had been certain that he
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then
too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband\xE2\x80\x99s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,
though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother\xE2\x80\x99s hands, Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s expenses had been very little within
that sum.

That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick
in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any
message to her.

The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant
farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery
was considered certain.

It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object
of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

\xE2\x80\x9CHaye Park might do,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cif the Gouldings could quit it--or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: \xE2\x80\x9CMrs.
Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\xE2\x80\x9D

A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter\xE2\x80\x99s nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
took place.

Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.

She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister\xE2\x80\x99s
frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,
there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other
objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.

From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.

What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.

She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she
must have received benefit of greater importance.

But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.

                          * * * * *

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was greatly my wish that he should do so,\xE2\x80\x9D he added, \xE2\x80\x9Cas soon as
his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on
his account and my niece\xE2\x80\x99s. It is Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s intention to go into
the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
ensigncy in General ----\xE2\x80\x98s regiment, now quartered in the North. It
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I
have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I
hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,
and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and her mother.--Yours, etc.,

\xE2\x80\x9CE. GARDINER.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s removal
from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet
was not so well pleased with it. Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s being settled in the North,
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,
for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cit will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----\xE2\x80\x98s
regiment.\xE2\x80\x9D

His daughter\xE2\x80\x99s request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\xE2\x80\x99s feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent
his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as
the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was
surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and
had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would
have been the last object of her wishes.



Chapter 51


Their sister\xE2\x80\x99s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to
meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure.

They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,
to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.

Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet
was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.

Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.

There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

\xE2\x80\x9COnly think of its being three months,\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, \xE2\x80\x9Csince I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \xE2\x80\x9COh! mamma, do the
people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he
should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took
off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that
he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother\xE2\x80\x99s right hand, and hear her say
to her eldest sister, \xE2\x80\x9CAh! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and
all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Wickham\xE2\x80\x9D
 by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her
ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, mamma,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, \xE2\x80\x9Cand what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half
my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don\xE2\x80\x99t
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should like it beyond anything!\xE2\x80\x9D said her mother.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thank you for my share of the favour,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands.\xE2\x80\x9D

Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.

Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected
to find it; not equal to Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s for him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.

Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.

One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You
were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo really,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9CI think there cannot be too little said
on the subject.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLa! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement\xE2\x80\x99s, because Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s lodgings were in
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o\xE2\x80\x99clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to
put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was
my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you\xE2\x80\x99ll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was
rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so
just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once
they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I
did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he
came back again in ten minutes\xE2\x80\x99 time, and then we all set out. However,
I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf it was to be secret,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane, \xE2\x80\x9Csay not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! certainly,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \xE2\x80\x9Cwe will
ask you no questions.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Lydia, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry.\xE2\x80\x9D

On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.

But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least
it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at
her sister\xE2\x80\x99s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may readily comprehend,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems
to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot that I _shall_, though,\xE2\x80\x9D she added to herself, as she finished
the letter; \xE2\x80\x9Cand my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane\xE2\x80\x99s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad
of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.



Chapter 52


Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it
than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to
be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.

\xE2\x80\x9CGracechurch street, Sept. 6.

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR NIECE,

\xE2\x80\x9CI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise
what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don\xE2\x80\x99t think me angry,
however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to
understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised
as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really
innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.

\xE2\x80\x9COn the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several
hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.
Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,
and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,
Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He
called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_
motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days
in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to
direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large
house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with
Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and
corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.
Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had
she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up
their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the
wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and
afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he
acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But
he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared
for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear
of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,
it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,
in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never
been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,
on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and
scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s flight on her
own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as
to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He
must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
nothing to live on.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though
Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able
to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
reasonable.

\xE2\x80\x9CEvery thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be
seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was
still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge
your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.

\xE2\x80\x9COn Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,
and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all
settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been
accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and
I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey battled it together for a long time, which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle
was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation
that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane
at most.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young
people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably
more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own
settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all
this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It
was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that
Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he
had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth
in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody\xE2\x80\x99s_ reserve,
can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,
my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another
interest_ in the affair.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who
were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in
London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were
then to receive the last finish.

\xE2\x80\x9CI believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I
knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was
satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not
perceived, by Jane\xE2\x80\x99s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell
you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she
heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and
Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,
attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave
town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my
dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His
understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little
more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach
him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But
slyness seems the fashion.

\xE2\x80\x9CPray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
pair of ponies, would be the very thing.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
hour.

\xE2\x80\x9CYours, very sincerely,

\xE2\x80\x9CM. GARDINER.\xE2\x80\x9D

The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\xE2\x80\x99s
match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason
with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for
a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law
of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,
to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had
given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she
could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For
herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.
She read over her aunt\xE2\x80\x99s commendation of him again and again. It
was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some
pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she
and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between Mr. Darcy and herself.

She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one\xE2\x80\x99s
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\xE2\x80\x9D said he,
as he joined her.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou certainly do,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied with a smile; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and
now we are better.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue. Are the others coming out?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley.\xE2\x80\x9D

She replied in the affirmative.

\xE2\x80\x9CI almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, she did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what did she say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CIt must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUndoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; he introduced us to his sister.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do you like her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery much.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you go by the village of Kympton?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not recollect that we did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow should you have liked making sermons?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CExceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,
and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister\xE2\x80\x99s sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let
us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.



Chapter 53


Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.

The day of his and Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear Lydia,\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen shall we meet again?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, lord! I don\xE2\x80\x99t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWrite to me very often, my dear.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
do.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Wickham\xE2\x80\x99s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife\xE2\x80\x99s. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is as fine a fellow,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, \xE2\x80\x9Cas ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to
us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\xE2\x80\x9D

The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.

\xE2\x80\x9CI often think,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat there is nothing so bad as parting with
one\xE2\x80\x99s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CIt must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,
but only because her husband\xE2\x80\x99s regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\xE2\x80\x9D

But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
smiled and shook her head by turns.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\xE2\x80\x9D (for Mrs.
Phillips first brought her the news). \xE2\x80\x9CWell, so much the better. Not
that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am
sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome
to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may depend on it,\xE2\x80\x9D replied the other, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor Mrs. Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
going to the butcher\xE2\x80\x99s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:

\xE2\x80\x9CI saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don\xE2\x80\x99t imagine it was from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
_myself_, but I dread other people\xE2\x80\x99s remarks.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend\xE2\x80\x99s permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.

\xE2\x80\x9CYet it is hard,\xE2\x80\x9D she sometimes thought, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.

The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou
will wait on him of course.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\xE2\x80\x99s errand again.\xE2\x80\x9D

His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Tis an etiquette I despise,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CIf he wants our society,
let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. But, however, that shan\xE2\x80\x99t prevent my asking him to dine here, I
am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband\xE2\x80\x99s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--

\xE2\x80\x9CI begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane to her sister. \xE2\x80\x9CIt
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish I could say anything to comfort you,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it
is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock and ride towards the house.

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is a gentleman with him, mamma,\xE2\x80\x9D said Kitty; \xE2\x80\x9Cwho can it be?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSome acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLa!\xE2\x80\x9D replied Kitty, \xE2\x80\x9Cit looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. what\xE2\x80\x99s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s friend, without being heard by either
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.

The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.

\xE2\x80\x9CLet me first see how he behaves,\xE2\x80\x9D said she; \xE2\x80\x9Cit will then be early
enough for expectation.\xE2\x80\x9D

She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
gentlemen\xE2\x80\x99s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.

Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother\xE2\x80\x99s
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.

Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.

Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.

Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He
was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,
when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.

\xE2\x80\x9CCould I expect it to be otherwise!\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CYet why did he come?\xE2\x80\x9D

She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.

She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet.

He readily agreed to it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my
own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, \xE2\x80\x98Lately,
George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\xE2\x80\x99 without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
It was my brother Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\xE2\x80\x9D

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\xE2\x80\x9D
 continued her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay
I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have
heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D said her mother,
\xE2\x80\x9CI beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe first wish of my heart,\xE2\x80\x9D said she to herself, \xE2\x80\x9Cis never more to
be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!\xE2\x80\x9D

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and
as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement.\xE2\x80\x9D

Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.

Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.



Chapter 54


As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour astonished and vexed her.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\xE2\x80\x9D said she,
\xE2\x80\x9Cdid he come at all?\xE2\x80\x9D

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If
he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will
think no more about him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, very indifferent indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, laughingly. \xE2\x80\x9COh, Jane,
take care.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

                          * * * * *

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour\xE2\x80\x99s visit, had
revived.

On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore
to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. He placed himself by her.

Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.

His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane\xE2\x80\x99s happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother\xE2\x80\x99s ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind;
and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
family.

She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious
and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf he does not come to me, _then_,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI shall give him up for
ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen\xE2\x80\x99s approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:

\xE2\x80\x9CThe men shan\xE2\x80\x99t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
do we?\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!

\xE2\x80\x9CA man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\xE2\x80\x9D

She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:

\xE2\x80\x9CIs your sister at Pemberley still?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, she will remain there till Christmas.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks.\xE2\x80\x9D

She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady\xE2\x80\x99s whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.

When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother\xE2\x80\x99s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell girls,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucases\xE2\x80\x99 last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
what do you think she said besides? \xE2\x80\x98Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last.\xE2\x80\x99 She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt has been a very agreeable day,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CThe
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet again.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth smiled.

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are very cruel,\xE2\x80\x9D said her sister, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow hard it is in some cases to be believed!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd how impossible in others!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 55


A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

\xE2\x80\x9CNext time you call,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI hope we shall be more lucky.\xE2\x80\x9D

He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.

\xE2\x80\x9CCan you come to-morrow?\xE2\x80\x9D

Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.

He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\xE2\x80\x99s room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy\xE2\x80\x99s hair.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe will be down as soon as we can,\xE2\x80\x9D said Jane; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
Where is your sash, my dear?\xE2\x80\x9D

But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.

The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of
the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is the matter mamma? What do
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\xE2\x80\x9D She then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \xE2\x80\x9CCome here, my love, I want to
speak to you,\xE2\x80\x9D took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look
at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her
entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.
Bennet half-opened the door and called out:

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was forced to go.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe may as well leave them by themselves you know;\xE2\x80\x9D said her mother, as
soon as she was in the hall. \xE2\x80\x9CKitty and I are going up stairs to sit in
my dressing-room.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.

Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.

He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s
concurrence.

Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent
the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother\xE2\x80\x99s schemes.

But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would
have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.

Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Tis too much!\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cby far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
why is not everybody as happy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,
a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said for the present.

\xE2\x80\x9CI must go instantly to my mother;\xE2\x80\x9D she cried. \xE2\x80\x9CI would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!\xE2\x80\x9D

She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd this,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cis the end of all his friend\xE2\x80\x99s anxious
circumspection! of all his sister\xE2\x80\x99s falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\xE2\x80\x9D

In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere is your sister?\xE2\x80\x9D said he hastily, as he opened the door.

\xE2\x80\x9CWith my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.\xE2\x80\x9D

He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\xE2\x80\x99s perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.

It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter, and said:

\xE2\x80\x9CJane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are a good girl;\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CExceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D cried his wife, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more.\xE2\x80\x9D Then addressing her daughter, \xE2\x80\x9COh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I shan\xE2\x80\x99t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!\xE2\x80\x9D

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
obliged to accept.

Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he
always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe has made me so happy,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, one evening, \xE2\x80\x9Cby telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
it possible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI suspected as much,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CBut how did he account for
it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt must have been his sister\xE2\x80\x99s doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is the most unforgiving speech,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s pretended regard.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWould you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty.\xE2\x80\x9D

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased
to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,
though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\xE2\x80\x9D cried
Jane. \xE2\x80\x9COh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\xE2\x80\x9D

The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,
and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.

The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.



Chapter 56


One morning, about a week after Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.

Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, madam,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
\xE2\x80\x9CShe is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man
who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have a very small park here,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then
added:

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGo, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D cried her mother, \xE2\x80\x9Cand show her ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.

Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow could I ever think her like her nephew?\xE2\x80\x9D said she, as she looked in
her face.

As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

\xE2\x80\x9CYou can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bennet,\xE2\x80\x9D replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved
on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you believed it impossible to be true,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, \xE2\x80\x9CI wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth
coolly, \xE2\x80\x9Cwill be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never heard that it was.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,
ever induce me to be explicit.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLet me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnly this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:

\xE2\x80\x9CThe engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest
hours he was destined for his cousin?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not
be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThese are heavy misfortunes,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CBut the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CObstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will
I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person\xE2\x80\x99s
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C_That_ will make your ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father\xE2\x80\x99s, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,
or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in
which you have been brought up.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s daughter; so far we are
equal.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue. You _are_ a gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s daughter. But who was your mother?
Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhatever my connections may be,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cif your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\xE2\x80\x9D

Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment\xE2\x80\x99s deliberation:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not.\xE2\x80\x9D

Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will make no promise of the kind.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that
I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance I require.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their
marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would
my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if
you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister\xE2\x80\x99s infamous
elopement. I know it all; that the young man\xE2\x80\x99s marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
such a girl to be my nephew\xE2\x80\x99s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his
late father\xE2\x80\x99s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are
you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou can now have nothing further to say,\xE2\x80\x9D she resentfully answered.
\xE2\x80\x9CYou have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house.\xE2\x80\x9D

And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are then resolved to have him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNeither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Chave any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment\xE2\x80\x99s
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.
I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.\xE2\x80\x9D

In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, \xE2\x80\x9CI take no leave
of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve
no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe did not choose it,\xE2\x80\x9D said her daughter, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe would go.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were
well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.



Chapter 57


The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report
of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours
at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time.

In revolving Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9CI shall know how to understand
it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all.\xE2\x80\x9D

                          * * * * *

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.

The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI was going to look for you; come into my room.\xE2\x80\x9D

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it
might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.

She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He
then said,

\xE2\x80\x9CI have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.\xE2\x80\x9D

The colour now rushed into Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued:

\xE2\x80\x9CYou look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSomething very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: \xE2\x80\x98Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
this land.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CCan you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? \xE2\x80\x98This young
gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his
life! It is admirable!\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth tried to join in her father\xE2\x80\x99s pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you not diverted?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! yes. Pray read on.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\xE2\x80\x99 Mr.
Collins moreover adds, \xE2\x80\x98I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,
as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.\xE2\x80\x99 That is his notion of Christian
forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte\xE2\x80\x99s
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,
I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9CI am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\xE2\x80\x9D

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by
his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.



Chapter 58


Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time
to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat
in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others
to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty
was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.

They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said:

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must not blame my aunt. Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you _will_ thank me,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Clet it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
only of _you_.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, \xE2\x80\x9CYou are too generous to trifle with me. If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.

They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship\xE2\x80\x99s apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt taught me to hope,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cas I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \xE2\x80\x9CYes, you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth. \xE2\x80\x9CThe conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: \xE2\x80\x98had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.\xE2\x80\x99 Those were your words. You know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,
I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Darcy mentioned his letter. \xE2\x80\x9CDid it,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cdid it soon make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?\xE2\x80\x9D

She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI knew,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I wrote that letter,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9CI believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now
so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some
of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish
being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I
was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I
was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt
by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all
that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family
circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I
was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been
but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,
I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHad you then persuaded yourself that I should?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy object then,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Darcy, \xE2\x80\x9Cwas to show you, by every civility in
my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to
obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you.\xE2\x80\x9D

He then told her of Georgiana\xE2\x80\x99s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.

She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.

After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\xE2\x80\x9D was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI must ask whether you were surprised?\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\xE2\x80\x9D And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.

\xE2\x80\x9COn the evening before my going to London,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you speak from your own observation,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister\xE2\x80\x99s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
now.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,
and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.



Chapter 59


\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\xE2\x80\x9D was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,
and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to
say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no
one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
engaged.\xE2\x80\x9D

Jane looked at her doubtingly. \xE2\x80\x9COh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as
these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\xE2\x80\x9D cried
Jane. \xE2\x80\x9CMy dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let
me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley.\xE2\x80\x9D

Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances
of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow I am quite happy,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor you will be as happy as myself.
I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,
I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it to another, not to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling
to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.

                          * * * * *

\xE2\x80\x9CGood gracious!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, \xE2\x80\x9Cif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s
way.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.

As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, \xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Bennet, \xE2\x80\x9Cto walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt may do very well for the others,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Bingley; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won\xE2\x80\x99t it, Kitty?\xE2\x80\x9D Kitty owned that
she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went
up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:

\xE2\x80\x9CI am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane\xE2\x80\x99s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking
to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience.\xE2\x80\x9D

During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s consent should be
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother\xE2\x80\x99s. She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear
the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.

                          * * * * *

In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her father\xE2\x80\x99s opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, \xE2\x80\x9CGo to your father, he
wants you in the library.\xE2\x80\x9D She was gone directly.

Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\xE2\x80\x9D

How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.

\xE2\x80\x9COr, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you any other objection,\xE2\x80\x9D said Elizabeth, \xE2\x80\x9Cthan your belief of my
indifference?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNone at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do, I do like him,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, with tears in her eyes, \xE2\x80\x9CI love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLizzy,\xE2\x80\x9D said her father, \xE2\x80\x9CI have given him my consent. He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know
your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and
at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object
of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection
was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months\xE2\x80\x99
suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did
conquer her father\xE2\x80\x99s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, when she ceased speaking, \xE2\x80\x9CI have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.\xE2\x80\x9D

To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow\xE2\x80\x99s debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncle\xE2\x80\x99s doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\xE2\x80\x9D

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr. Collins\xE2\x80\x99s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, \xE2\x80\x9CIf any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\xE2\x80\x9D

Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour\xE2\x80\x99s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane\xE2\x80\x99s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dearest child,\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, \xE2\x80\x9CI can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! \xE2\x80\x98Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was a sad omen of what her mother\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations\xE2\x80\x99
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to
him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her
deference for his opinion.

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.

\xE2\x80\x9CI admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CWickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D



Chapter 60


Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. \xE2\x80\x9CHow could
you begin?\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CI can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor the liveliness of your mind, I did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWas there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was
ill at Netherfield?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I was embarrassed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd so was I.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA man who had felt less, might.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject. This will never do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine\xE2\x80\x99s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt\xE2\x80\x99s intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequence?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
befall her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be
done directly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.\xE2\x80\x9D

From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner\xE2\x80\x99s
long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

\xE2\x80\x9CI would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your
fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you
cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,
for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your
idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I
am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours, etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply
to his last.

\xE2\x80\x9CDEAR SIR,

\xE2\x80\x9CI must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon
be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.

\xE2\x80\x9CYours sincerely, etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.

The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,
was as sincere as her brother\xE2\x80\x99s in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.

Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew\xE2\x80\x99s letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. James\xE2\x80\x99s, with very decent composure. If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

Mrs. Phillips\xE2\x80\x99s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.



Chapter 61


Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride
she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may
be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.

Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s example,
she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia\xE2\x80\x99s
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet\xE2\x80\x99s being quite
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\xE2\x80\x99 beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.

As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
effect:

\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR LIZZY,

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so
rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,
do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.

\xE2\x80\x9CYours, etc.\xE2\x80\x9D

As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and
in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley\xE2\x80\x99s good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.

Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\xE2\x80\x99s marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.

Pemberley was now Georgiana\xE2\x80\x99s home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her way. By Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s instructions, she began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth\xE2\x80\x99s persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait
on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xE2\x80\x99s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
