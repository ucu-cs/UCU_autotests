Chapter I

My father\xE2\x80\x99s family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my
infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit
than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.

I give Pirrip as my father\xE2\x80\x99s family name, on the authority of his
tombstone and my sister,--Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.
As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness
of either of them (for their days were long before the days of
photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were
unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on
my father\xE2\x80\x99s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,
with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,
\xE2\x80\x9CAlso Georgiana Wife of the Above,\xE2\x80\x9D I drew a childish conclusion that
my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each
about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside
their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of
mine,--who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in
that universal struggle,--I am indebted for a belief I religiously
entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands
in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of
existence.

Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river
wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression
of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable
raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain
that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and
that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the
above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham,
Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead
and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard,
intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle
feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond
was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was
rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid
of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.

\xE2\x80\x9CHold your noise!\xE2\x80\x9D cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from
among the graves at the side of the church porch. \xE2\x80\x9CKeep still, you
little devil, or I\xE2\x80\x99ll cut your throat!\xE2\x80\x9D

A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man
with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his
head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and
lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by
briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose
teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Don\xE2\x80\x99t cut my throat, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D I pleaded in terror. \xE2\x80\x9CPray don\xE2\x80\x99t do it,
sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTell us your name!\xE2\x80\x9D said the man. \xE2\x80\x9CQuick!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPip, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnce more,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man, staring at me. \xE2\x80\x9CGive it mouth!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPip. Pip, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShow us where you live,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man. \xE2\x80\x9CPint out the place!\xE2\x80\x9D

I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the
alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.

The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and
emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When
the church came to itself,--for he was so sudden and strong that he
made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my
feet,--when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high
tombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou young dog,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man, licking his lips, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat fat cheeks you
ha\xE2\x80\x99 got.\xE2\x80\x9D

I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my
years, and not strong.

\xE2\x80\x9CDarn me if I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t eat em,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man, with a threatening shake
of his head, \xE2\x80\x9Cand if I han\xE2\x80\x99t half a mind to\xE2\x80\x99t!\xE2\x80\x9D

I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t, and held tighter to
the tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;
partly, to keep myself from crying.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow lookee here!\xE2\x80\x9D said the man. \xE2\x80\x9CWhere\xE2\x80\x99s your mother?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D I timidly explained. \xE2\x80\x9CAlso Georgiana. That\xE2\x80\x99s my mother.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, coming back. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd is that your father alonger your
mother?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said I; \xE2\x80\x9Chim too; late of this parish.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHa!\xE2\x80\x9D he muttered then, considering. \xE2\x80\x9CWho d\xE2\x80\x99ye live with,--supposin\xE2\x80\x99
you\xE2\x80\x99re kindly let to live, which I han\xE2\x80\x99t made up my mind about?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy sister, sir,--Mrs. Joe Gargery,--wife of Joe Gargery, the
blacksmith, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBlacksmith, eh?\xE2\x80\x9D said he. And looked down at his leg.

After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer
to my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he
could hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,
and mine looked most helplessly up into his.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow lookee here,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe question being whether you\xE2\x80\x99re to be let
to live. You know what a file is?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you know what wittles is?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

After each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a
greater sense of helplessness and danger.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou get me a file.\xE2\x80\x9D He tilted me again. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd you get me wittles.\xE2\x80\x9D He
tilted me again. \xE2\x80\x9CYou bring \xE2\x80\x98em both to me.\xE2\x80\x9D He tilted me again. \xE2\x80\x9COr
I\xE2\x80\x99ll have your heart and liver out.\xE2\x80\x9D He tilted me again.

I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both
hands, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CIf you would kindly please to let me keep upright,
sir, perhaps I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.\xE2\x80\x9D

He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped
over its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright
position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:--

\xE2\x80\x9CYou bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You
bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and you
never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having
seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to
live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no matter how
small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted,
and ate. Now, I ain\xE2\x80\x99t alone, as you may think I am. There\xE2\x80\x99s a young man
hid with me, in comparison with which young man I am a Angel. That young
man hears the words I speak. That young man has a secret way pecooliar
to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his liver. It
is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man. A
boy may lock his door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw
the clothes over his head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but
that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him
open. I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present
moment, with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young
man off of your inside. Now, what do you say?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken
bits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in
the morning.

\xE2\x80\x9CSay Lord strike you dead if you don\xE2\x80\x99t!\xE2\x80\x9D said the man.

I said so, and he took me down.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D he pursued, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou remember what you\xE2\x80\x99ve undertook, and you remember
that young man, and you get home!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGoo-good night, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D I faltered.

\xE2\x80\x9CMuch of that!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. \xE2\x80\x9CI
wish I was a frog. Or a eel!\xE2\x80\x9D

At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his
arms,--clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,--and limped
towards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the
nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked
in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,
stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his
ankle and pull him in.

When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose
legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When I
saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of
my legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on
again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking
his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the
marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or
the tide was in.

The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped
to look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not
nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long
angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the
river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the
prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon
by which the sailors steered,--like an unhooped cask upon a pole,--an
ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains
hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was limping on
towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life, and come
down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a terrible
turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to
gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I looked all
round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of him. But now
I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.




Chapter II

My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,
and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors
because she had brought me up \xE2\x80\x9Cby hand.\xE2\x80\x9D Having at that time to find out
for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and
heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as
well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up
by hand.

She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general
impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe
was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth
face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed
to have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,
good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,--a sort
of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.

My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing
redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible
she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall
and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her
figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in
front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful
merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this
apron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it
at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken it
off, every day of her life.

Joe\xE2\x80\x99s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the
dwellings in our country were,--most of them, at that time. When I ran
home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting
alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and having
confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I
raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,
sitting in the chimney corner.

\xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she\xE2\x80\x99s
out now, making it a baker\xE2\x80\x99s dozen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs she?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe; \xE2\x80\x9Cand what\xE2\x80\x99s worse, she\xE2\x80\x99s got Tickler with her.\xE2\x80\x9D

At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat
round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler
was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled
frame.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe sot down,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cand she got up, and she made a grab at
Tickler, and she Ram-paged out. That\xE2\x80\x99s what she did,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, slowly
clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at
it; \xE2\x80\x9Cshe Ram-paged out, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHas she been gone long, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D I always treated him as a larger species
of child, and as no more than my equal.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe\xE2\x80\x99s been on the
Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She\xE2\x80\x99s a coming! Get
behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.\xE2\x80\x9D

I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,
and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and
applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by throwing
me--I often served as a connubial missile--at Joe, who, glad to get hold
of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me
up there with his great leg.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere have you been, you young monkey?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Joe, stamping her
foot. \xE2\x80\x9CTell me directly what you\xE2\x80\x99ve been doing to wear me away with fret
and fright and worrit, or I\xE2\x80\x99d have you out of that corner if you was
fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have only been to the churchyard,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, from my stool, crying and
rubbing myself.

\xE2\x80\x9CChurchyard!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated my sister. \xE2\x80\x9CIf it warn\xE2\x80\x99t for me you\xE2\x80\x99d have been
to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by
hand?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou did,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd why did I do it, I should like to know?\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed my sister.

I whimpered, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t!\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99d never do it again! I know that. I may
truly say I\xE2\x80\x99ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.
It\xE2\x80\x99s bad enough to be a blacksmith\xE2\x80\x99s wife (and him a Gargery) without
being your mother.\xE2\x80\x9D

My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at
the fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the
mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was
under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me
in the avenging coals.

\xE2\x80\x9CHah!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. \xE2\x80\x9CChurchyard,
indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.\xE2\x80\x9D One of us, by the by, had
not said it at all. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99ll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one
of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you\xE2\x80\x99d be without me!\xE2\x80\x9D

As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me
over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and
calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the
grievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his
right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with
his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.

My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,
that never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard
and fast against her bib,--where it sometimes got a pin into it, and
sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she
took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in
an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,--using both
sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding
the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a final smart
wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off
the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into
two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.

On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my
slice. I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful
acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew
Mrs. Joe\xE2\x80\x99s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my
larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe. Therefore
I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my
trousers.

The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I
found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap
from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.
And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In
our already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his
good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare
the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each
other\xE2\x80\x99s admiration now and then,--which stimulated us to new exertions.
To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast
diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but
he found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and
my untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately
considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it
had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the
circumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at
me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.

Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss
of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he
didn\xE2\x80\x99t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than
usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like
a pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on
one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw
that my bread and butter was gone.

The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold
of his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister\xE2\x80\x99s
observation.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xE2\x80\x9D said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.

\xE2\x80\x9CI say, you know!\xE2\x80\x9D muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious
remonstrance. \xE2\x80\x9CPip, old chap! You\xE2\x80\x99ll do yourself a mischief. It\xE2\x80\x99ll stick
somewhere. You can\xE2\x80\x99t have chawed it, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated my sister, more sharply than before.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I\xE2\x80\x99d recommend you to do it,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Joe, all aghast. \xE2\x80\x9CManners is manners, but still your elth\xE2\x80\x99s your
elth.\xE2\x80\x9D

By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,
and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while
against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily
on.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, perhaps you\xE2\x80\x99ll mention what\xE2\x80\x99s the matter,\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister, out of
breath, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou staring great stuck pig.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and
looked at me again.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,
and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,
\xE2\x80\x9Cyou and me is always friends, and I\xE2\x80\x99d be the last to tell upon you,
any time. But such a--\xE2\x80\x9D he moved his chair and looked about the floor
between us, and then again at me--\xE2\x80\x9Csuch a most oncommon Bolt as that!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBeen bolting his food, has he?\xE2\x80\x9D cried my sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,
with his bite still in his cheek, \xE2\x80\x9CI Bolted, myself, when I was your
age--frequent--and as a boy I\xE2\x80\x99ve been among a many Bolters; but I never
see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it\xE2\x80\x99s a mercy you ain\xE2\x80\x99t Bolted
dead.\xE2\x80\x9D

My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying
nothing more than the awful words, \xE2\x80\x9CYou come along and be dosed.\xE2\x80\x9D

Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine
medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;
having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the
best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice
restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like a new
fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a
pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater
comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would
be held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to
swallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and
meditating before the fire), \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause he had had a turn.\xE2\x80\x9D Judging from
myself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had
none before.

Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in
the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret
burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great
punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe--I
never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the
housekeeping property as his--united to the necessity of always keeping
one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about
the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,
as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the
voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to
secrecy, declaring that he couldn\xE2\x80\x99t and wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t starve until to-morrow,
but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the young man
who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me
should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time,
and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to-night,
instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody\xE2\x80\x99s hair stood on end with terror,
mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody\xE2\x80\x99s ever did?

It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with
a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with
the load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the
load on HIS leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread
and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped away,
and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.

\xE2\x80\x9CHark!\xE2\x80\x9D said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm
in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; \xE2\x80\x9Cwas that great guns,
Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s another conwict off.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat does that mean, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,
\xE2\x80\x9CEscaped. Escaped.\xE2\x80\x9D Administering the definition like Tar-water.

While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my
mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s a convict?\xE2\x80\x9D Joe put his
mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I
could make out nothing of it but the single word \xE2\x80\x9CPip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere was a conwict off last night,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, aloud, \xE2\x80\x9Cafter
sunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they\xE2\x80\x99re
firing warning of another.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho\xE2\x80\x99s firing?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CDrat that boy,\xE2\x80\x9D interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,
\xE2\x80\x9Cwhat a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you\xE2\x80\x99ll be told no lies.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be
told lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite
unless there was company.

At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost
pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word
that looked to me like \xE2\x80\x9Csulks.\xE2\x80\x9D Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs.
Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, \xE2\x80\x9Cher?\xE2\x80\x9D But Joe wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide, and shook
the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make nothing of
the word.

\xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Joe,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, as a last resort, \xE2\x80\x9CI should like to know--if you
wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t much mind--where the firing comes from?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLord bless the boy!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed my sister, as if she didn\xE2\x80\x99t quite mean
that but rather the contrary. \xE2\x80\x9CFrom the Hulks!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh-h!\xE2\x80\x9D said I, looking at Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CHulks!\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, \xE2\x80\x9CWell, I told you so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd please, what\xE2\x80\x99s Hulks?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s the way with this boy!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed my sister, pointing me out
with her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. \xE2\x80\x9CAnswer him one
question, and he\xE2\x80\x99ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,
right \xE2\x80\x98cross th\xE2\x80\x99 meshes.\xE2\x80\x9D We always used that name for marshes, in our
country.

\xE2\x80\x9CI wonder who\xE2\x80\x99s put into prison-ships, and why they\xE2\x80\x99re put there?\xE2\x80\x9D said
I, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.

It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. \xE2\x80\x9CI tell you what,
young fellow,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9CI didn\xE2\x80\x99t bring you up by hand to badger
people\xE2\x80\x99s lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.
People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,
and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking
questions. Now, you get along to bed!\xE2\x80\x9D

I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs
in the dark, with my head tingling,--from Mrs. Joe\xE2\x80\x99s thimble
having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,--I
felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were
handy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking
questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.

Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought
that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.
No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in
mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was
in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal
terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had
no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed
me at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on
requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.

If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting
down the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly
pirate calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the
gibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at
once, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been
inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob
the pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no getting
a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have struck it out
of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate himself
rattling his chains.

As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot
with gray, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way, and
every crack in every board calling after me, \xE2\x80\x9CStop thief!\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CGet up,
Mrs. Joe!\xE2\x80\x9D In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than
usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging
up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back was half
turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for selection,
no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole some bread,
some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I tied up in
my pocket-handkerchief with my last night\xE2\x80\x99s slice), some brandy from a
stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used
for making that intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my
room: diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard),
a meat bone with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork
pie. I was nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount
upon a shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a
covered earthenware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and
I took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would
not be missed for some time.

There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I
unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe\xE2\x80\x99s tools.
Then I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which
I had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the misty
marshes.




Chapter III

It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the
outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all
night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the
damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of
spiders\xE2\x80\x99 webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On
every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick,
that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village--a
direction which they never accepted, for they never came there--was
invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up
at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a
phantom devoting me to the Hulks.

The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that
instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.
This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and
banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly
as could be, \xE2\x80\x9CA boy with somebody else\xE2\x80\x99s pork pie! Stop him!\xE2\x80\x9D The
cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,
and steaming out of their nostrils, \xE2\x80\x9CHalloa, young thief!\xE2\x80\x9D One black
ox, with a white cravat on,--who even had to my awakened conscience
something of a clerical air,--fixed me so obstinately with his eyes,
and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved
round, that I blubbered out to him, \xE2\x80\x9CI couldn\xE2\x80\x99t help it, sir! It wasn\xE2\x80\x99t
for myself I took it!\xE2\x80\x9D Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of
smoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and
a flourish of his tail.

All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I
went, I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as
the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I knew
my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a
Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when
I was \xE2\x80\x98prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks there!
However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to
the right, and consequently had to try back along the river-side, on the
bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide
out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just crossed a
ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled
up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me.
His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded, and was nodding
forward, heavy with sleep.

I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,
in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on
the shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but
another man!

And yet this man was dressed in coarse gray, too, and had a great iron
on his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that
the other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat
broad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for
I had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at
me,--it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself
down, for it made him stumble,--and then he ran into the mist, stumbling
twice as he went, and I lost him.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s the young man!\xE2\x80\x9D I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified
him. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had
known where it was.

I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right
man,--hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all
night left off hugging and limping,--waiting for me. He was awfully
cold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face
and die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that when
I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it occurred to
me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my bundle. He did
not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had, but left me
right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s in the bottle, boy?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

\xE2\x80\x9CBrandy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious
manner,--more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent
hurry, than a man who was eating it,--but he left off to take some of
the liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite
as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth,
without biting it off.

\xE2\x80\x9CI think you have got the ague,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m much of your opinion, boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s bad about here,\xE2\x80\x9D I told him. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99ve been lying out on the meshes,
and they\xE2\x80\x99re dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll eat my breakfast afore they\xE2\x80\x99re the death of me,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99d do
that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is
over there, directly afterwards. I\xE2\x80\x99ll beat the shivers so far, I\xE2\x80\x99ll bet
you.\xE2\x80\x9D

He was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all
at once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round
us, and often stopping--even stopping his jaws--to listen. Some real or
fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the
marsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,--

\xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, sir! No!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNor giv\xE2\x80\x99 no one the office to follow you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI believe you. You\xE2\x80\x99d be but a fierce young hound
indeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched
warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint
is!\xE2\x80\x9D

Something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,
and was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his
eyes.

Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down
upon the pie, I made bold to say, \xE2\x80\x9CI am glad you enjoy it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you speak?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI said I was glad you enjoyed it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThankee, my boy. I do.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now
noticed a decided similarity between the dog\xE2\x80\x99s way of eating, and the
man\xE2\x80\x99s. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He
swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;
and he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought
there was danger in every direction of somebody\xE2\x80\x99s coming to take the pie
away. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to appreciate
it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with him, without
making a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of which particulars
he was very like the dog.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid you won\xE2\x80\x99t leave any of it for him,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, timidly; after
a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making
the remark. \xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s no more to be got where that came from.\xE2\x80\x9D It was the
certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.

\xE2\x80\x9CLeave any for him? Who\xE2\x80\x99s him?\xE2\x80\x9D said my friend, stopping in his
crunching of pie-crust.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh ah!\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. \xE2\x80\x9CHim? Yes, yes!
He don\xE2\x80\x99t want no wittles.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought he looked as if he did,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and
the greatest surprise.

\xE2\x80\x9CLooked? When?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJust now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYonder,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, pointing; \xE2\x80\x9Cover there, where I found him nodding
asleep, and thought it was you.\xE2\x80\x9D

He held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his
first idea about cutting my throat had revived.

\xE2\x80\x9CDressed like you, you know, only with a hat,\xE2\x80\x9D I explained, trembling;
\xE2\x80\x9Cand--and\xE2\x80\x9D--I was very anxious to put this delicately--\xE2\x80\x9Cand with--the
same reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn\xE2\x80\x99t you hear the cannon
last night?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen there was firing!\xE2\x80\x9D he said to himself.

\xE2\x80\x9CI wonder you shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have been sure of that,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor
we heard it up at home, and that\xE2\x80\x99s farther away, and we were shut in
besides.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, see now!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CWhen a man\xE2\x80\x99s alone on these flats, with a
light head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears
nothin\xE2\x80\x99 all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees
the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried
afore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself
challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders \xE2\x80\x98Make
ready! Present! Cover him steady, men!\xE2\x80\x99 and is laid hands on--and
there\xE2\x80\x99s nothin\xE2\x80\x99! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night--coming up
in order, Damn \xE2\x80\x98em, with their tramp, tramp--I see a hundred. And as to
firing! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad
day,--But this man\xE2\x80\x9D; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my
being there; \xE2\x80\x9Cdid you notice anything in him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe had a badly bruised face,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, recalling what I hardly knew I
knew.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot here?\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly, with
the flat of his hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, there!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere is he?\xE2\x80\x9D He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of
his gray jacket. \xE2\x80\x9CShow me the way he went. I\xE2\x80\x99ll pull him down, like a
bloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,
boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man,
and he looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wet
grass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding
his own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which he
handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file. I
was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself into
this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away
from home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice, so
I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw
of him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his
fetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last
I heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still
going.




Chapter IV

I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me
up. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet
been made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the
house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon
the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,--an article into
which his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was
vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd where the deuce ha\xE2\x80\x99 you been?\xE2\x80\x9D was Mrs. Joe\xE2\x80\x99s Christmas salutation,
when I and my conscience showed ourselves.

I said I had been down to hear the Carols. \xE2\x80\x9CAh! well!\xE2\x80\x9D observed Mrs.
Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CYou might ha\xE2\x80\x99 done worse.\xE2\x80\x9D Not a doubt of that I thought.

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps if I warn\xE2\x80\x99t a blacksmith\xE2\x80\x99s wife, and (what\xE2\x80\x99s the same thing) a
slave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Mrs. Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m rather partial to Carols, myself, and that\xE2\x80\x99s the
best of reasons for my never hearing any.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had
retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a
conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes
were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them
to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper. This was so
much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together,
be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.

We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and
greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had
been made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not
being missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive
arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of
breakfast; \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I ain\xE2\x80\x99t,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Joe,--\xE2\x80\x9CI ain\xE2\x80\x99t a going to have
no formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I\xE2\x80\x99ve got
before me, I promise you!\xE2\x80\x9D

So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a
forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk
and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser. In
the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new
flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and
uncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never
uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool
haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white
crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a
basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of the other.
Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of
making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt
itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by
their religion.

My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that
is to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a
well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes,
he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.
Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and
everything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive occasion
he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture
of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me, I think my
sister must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom
an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and delivered over
to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law.
I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition
to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the
dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I was taken to have
a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of
Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.

Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle
for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to
what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever
Mrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be
equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had
done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the
Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the
terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived the
idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said,
\xE2\x80\x9CYe are now to declare it!\xE2\x80\x9D would be the time for me to rise and propose
a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure that I
might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this
extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.

Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble
the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe\xE2\x80\x99s uncle,
but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in
the nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was
half-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and
Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked
(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and
everything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.

The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and
the company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining
bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of; indeed
it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him
his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he himself confessed
that if the Church was \xE2\x80\x9Cthrown open,\xE2\x80\x9D meaning to competition, he would
not despair of making his mark in it. The Church not being \xE2\x80\x9Cthrown
open,\xE2\x80\x9D he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he punished the Amens
tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,--always giving the whole
verse,--he looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say,
\xE2\x80\x9CYou have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this
style!\xE2\x80\x9D

I opened the door to the company,--making believe that it was a habit
of ours to open that door,--and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next
to Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. I was
not allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.

\xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Joe,\xE2\x80\x9D said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged
slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair
standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been
all but choked, and had that moment come to, \xE2\x80\x9CI have brought you as the
compliments of the season--I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry
wine--and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.\xE2\x80\x9D

Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with
exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.
Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, \xE2\x80\x9CO, Un--cle
Pum-ble--chook! This is kind!\xE2\x80\x9D Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as
he now retorted, \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s no more than your merits. And now are you all
bobbish, and how\xE2\x80\x99s Sixpennorth of halfpence?\xE2\x80\x9D meaning me.

We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts
and oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like
Joe\xE2\x80\x99s change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister was
uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more
gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I remember
Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a
conventionally juvenile position, because she had married Mr. Hubble,--I
don\xE2\x80\x99t know at what remote period,--when she was much younger than he. I
remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered, stooping old man, of a
sawdusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in
my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when
I met him coming up the lane.

Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t
robbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in
at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the
Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak
(I didn\xE2\x80\x99t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips
of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork
of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain. No;
I should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone.
But they wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t leave me alone. They seemed to think the opportunity
lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and
then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an unfortunate
little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these
moral goads.

It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with
theatrical declamation,--as it now appears to me, something like a
religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,--and
ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.
Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low
reproachful voice, \xE2\x80\x9CDo you hear that? Be grateful.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEspecially,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, \xE2\x80\x9Cbe grateful, boy, to them which
brought you up by hand.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful
presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy is it that the
young are never grateful?\xE2\x80\x9D This moral mystery seemed too much for
the company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, \xE2\x80\x9CNaterally
wicious.\xE2\x80\x9D Everybody then murmured \xE2\x80\x9CTrue!\xE2\x80\x9D and looked at me in a
particularly unpleasant and personal manner.

Joe\xE2\x80\x99s station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when
there was company than when there was none. But he always aided and
comforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did so
at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being plenty
of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a
pint.

A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with
some severity, and intimated--in the usual hypothetical case of the
Church being \xE2\x80\x9Cthrown open\xE2\x80\x9D--what kind of sermon he would have given
them. After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, he remarked
that he considered the subject of the day\xE2\x80\x99s homily, ill chosen; which
was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many subjects
\xE2\x80\x9Cgoing about.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue again,\xE2\x80\x9D said Uncle Pumblechook. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99ve hit it, sir! Plenty of
subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their
tails. That\xE2\x80\x99s what\xE2\x80\x99s wanted. A man needn\xE2\x80\x99t go far to find a subject,
if he\xE2\x80\x99s ready with his salt-box.\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short
interval of reflection, \xE2\x80\x9CLook at Pork alone. There\xE2\x80\x99s a subject! If you
want a subject, look at Pork!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue, sir. Many a moral for the young,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Wopsle,--and I
knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; \xE2\x80\x9Cmight be deduced
from that text.\xE2\x80\x9D

(\xE2\x80\x9CYou listen to this,\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)

Joe gave me some more gravy.

\xE2\x80\x9CSwine,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork
at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,--\xE2\x80\x9Cswine were
the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put before us,
as an example to the young.\xE2\x80\x9D (I thought this pretty well in him who
had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.) \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is
detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COr girl,\xE2\x80\x9D suggested Mr. Hubble.

\xE2\x80\x9COf course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,\xE2\x80\x9D assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably,
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut there is no girl present.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBesides,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, \xE2\x80\x9Cthink what you\xE2\x80\x99ve
got to be grateful for. If you\xE2\x80\x99d been born a Squeaker--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe was, if ever a child was,\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister, most emphatically.

Joe gave me some more gravy.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook. \xE2\x80\x9CIf you
had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUnless in that form,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I don\xE2\x80\x99t mean in that form, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had
an objection to being interrupted; \xE2\x80\x9CI mean, enjoying himself with his
elders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and
rolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he
wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t. And what would have been your destination?\xE2\x80\x9D turning on me
again. \xE2\x80\x9CYou would have been disposed of for so many shillings according
to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have
come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped you
under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his frock
to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would have
shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then. Not a
bit of it!\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe was a world of trouble to you, ma\xE2\x80\x99am,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Hubble,
commiserating my sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CTrouble?\xE2\x80\x9D echoed my sister; \xE2\x80\x9Ctrouble?\xE2\x80\x9D and then entered on a fearful
catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts
of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled
from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I
had done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I
had contumaciously refused to go there.

I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with
their noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in
consequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s Roman nose so aggravated me, during
the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it
until he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in
comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the
pause was broken which ensued upon my sister\xE2\x80\x99s recital, and in which
pause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with
indignation and abhorrence.

\xE2\x80\x9CYet,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the
theme from which they had strayed, \xE2\x80\x9CPork--regarded as biled--is rich,
too; ain\xE2\x80\x99t it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHave a little brandy, uncle,\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister.

O Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say
it was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under
the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.

My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,
and poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man
trifled with his glass,--took it up, looked at it through the light,
put it down,--prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were
briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.

I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the
table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his
glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink
the brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with
unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning
round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance,
and rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,
violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and
apparently out of his mind.

I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn\xE2\x80\x99t know how
I had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my
dreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and
surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him, sank
down into his chair with the one significant gasp, \xE2\x80\x9CTar!\xE2\x80\x9D

I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be
worse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by
the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.

\xE2\x80\x9CTar!\xE2\x80\x9D cried my sister, in amazement. \xE2\x80\x9CWhy, how ever could Tar come
there?\xE2\x80\x9D

But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
hear the word, wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all
away with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had
begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in
getting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing
them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on to the
leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.

By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of
pudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.
The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the
genial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over
the day, when my sister said to Joe, \xE2\x80\x9CClean plates,--cold.\xE2\x80\x9D

I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my
bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul.
I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must taste,\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister, addressing the guests with her best
grace--\xE2\x80\x9Cyou must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious
present of Uncle Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s!\xE2\x80\x9D

Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must know,\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister, rising, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s a pie; a savory pork
pie.\xE2\x80\x9D

The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of
having deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,--quite vivaciously,
all things considered,--\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Mrs. Joe, we\xE2\x80\x99ll do our best endeavors;
let us have a cut at this same pie.\xE2\x80\x9D

My sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry. I
saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in the
Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that \xE2\x80\x9Ca bit of
savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do
no harm,\xE2\x80\x9D and I heard Joe say, \xE2\x80\x9CYou shall have some, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D I have never
been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,
merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that I
could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of the
table, and ran for my life.

But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost
into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair
of handcuffs to me, saying, \xE2\x80\x9CHere you are, look sharp, come on!\xE2\x80\x9D




Chapter V

The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their
loaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise
from table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen
empty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of
\xE2\x80\x9CGracious goodness gracious me, what\xE2\x80\x99s gone--with the--pie!\xE2\x80\x9D

The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring;
at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was
the sergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the
company, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his
right hand, and his left on my shoulder.

\xE2\x80\x9CExcuse me, ladies and gentleman,\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut as I have
mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver,\xE2\x80\x9D (which he hadn\xE2\x80\x99t), \xE2\x80\x9CI
am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd pray what might you want with him?\xE2\x80\x9D retorted my sister, quick to
resent his being wanted at all.

\xE2\x80\x9CMissis,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the gallant sergeant, \xE2\x80\x9Cspeaking for myself, I should
reply, the honor and pleasure of his fine wife\xE2\x80\x99s acquaintance; speaking
for the king, I answer, a little job done.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.
Pumblechook cried audibly, \xE2\x80\x9CGood again!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou see, blacksmith,\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant, who had by this time picked
out Joe with his eye, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe have had an accident with these, and I find
the lock of one of \xE2\x80\x98em goes wrong, and the coupling don\xE2\x80\x99t act pretty.
As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over
them?\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would
necessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer
two hours than one. \xE2\x80\x9CWill it? Then will you set about it at once,
blacksmith?\xE2\x80\x9D said the off-hand sergeant, \xE2\x80\x9Cas it\xE2\x80\x99s on his Majesty\xE2\x80\x99s
service. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they\xE2\x80\x99ll make themselves
useful.\xE2\x80\x9D With that, he called to his men, who came trooping into the
kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner. And then
they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands loosely clasped
before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now, easing a belt or a
pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks, out
into the yard.

All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I
was in an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the
handcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the
better of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little
more of my scattered wits.

\xE2\x80\x9CWould you give me the time?\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant, addressing himself to
Mr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the
inference that he was equal to the time.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s just gone half past two.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s not so bad,\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant, reflecting; \xE2\x80\x9Ceven if I was
forced to halt here nigh two hours, that\xE2\x80\x99ll do. How far might you call
yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJust a mile,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99ll do. We begin to close in upon \xE2\x80\x98em about dusk. A little before
dusk, my orders are. That\xE2\x80\x99ll do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CConvicts, sergeant?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.

\xE2\x80\x9CAy!\xE2\x80\x9D returned the sergeant, \xE2\x80\x9Ctwo. They\xE2\x80\x99re pretty well known to be out
on the marshes still, and they won\xE2\x80\x99t try to get clear of \xE2\x80\x98em before
dusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?\xE2\x80\x9D

Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of
me.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant, \xE2\x80\x9Cthey\xE2\x80\x99ll find themselves trapped in a circle,
I expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you\xE2\x80\x99re ready,
his Majesty the King is.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather apron
on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its wooden
windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the bellows, the
rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then Joe began to
hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.

The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general
attention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beer
from the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a glass
of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, \xE2\x80\x9CGive him wine, Mum. I\xE2\x80\x99ll
engage there\xE2\x80\x99s no tar in that:\xE2\x80\x9D so, the sergeant thanked him and said
that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take wine, if it
was equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his Majesty\xE2\x80\x99s
health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a mouthful and
smacked his lips.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood stuff, eh, sergeant?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you something,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the sergeant; \xE2\x80\x9CI suspect that
stuff\xE2\x80\x99s of your providing.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, \xE2\x80\x9CAy, ay? Why?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou\xE2\x80\x99re
a man that knows what\xE2\x80\x99s what.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CD\xE2\x80\x99ye think so?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. \xE2\x80\x9CHave
another glass!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith you. Hob and nob,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the sergeant. \xE2\x80\x9CThe top of mine to the
foot of yours,--the foot of yours to the top of mine,--Ring once, ring
twice,--the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live
a thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you
are at the present moment of your life!\xE2\x80\x9D

The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for
another glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality
appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the
bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a
gush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine
that he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the
same liberality, when the first was gone.

As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,
enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for
a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed
themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened
with the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively
anticipation of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe two villains\xE2\x80\x9D being taken, and when the bellows
seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke
to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them,
and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the
blaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale
afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned
pale on their account, poor wretches.

At last, Joe\xE2\x80\x99s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As Joe
got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us should
go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr. Pumblechook
and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies\xE2\x80\x99 society; but
Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was agreeable,
and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should have got leave
to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe\xE2\x80\x99s curiosity to know all about it and
how it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, \xE2\x80\x9CIf you bring the boy
back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don\xE2\x80\x99t look to me to put it
together again.\xE2\x80\x9D

The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.
Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully
sensible of that gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s merits under arid conditions, as when
something moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.
Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and
to speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in
the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably
whispered to Joe, \xE2\x80\x9CI hope, Joe, we shan\xE2\x80\x99t find them.\xE2\x80\x9D and Joe whispered
to me, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99d give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was
cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming
on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A
few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came
out. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.
There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant\xE2\x80\x99s
hand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the
graves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding
anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate
at the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us
here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.

Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little
thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men
hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should
come upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who
had brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving
imp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the
hunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in
treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?

It was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe\xE2\x80\x99s
back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a
hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and
to keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a
pretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking
the course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.
Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.
Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the
mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,
though all of a watery lead color.

With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe\xE2\x80\x99s broad shoulder, I
looked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I could
hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by his
blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and
could dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful
start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a
sheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at
us; and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared
angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except
these things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,
there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.

The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we
were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all
stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a
long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but
it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised
together,--if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.

To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under
their breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment\xE2\x80\x99s listening,
Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)
agreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not
be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men
should make towards it \xE2\x80\x9Cat the double.\xE2\x80\x9D So we slanted to the right
(where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to
hold on tight to keep my seat.

It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he
spoke all the time, \xE2\x80\x9Ca Winder.\xE2\x80\x9D Down banks and up banks, and over gates,
and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no man cared
where he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and
more apparent that it was made by more than one voice. Sometimes, it
seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped. When it broke
out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we
after them. After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one
voice calling \xE2\x80\x9CMurder!\xE2\x80\x9D and another voice, \xE2\x80\x9CConvicts! Runaways! Guard!
This way for the runaway convicts!\xE2\x80\x9D Then both voices would seem to be
stifled in a struggle, and then would break out again. And when it had
come to this, the soldiers ran like deer, and Joe too.

The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two
of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and levelled
when we all ran in.

\xE2\x80\x9CHere are both men!\xE2\x80\x9D panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a
ditch. \xE2\x80\x9CSurrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come
asunder!\xE2\x80\x9D

Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn, and
blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the ditch to
help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and the other
one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling; but
of course I knew them both directly.

\xE2\x80\x9CMind!\xE2\x80\x9D said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged
sleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: \xE2\x80\x9CI took him! I give him
up to you! Mind that!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s not much to be particular about,\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant; \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99ll do you
small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs there!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t expect it to do me any good. I don\xE2\x80\x99t want it to do me more good
than it does now,\xE2\x80\x9D said my convict, with a greedy laugh. \xE2\x80\x9CI took him. He
knows it. That\xE2\x80\x99s enough for me.\xE2\x80\x9D

The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old
bruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.
He could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both
separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from
falling.

\xE2\x80\x9CTake notice, guard,--he tried to murder me,\xE2\x80\x9D were his first words.

\xE2\x80\x9CTried to murder him?\xE2\x80\x9D said my convict, disdainfully. \xE2\x80\x9CTry, and not
do it? I took him, and giv\xE2\x80\x99 him up; that\xE2\x80\x99s what I done. I not only
prevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,--dragged
him this far on his way back. He\xE2\x80\x99s a gentleman, if you please, this
villain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder
him? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag
him back!\xE2\x80\x9D

The other one still gasped, \xE2\x80\x9CHe tried--he tried-to--murder me.
Bear--bear witness.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLookee here!\xE2\x80\x9D said my convict to the sergeant. \xE2\x80\x9CSingle-handed I got
clear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha\xE2\x80\x99 got
clear of these death-cold flats likewise--look at my leg: you won\xE2\x80\x99t find
much iron on it--if I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t made the discovery that he was here. Let
him go free? Let him profit by the means as I found out? Let him make a
tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had died at
the bottom there,\xE2\x80\x9D and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his
manacled hands, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99d have held to him with that grip, that you should
have been safe to find him in my hold.\xE2\x80\x9D

The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his
companion, repeated, \xE2\x80\x9CHe tried to murder me. I should have been a dead
man if you had not come up.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe lies!\xE2\x80\x9D said my convict, with fierce energy. \xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s a liar born, and
he\xE2\x80\x99ll die a liar. Look at his face; ain\xE2\x80\x99t it written there? Let him turn
those eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it.\xE2\x80\x9D

The other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not, however,
collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression, looked
at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and at the sky, but
certainly did not look at the speaker.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you see him?\xE2\x80\x9D pursued my convict. \xE2\x80\x9CDo you see what a villain he is?
Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That\xE2\x80\x99s how he looked
when we were tried together. He never looked at me.\xE2\x80\x9D

The other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes
restlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment on
the speaker, with the words, \xE2\x80\x9CYou are not much to look at,\xE2\x80\x9D and with
a half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict
became so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him
but for the interposition of the soldiers. \xE2\x80\x9CDidn\xE2\x80\x99t I tell you,\xE2\x80\x9D said the
other convict then, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he would murder me, if he could?\xE2\x80\x9D And any one
could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon his
lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.

\xE2\x80\x9CEnough of this parley,\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant. \xE2\x80\x9CLight those torches.\xE2\x80\x9D

As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down
on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first time,
and saw me. I had alighted from Joe\xE2\x80\x99s back on the brink of the ditch
when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly when
he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I had
been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my
innocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended
my intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it
all passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for
a day, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having
been more attentive.

The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four
torches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been
almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards
very dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in
a ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches kindled
at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite
bank of the river. \xE2\x80\x9CAll right,\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant. \xE2\x80\x9CMarch.\xE2\x80\x9D

We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a
sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. \xE2\x80\x9CYou are expected
on board,\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant to my convict; \xE2\x80\x9Cthey know you are coming.
Don\xE2\x80\x99t straggle, my man. Close up here.\xE2\x80\x9D

The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard.
I had hold of Joe\xE2\x80\x99s hand now, and Joe carried one of the torches. Mr.
Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to see it out, so
we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good path now, mostly
on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and there where a dike
came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice-gate. When
I looked round, I could see the other lights coming in after us. The
torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track, and
I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I could see nothing
else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air about us with their
pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they
limped along in the midst of the muskets. We could not go fast, because
of their lameness; and they were so spent, that two or three times we
had to halt while they rested.

After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut
and a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,
and the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was
a smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and
a stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an
overgrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a dozen
soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their
great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their heads
and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant made some
kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I
call the other convict was drafted off with his guard, to go on board
first.

My convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the
hut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up
his feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if
he pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the
sergeant, and remarked,--

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some
persons laying under suspicion alonger me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou can say what you like,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the sergeant, standing coolly
looking at him with his arms folded, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut you have no call to say it
here. You\xE2\x80\x99ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it,
before it\xE2\x80\x99s done with, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can\xE2\x80\x99t
starve; at least I can\xE2\x80\x99t. I took some wittles, up at the willage over
yonder,--where the church stands a\xE2\x80\x99most out on the marshes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou mean stole,\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you where from. From the blacksmith\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa!\xE2\x80\x9D said the sergeant, staring at Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, staring at me.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was some broken wittles--that\xE2\x80\x99s what it was--and a dram of liquor,
and a pie.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?\xE2\x80\x9D asked
the sergeant, confidentially.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don\xE2\x80\x99t you know, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo,\xE2\x80\x9D said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and
without the least glance at me,--\xE2\x80\x9Cso you\xE2\x80\x99re the blacksmith, are you?
Than I\xE2\x80\x99m sorry to say, I\xE2\x80\x99ve eat your pie.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGod knows you\xE2\x80\x99re welcome to it,--so far as it was ever mine,\xE2\x80\x9D returned
Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CWe don\xE2\x80\x99t know what you have
done, but we wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have you starved to death for it, poor miserable
fellow-creatur.--Would us, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man\xE2\x80\x99s throat
again, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard were
ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough stakes
and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a crew of
convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or interested
in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or spoke a word,
except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, \xE2\x80\x9CGive way,
you!\xE2\x80\x9D which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the light of the
torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of
the shore, like a wicked Noah\xE2\x80\x99s ark. Cribbed and barred and moored by
massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be
ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we saw
him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches were
flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over with
him.




Chapter VI

My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so
unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I hope
it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.

I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference
to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But
I loved Joe,--perhaps for no better reason in those early days than
because the dear fellow let me love him,--and, as to him, my inner self
was not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when
I first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe the
whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted that
if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing Joe\xE2\x80\x99s
confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night
staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up my
tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I never
afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker,
without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe knew it, I
never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at yesterday\xE2\x80\x99s
meat or pudding when it came on to-day\xE2\x80\x99s table, without thinking that he
was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That, if Joe knew it, and
at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his
beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he suspected tar in it,
would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word, I was too cowardly
to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing
what I knew to be wrong. I had had no intercourse with the world at
that time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this
manner. Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of
action for myself.

As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took
me on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresome
journey of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad
temper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have
excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In
his lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such
an insane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the
kitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have
hanged him, if it had been a capital offence.

By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little
drunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having
been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of
tongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump between the
shoulders, and the restorative exclamation \xE2\x80\x9CYah! Was there ever such
a boy as this!\xE2\x80\x9D from my sister,) I found Joe telling them about the
convict\xE2\x80\x99s confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways
by which he had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook made out, after
carefully surveying the premises, that he had first got upon the roof of
the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the house, and had then let
himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut
into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very positive and drove his
own chaise-cart--over everybody--it was agreed that it must be so. Mr.
Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, \xE2\x80\x9CNo!\xE2\x80\x9D with the feeble malice of a
tired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat on, he was unanimously
set at naught,--not to mention his smoking hard behind, as he stood
with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not
calculated to inspire confidence.

This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a
slumberous offence to the company\xE2\x80\x99s eyesight, and assisted me up to bed
with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be
dangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as
I have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted
long after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned
saving on exceptional occasions.




Chapter VII

At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family
tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My
construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I
read \xE2\x80\x9Cwife of the Above\xE2\x80\x9D as a complimentary reference to my father\xE2\x80\x99s
exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations
had been referred to as \xE2\x80\x9CBelow,\xE2\x80\x9D I have no doubt I should have formed
the worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my notions
of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at
all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my
declaration that I was to \xE2\x80\x9Cwalk in the same all the days of my life,\xE2\x80\x9D
 laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our
house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down
by the wheelwright\xE2\x80\x99s or up by the mill.

When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could
assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called \xE2\x80\x9CPompeyed,\xE2\x80\x9D or
(as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only odd-boy about the
forge, but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten
birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favored with the
employment. In order, however, that our superior position might not be
compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf,
into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were
dropped. I have an impression that they were to be contributed
eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I
had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.

Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is
to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited
infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in
the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving
opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage, and Mr.
Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to overhear him
reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally
bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle \xE2\x80\x9Cexamined\xE2\x80\x9D
 the scholars once a quarter. What he did on those occasions was to turn
up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark Antony\xE2\x80\x99s oration over
the body of Caesar. This was always followed by Collins\xE2\x80\x99s Ode on
the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge
throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the
War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not with me then,
as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions,
and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of
both gentlemen.

Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,
kept in the same room--a little general shop. She had no idea what stock
she had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a little
greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue
of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transactions.
Biddy was Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt\xE2\x80\x99s granddaughter; I confess myself
quite unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she was
to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been
brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of
her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always
wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at
heel. This description must be received with a week-day limitation. On
Sundays, she went to church elaborated.

Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.
Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been
a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every
letter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who
seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and
baffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to
read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.

One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending
great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must have
been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long
time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet on the
hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print
and smear this epistle:--

\xE2\x80\x9CMI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE
U JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN
BLEVE ME INF XN PIP.\xE2\x80\x9D

There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by
letter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered
this written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe
received it as a miracle of erudition.

\xE2\x80\x9CI say, Pip, old chap!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat a
scholar you are! An\xE2\x80\x99t you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should like to be,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, glancing at the slate as he held it; with
a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, here\xE2\x80\x99s a J,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cand a O equal to anythink! Here\xE2\x80\x99s a J and
a O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this
monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I
accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit
his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to
embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I
should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, \xE2\x80\x9CAh! But read the
rest, Jo.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe rest, eh, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching eye,
\xE2\x80\x9COne, two, three. Why, here\xE2\x80\x99s three Js, and three Os, and three J-O,
Joes in it, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D

I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole
letter.

\xE2\x80\x9CAstonishing!\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, when I had finished. \xE2\x80\x9CYou ARE a scholar.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow do you spell Gargery, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked him, with a modest patronage.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t spell it at all,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut supposing you did?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt can\xE2\x80\x99t be supposed,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CTho\xE2\x80\x99 I\xE2\x80\x99m uncommon fond of reading,
too.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COn-common. Give me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Ca good book, or a good newspaper, and
sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!\xE2\x80\x9D he continued,
after rubbing his knees a little, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen you do come to a J and a O, and
says you, \xE2\x80\x98Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,\xE2\x80\x99 how interesting reading is!\xE2\x80\x9D

I derived from this, that Joe\xE2\x80\x99s education, like Steam, was yet in its
infancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,--

\xE2\x80\x9CDidn\xE2\x80\x99t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy didn\xE2\x80\x99t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to
his usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire
between the lower bars; \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given
to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at
my mother, most onmerciful. It were a\xE2\x80\x99most the only hammering he did,
indeed, \xE2\x80\x98xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only
to be equalled by the wigor with which he didn\xE2\x80\x99t hammer at his
anwil.--You\xE2\x80\x99re a listening and understanding, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several
times; and then my mother she\xE2\x80\x99d go out to work, and she\xE2\x80\x99d say, \xE2\x80\x9CJoe,\xE2\x80\x9D
 she\xE2\x80\x99d say, \xE2\x80\x9Cnow, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,\xE2\x80\x9D and
she\xE2\x80\x99d put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that
he couldn\xE2\x80\x99t abear to be without us. So, he\xE2\x80\x99d come with a most tremenjous
crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was, that
they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us
up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us. Which, you see,
Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the fire, and
looking at me, \xE2\x80\x9Cwere a drawback on my learning.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly, poor Joe!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThough mind you, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the
poker on the top bar, \xE2\x80\x9Crendering unto all their doo, and maintaining
equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his hart,
don\xE2\x80\x99t you see?\xE2\x80\x9D

I didn\xE2\x80\x99t see; but I didn\xE2\x80\x99t say so.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D Joe pursued, \xE2\x80\x9Csomebody must keep the pot a biling, Pip, or the
pot won\xE2\x80\x99t bile, don\xE2\x80\x99t you know?\xE2\x80\x9D

I saw that, and said so.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Consequence, my father didn\xE2\x80\x99t make objections to my going to work; so
I went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he
would have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you, Pip.
In time I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a
purple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his
tombstone that, Whatsume\xE2\x80\x99er the failings on his part, Remember reader he
were that good in his heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful
perspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.

\xE2\x80\x9CI made it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cmy own self. I made it in a moment. It was like
striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so much
surprised in all my life,--couldn\xE2\x80\x99t credit my own ed,--to tell you the
truth, hardly believed it were my own ed. As I was saying, Pip, it were
my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs money, cut
it how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not to mention
bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother.
She were in poor elth, and quite broke. She weren\xE2\x80\x99t long of following,
poor soul, and her share of peace come round at last.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe\xE2\x80\x99s blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them, and
then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the
round knob on the top of the poker.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt were but lonesome then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cliving here alone, and I got
acquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D--Joe looked firmly at me as
if he knew I was not going to agree with him;--\xE2\x80\x9Cyour sister is a fine
figure of a woman.\xE2\x80\x9D

I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhatever family opinions, or whatever the world\xE2\x80\x99s opinions, on that
subject may be, Pip, your sister is,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe tapped the top bar with the
poker after every word following, \xE2\x80\x9Ca-fine-figure--of--a--woman!\xE2\x80\x9D

I could think of nothing better to say than \xE2\x80\x9CI am glad you think so,
Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo am I,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Joe, catching me up. \xE2\x80\x9CI am glad I think so, Pip. A
little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does it
signify to Me?\xE2\x80\x9D

I sagaciously observed, if it didn\xE2\x80\x99t signify to him, to whom did it
signify?

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly!\xE2\x80\x9D assented Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s it. You\xE2\x80\x99re right, old chap! When I
got acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing
you up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,
along with all the folks. As to you,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe pursued with a countenance
expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you could have
been aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you\xE2\x80\x99d have
formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!\xE2\x80\x9D

Not exactly relishing this, I said, \xE2\x80\x9CNever mind me, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I did mind you, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned with tender simplicity. \xE2\x80\x9CWhen
I offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at
such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to
her, \xE2\x80\x98And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little child,\xE2\x80\x99
I said to your sister, \xE2\x80\x98there\xE2\x80\x99s room for him at the forge!\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:
who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, \xE2\x80\x9CEver the best of friends;
an\xE2\x80\x99t us, Pip? Don\xE2\x80\x99t cry, old chap!\xE2\x80\x9D

When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:--

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, you see, Pip, and here we are! That\xE2\x80\x99s about where it lights; here
we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I tell
you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn\xE2\x80\x99t see
too much of what we\xE2\x80\x99re up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the sly.
And why on the sly? I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you why, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could have
proceeded in his demonstration.

\xE2\x80\x9CYour sister is given to government.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGiven to government, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea
(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a favor
of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.

\xE2\x80\x9CGiven to government,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CWhich I meantersay the government of
you and myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd she an\xE2\x80\x99t over partial to having scholars on the premises,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe
continued, \xE2\x80\x9Cand in partickler would not be over partial to my being a
scholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don\xE2\x80\x99t you see?\xE2\x80\x9D

I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as \xE2\x80\x9CWhy--\xE2\x80\x9D
 when Joe stopped me.

\xE2\x80\x9CStay a bit. I know what you\xE2\x80\x99re a going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I don\xE2\x80\x99t
deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I don\xE2\x80\x99t
deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down upon us
heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe
sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, \xE2\x80\x9Ccandor compels fur
to admit that she is a Buster.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital
Bs.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy don\xE2\x80\x99t I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, passing the poker in to his left hand, that he might
feel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that
placid occupation; \xE2\x80\x9Cyour sister\xE2\x80\x99s a master-mind. A master-mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s that?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But
Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely
stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,
\xE2\x80\x9CHer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I ain\xE2\x80\x99t a master-mind,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,
and got back to his whisker. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd last of all, Pip,--and this I want to
say very serious to you, old chap,--I see so much in my poor mother,
of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never
getting no peace in her mortal days, that I\xE2\x80\x99m dead afeerd of going wrong
in the way of not doing what\xE2\x80\x99s right by a woman, and I\xE2\x80\x99d fur rather
of the two go wrong the t\xE2\x80\x99other way, and be a little ill-conwenienced
myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn\xE2\x80\x99t
no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself;
but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you\xE2\x80\x99ll
overlook shortcomings.\xE2\x80\x9D

Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that
night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but, afterwards
at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him, I had
a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my
heart.

\xE2\x80\x9CHowever,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; \xE2\x80\x9Chere\xE2\x80\x99s the
Dutch-clock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of \xE2\x80\x98em,
and she\xE2\x80\x99s not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s mare mayn\xE2\x80\x99t have
set a forefoot on a piece o\xE2\x80\x99 ice, and gone down.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,
to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a
woman\xE2\x80\x99s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no
confidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe
was out on one of these expeditions.

Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to
listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew
keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of
lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars, and
considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them
as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering
multitude.

\xE2\x80\x9CHere comes the mare,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cringing like a peal of bells!\xE2\x80\x9D

The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she
came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out, ready
for Mrs. Joe\xE2\x80\x99s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a
bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might
be out of its place. When we had completed these preparations, they
drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon landed, and Uncle
Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we
were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that
it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and
throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,
\xE2\x80\x9Cif this boy ain\xE2\x80\x99t grateful this night, he never will be!\xE2\x80\x9D

I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly
uninformed why he ought to assume that expression.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s only to be hoped,\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he won\xE2\x80\x99t be Pompeyed. But
I have my fears.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe ain\xE2\x80\x99t in that line, Mum,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook. \xE2\x80\x9CShe knows better.\xE2\x80\x9D

She? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,
\xE2\x80\x9CShe?\xE2\x80\x9D Joe looked at me, making the motion with his lips and eyebrows,
\xE2\x80\x9CShe?\xE2\x80\x9D My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of his hand
across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and
looked at her.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister, in her snappish way. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat are you staring at?
Is the house afire?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C--Which some individual,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe politely hinted, \xE2\x80\x9Cmentioned--she.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd she is a she, I suppose?\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister. \xE2\x80\x9CUnless you call Miss
Havisham a he. And I doubt if even you\xE2\x80\x99ll go so far as that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham, up town?\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs there any Miss Havisham down town?\xE2\x80\x9D returned my sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he\xE2\x80\x99s going. And
he had better play there,\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister, shaking her head at me as an
encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, \xE2\x80\x9Cor I\xE2\x80\x99ll work him.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had heard of Miss Havisham up town,--everybody for miles round had
heard of Miss Havisham up town,--as an immensely rich and grim lady who
lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who
led a life of seclusion.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell to be sure!\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, astounded. \xE2\x80\x9CI wonder how she come to know
Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNoodle!\xE2\x80\x9D cried my sister. \xE2\x80\x9CWho said she knew him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C--Which some individual,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe again politely hinted, \xE2\x80\x9Cmentioned that
she wanted him to go and play there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd couldn\xE2\x80\x99t she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and
play there? Isn\xE2\x80\x99t it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be
a tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes--we won\xE2\x80\x99t say quarterly
or half-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you--but
sometimes--go there to pay his rent? And couldn\xE2\x80\x99t she then ask Uncle
Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn\xE2\x80\x99t Uncle
Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for us--though you
may not think it, Joseph,\xE2\x80\x9D in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if
he were the most callous of nephews, \xE2\x80\x9Cthen mention this boy, standing
Prancing here\xE2\x80\x9D--which I solemnly declare I was not doing--\xE2\x80\x9Cthat I have
for ever been a willing slave to?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood again!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Uncle Pumblechook. \xE2\x80\x9CWell put! Prettily pointed! Good
indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Joseph,\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe
apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,
\xE2\x80\x9Cyou do not yet--though you may not think it--know the case. You may
consider that you do, but you do not, Joseph. For you do not know that
Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell, this
boy\xE2\x80\x99s fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, has offered
to take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to keep
him to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s
to-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!\xE2\x80\x9D cried my sister, casting off her
bonnet in sudden desperation, \xE2\x80\x9Chere I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs,
with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door,
and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the
sole of his foot!\xE2\x80\x9D

With that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face was
squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps of
water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and thumped,
and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside myself. (I
may here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than
any living authority, with the ridgy effect of a wedding-ring, passing
unsympathetically over the human countenance.)

When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the
stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was
trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered
over to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the
Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been
dying to make all along: \xE2\x80\x9CBoy, be forever grateful to all friends, but
especially unto them which brought you up by hand!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood-bye, Joe!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGod bless you, Pip, old chap!\xE2\x80\x9D

I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what
with soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart.
But they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the
questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, and what
on earth I was expected to play at.




Chapter VIII

Mr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s premises in the High Street of the market town,
were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a
cornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must be a
very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop; and
I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the
tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs
ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom.

It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this
speculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in
an attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the
bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my
eyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity
between seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did
his shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the
corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor
about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew
which was which. The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr.
Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the
street at the saddler, who appeared to transact his business by keeping
his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his
hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his turn folded
his arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his door and yawned at
the chemist. The watchmaker, always poring over a little desk with
a magnifying-glass at his eye, and always inspected by a group of
smock-frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop-window,
seemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade
engaged his attention.

Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the parlor behind
the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread
and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered Mr.
Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my sister\xE2\x80\x99s
idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted
to my diet,--besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination
with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into
my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out
altogether,--his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic. On
my politely bidding him Good morning, he said, pompously, \xE2\x80\x9CSeven times
nine, boy?\xE2\x80\x9D And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in
a strange place, on an empty stomach! I was hungry, but before I had
swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum that lasted all through the
breakfast. \xE2\x80\x9CSeven?\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CAnd four?\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CAnd eight?\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CAnd six?\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CAnd two?\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CAnd
ten?\xE2\x80\x9D And so on. And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much
as I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came; while he sat
at his ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I
may be allowed the expression) a gorging and gormandizing manner.

For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o\xE2\x80\x99clock came and we started
for Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the
manner in which I should acquit myself under that lady\xE2\x80\x99s roof. Within
a quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s house, which was of old
brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the
windows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were
rustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so
we had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come
to open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.
Pumblechook said, \xE2\x80\x9CAnd fourteen?\xE2\x80\x9D but I pretended not to hear him), and
saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing
was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long
time.

A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded \xE2\x80\x9CWhat name?\xE2\x80\x9D To which my
conductor replied, \xE2\x80\x9CPumblechook.\xE2\x80\x9D The voice returned, \xE2\x80\x9CQuite right,\xE2\x80\x9D and
the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the court-yard,
with keys in her hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, \xE2\x80\x9Cis Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is Pip, is it?\xE2\x80\x9D returned the young lady, who was very pretty and
seemed very proud; \xE2\x80\x9Ccome in, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D she said. \xE2\x80\x9CDid you wish to see Miss Havisham?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf Miss Havisham wished to see me,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Pumblechook,
discomfited.

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D said the girl; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut you see she don\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x9D

She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.
Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not
protest. But he eyed me severely,--as if I had done anything to
him!--and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: \xE2\x80\x9CBoy! Let
your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand!\xE2\x80\x9D
 I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound
through the gate, \xE2\x80\x9CAnd sixteen?\xE2\x80\x9D But he didn\xE2\x80\x99t.

My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.
It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The
brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the
wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood
open, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.
The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and
it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the
brewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.

She saw me looking at it, and she said, \xE2\x80\x9CYou could drink without hurt
all the strong beer that\xE2\x80\x99s brewed there now, boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should think I could, miss,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, in a shy way.

\xE2\x80\x9CBetter not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;
don\xE2\x80\x99t you think so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt looks like it, miss.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot that anybody means to try,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor that\xE2\x80\x99s all done with,
and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong
beer, there\xE2\x80\x99s enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor
House.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that the name of this house, miss?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COne of its names, boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt has more than one, then, miss?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COne more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or
Hebrew, or all three--or all one to me--for enough.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEnough House,\xE2\x80\x9D said I; \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s a curious name, miss.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it meant more than it said. It meant, when it
was given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They
must have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But don\xE2\x80\x99t
loiter, boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

Though she called me \xE2\x80\x9Cboy\xE2\x80\x9D so often, and with a carelessness that was
far from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much
older than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and self-possessed;
and she was as scornful of me as if she had been one-and-twenty, and a
queen.

We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two
chains across it outside,--and the first thing I noticed was, that the
passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.
She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,
and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.

At last we came to the door of a room, and she said, \xE2\x80\x9CGo in.\xE2\x80\x9D

I answered, more in shyness than politeness, \xE2\x80\x9CAfter you, miss.\xE2\x80\x9D

To this she returned: \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.\xE2\x80\x9D And
scornfully walked away, and--what was worse--took the candle with her.

This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only
thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told
from within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty
large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of daylight was to
be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture,
though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me. But
prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that
I made out at first sight to be a fine lady\xE2\x80\x99s dressing-table.

Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no
fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an
elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the
strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.

She was dressed in rich materials,--satins, and lace, and silks,--all
of white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent
from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was
white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and
some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid
than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.
She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,--the
other was on the table near her hand,--her veil was but half arranged,
her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay
with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and
some flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the
looking-glass.

It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though
I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I
saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been
white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw
that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and
like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her
sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure
of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had
shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly
waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage
lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches
to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of
a vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to
have dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if
I could.

\xE2\x80\x9CWho is it?\xE2\x80\x9D said the lady at the table.

\xE2\x80\x9CPip, ma\xE2\x80\x99am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s boy, ma\xE2\x80\x99am. Come--to play.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCome nearer; let me look at you. Come close.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of
the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped
at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at
twenty minutes to nine.

\xE2\x80\x9CLook at me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham. \xE2\x80\x9CYou are not afraid of a woman who has
never seen the sun since you were born?\xE2\x80\x9D

I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie
comprehended in the answer \xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know what I touch here?\xE2\x80\x9D she said, laying her hands, one upon
the other, on her left side.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, ma\xE2\x80\x99am.\xE2\x80\x9D (It made me think of the young man.)

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do I touch?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBroken!\xE2\x80\x9D

She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and
with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept
her hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they
were heavy.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am tired,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham. \xE2\x80\x9CI want diversion, and I have done
with men and women. Play.\xE2\x80\x9D

I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she
could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide
world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.

\xE2\x80\x9CI sometimes have sick fancies,\xE2\x80\x9D she went on, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I have a sick fancy
that I want to see some play. There, there!\xE2\x80\x9D with an impatient movement
of the fingers of her right hand; \xE2\x80\x9Cplay, play, play!\xE2\x80\x9D

For a moment, with the fear of my sister\xE2\x80\x99s working me before my eyes, I
had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character
of Mr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s chaise-cart. But I felt myself so unequal to the
performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in
what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she said, when
we had taken a good look at each other,--

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you sullen and obstinate?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, ma\xE2\x80\x99am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can\xE2\x80\x99t play just
now. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so
I would do it if I could; but it\xE2\x80\x99s so new here, and so strange, and so
fine,--and melancholy--.\xE2\x80\x9D I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or
had already said it, and we took another look at each other.

Before she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the
dress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the
looking-glass.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo new to him,\xE2\x80\x9D she muttered, \xE2\x80\x9Cso old to me; so strange to him, so
familiar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.\xE2\x80\x9D

As she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she was
still talking to herself, and kept quiet.

\xE2\x80\x9CCall Estella,\xE2\x80\x9D she repeated, flashing a look at me. \xE2\x80\x9CYou can do that.
Call Estella. At the door.\xE2\x80\x9D

To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,
bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive,
and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name, was almost
as bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and her light came
along the dark passage like a star.

Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the
table, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her
pretty brown hair. \xE2\x80\x9CYour own, one day, my dear, and you will use it
well. Let me see you play cards with this boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith this boy? Why, he is a common laboring boy!\xE2\x80\x9D

I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,--only it seemed so
unlikely,--\xE2\x80\x9CWell? You can break his heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you play, boy?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Estella of myself, with the greatest
disdain.

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing but beggar my neighbor, miss.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBeggar him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.

It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had
stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that
Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had
taken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the dressing-table
again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had never
been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent,
and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now yellow, had been
trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything, this standing still
of all the pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on
the collapsed form could have looked so like grave-clothes, or the long
veil so like a shroud.

So she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and
trimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew nothing
then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in
ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly
seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have looked as if
the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella with disdain, before
our first game was out. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd what coarse hands he has! And what thick
boots!\xE2\x80\x9D

I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began
to consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so
strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.

She won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I
knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for
a stupid, clumsy laboring-boy.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou say nothing of her,\xE2\x80\x9D remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked
on. \xE2\x80\x9CShe says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What
do you think of her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t like to say,\xE2\x80\x9D I stammered.

\xE2\x80\x9CTell me in my ear,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham, bending down.

\xE2\x80\x9CI think she is very proud,\xE2\x80\x9D I replied, in a whisper.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnything else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think she is very pretty.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnything else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think she is very insulting.\xE2\x80\x9D (She was looking at me then with a look
of supreme aversion.)

\xE2\x80\x9CAnything else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think I should like to go home.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd never see her again, though she is so pretty?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not sure that I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t like to see her again, but I should like
to go home now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou shall go soon,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham, aloud. \xE2\x80\x9CPlay the game out.\xE2\x80\x9D

Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost
sure that Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s face could not smile. It had dropped into a
watchful and brooding expression,--most likely when all the things about
her had become transfixed,--and it looked as if nothing could ever lift
it up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice
had dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;
altogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,
within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.

I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She
threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she
despised them for having been won of me.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen shall I have you here again?\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham. \xE2\x80\x9CLet me think.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she
checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her
right hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of
weeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, ma\xE2\x80\x99am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEstella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him roam
and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she
stood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the
side entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must
necessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded me,
and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room
many hours.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are to wait here, you boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella; and disappeared and
closed the door.

I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my
coarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was
not favorable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled
me now, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever
taught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called
knaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then
I should have been so too.

She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She
put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread
and meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in
disgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,--I
cannot hit upon the right name for the smart--God knows what its name
was,--that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the
girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them.
This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she gave a
contemptuous toss--but with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure
that I was so wounded--and left me.

But when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face
in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my
sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.
As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so
bitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that
needed counteraction.

My sister\xE2\x80\x99s bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in
which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is
nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be
only small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child
is small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many
hands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within
myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with
injustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my
sister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had
cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her
no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments, disgraces,
fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed
this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a solitary and
unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid
and very sensitive.

I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the
brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my
face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat
were acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon
in spirits to look about me.

To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the
brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high
wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there
had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no pigeons
in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty, no malt in
the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat.
All the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its
last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a wilderness of empty casks,
which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about
them; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that
was gone,--and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like
most others.

Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old
wall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough
to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the
house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was
a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes walked
there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But she
seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation presented
by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw her walking on them at
the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me, and held her
pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never looked round,
and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery itself,--by which
I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer,
and where the brewing utensils still were. When I first went into it,
and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about
me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light
iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she were going
out into the sky.

It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened
to my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a
stranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes--a little dimmed by
looking up at the frosty light--towards a great wooden beam in a low
nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure
hanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but
one shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded
trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was
Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if
she were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure,
and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment
before, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror
was greatest of all when I found no figure there.

Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of
people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving
influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought
me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon
as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let
me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I
thought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.

She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that
my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the
gate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,
when she touched me with a taunting hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy don\xE2\x80\x99t you cry?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou do,\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CYou have been crying till you are half blind, and
you are near crying again now.\xE2\x80\x9D

She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.
I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s, and was immensely relieved to find
him not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I was
wanted at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s again, I set off on the four-mile walk to
our forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply
revolving that I was a common laboring-boy; that my hands were coarse;
that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit
of calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had
considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived
bad way.




Chapter IX

When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss
Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself
getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small
of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen
wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length.

If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other
young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden
in mine,--which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason
to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,--it is the key to many
reservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s as my
eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I felt
convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and although
she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression
that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging
her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before the
contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I could,
and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.

The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by
a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came
gaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details divulged
to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes and mouth
open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat heaving
with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, boy,\xE2\x80\x9D Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the
chair of honor by the fire. \xE2\x80\x9CHow did you get on up town?\xE2\x80\x9D

I answered, \xE2\x80\x9CPretty well, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D and my sister shook her fist at me.

\xE2\x80\x9CPretty well?\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Pumblechook repeated. \xE2\x80\x9CPretty well is no answer. Tell
us what you mean by pretty well, boy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy
perhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my
obstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered
as if I had discovered a new idea, \xE2\x80\x9CI mean pretty well.\xE2\x80\x9D

My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,--I
had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,--when Mr.
Pumblechook interposed with \xE2\x80\x9CNo! Don\xE2\x80\x99t lose your temper. Leave this
lad to me, ma\xE2\x80\x99am; leave this lad to me.\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Pumblechook then turned me
towards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,--

\xE2\x80\x9CFirst (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?\xE2\x80\x9D

I calculated the consequences of replying \xE2\x80\x9CFour Hundred Pound,\xE2\x80\x9D and
finding them against me, went as near the answer as I could--which was
somewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my
pence-table from \xE2\x80\x9Ctwelve pence make one shilling,\xE2\x80\x9D up to \xE2\x80\x9Cforty pence
make three and fourpence,\xE2\x80\x9D and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had
done for me, \xE2\x80\x9CNow! How much is forty-three pence?\xE2\x80\x9D To which I replied,
after a long interval of reflection, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know.\xE2\x80\x9D And I was so
aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.

Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me,
and said, \xE2\x80\x9CIs forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for
instance?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes!\xE2\x80\x9D said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was
highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and
brought him to a dead stop.

\xE2\x80\x9CBoy! What like is Miss Havisham?\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Pumblechook began again when
he had recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the
screw.

\xE2\x80\x9CVery tall and dark,\xE2\x80\x9D I told him.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs she, uncle?\xE2\x80\x9D asked my sister.

Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he had
never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. (\xE2\x80\x9CThis is the way to have him!
We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?\xE2\x80\x9D)

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure, uncle,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mrs. Joe, \xE2\x80\x9CI wish you had him always; you
know so well how to deal with him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, boy! What was she a doing of, when you went in today?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr.
Pumblechook.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe was sitting,\xE2\x80\x9D I answered, \xE2\x80\x9Cin a black velvet coach.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another--as they well
might--and both repeated, \xE2\x80\x9CIn a black velvet coach?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd Miss Estella--that\xE2\x80\x99s her niece, I think--handed her
in cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had
cake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat mine,
because she told me to.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWas anybody else there?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Pumblechook.

\xE2\x80\x9CFour dogs,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CLarge or small?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CImmense,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver
basket.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter
amazement. I was perfectly frantic,--a reckless witness under the
torture,--and would have told them anything.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere was this coach, in the name of gracious?\xE2\x80\x9D asked my sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CIn Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s room.\xE2\x80\x9D They stared again. \xE2\x80\x9CBut there weren\xE2\x80\x99t any
horses to it.\xE2\x80\x9D I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting
four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of
harnessing.

\xE2\x80\x9CCan this be possible, uncle?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mrs. Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat can the boy mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you, Mum,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook. \xE2\x80\x9CMy opinion is, it\xE2\x80\x99s a
sedan-chair. She\xE2\x80\x99s flighty, you know,--very flighty,--quite flighty
enough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you ever see her in it, uncle?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mrs. Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow could I,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, forced to the admission, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen I never see
her in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGoodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, don\xE2\x80\x99t you know,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat when I have
been there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the door
has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don\xE2\x80\x99t say you don\xE2\x80\x99t
know that, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did you play
at, boy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe played with flags,\xE2\x80\x9D I said. (I beg to observe that I think of myself
with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)

\xE2\x80\x9CFlags!\xE2\x80\x9D echoed my sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CEstella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and
Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out
at the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSwords!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated my sister. \xE2\x80\x9CWhere did you get swords from?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COut of a cupboard,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd I saw pistols in it,--and jam,--and
pills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up
with candles.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s true, Mum,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. \xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s the
state of the case, for that much I\xE2\x80\x99ve seen myself.\xE2\x80\x9D And then they
both stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my
countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers
with my right hand.

If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have
betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that
there was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement
but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear
in the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the
marvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I escaped.
The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup
of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own mind than for
the gratification of his, related my pretended experiences.

Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the
kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as
regarded him,--not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards
Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat
debating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s acquaintance
and favor. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would \xE2\x80\x9Cdo something\xE2\x80\x9D
 for me; their doubts related to the form that something would take.
My sister stood out for \xE2\x80\x9Cproperty.\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Pumblechook was in favor of a
handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade,--say,
the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the deepest
disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I might only
be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets.
\xE2\x80\x9CIf a fool\xE2\x80\x99s head can\xE2\x80\x99t express better opinions than that,\xE2\x80\x9D said my
sister, \xE2\x80\x9Cand you have got any work to do, you had better go and do it.\xE2\x80\x9D
 So he went.

After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing up,
I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had done for
the night. Then I said, \xE2\x80\x9CBefore the fire goes out, Joe, I should like to
tell you something.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShould you, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.
\xE2\x80\x9CThen tell us. What is it, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJoe,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting
it between my finger and thumb, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou remember all that about Miss
Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRemember?\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CI believe you! Wonderful!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain\xE2\x80\x99t true.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat are you telling of, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Joe, falling back in the greatest
amazement. \xE2\x80\x9CYou don\xE2\x80\x99t mean to say it\xE2\x80\x99s--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes I do; it\xE2\x80\x99s lies, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut not all of it? Why sure you don\xE2\x80\x99t mean to say, Pip, that there was
no black welwet co--eh?\xE2\x80\x9D For, I stood shaking my head. \xE2\x80\x9CBut at least
there was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, persuasively, \xE2\x80\x9Cif there
warn\xE2\x80\x99t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA dog?\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CA puppy? Come?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.\xE2\x80\x9D

As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.
\xE2\x80\x9CPip, old chap! This won\xE2\x80\x99t do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect to
go to?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s terrible, Joe; ain\xE2\x80\x99t it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTerrible?\xE2\x80\x9D cried Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CAwful! What possessed you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know what possessed me, Joe,\xE2\x80\x9D I replied, letting his shirt
sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut I wish you hadn\xE2\x80\x99t taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I
wish my boots weren\xE2\x80\x99t so thick nor my hands so coarse.\xE2\x80\x9D

And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t been
able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to
me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s
who was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I
knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies
had come of it somehow, though I didn\xE2\x80\x99t know how.

This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal
with as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of
metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s one thing you may be sure of, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, after some
rumination, \xE2\x80\x9Cnamely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn\xE2\x80\x99t
ought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to
the same. Don\xE2\x80\x99t you tell no more of \xE2\x80\x98em, Pip. That ain\xE2\x80\x99t the way to get
out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don\xE2\x80\x99t make
it out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You\xE2\x80\x99re oncommon
small. Likewise you\xE2\x80\x99re a oncommon scholar.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I\xE2\x80\x99ve
seen letters--Ah! and from gentlefolks!--that I\xE2\x80\x99ll swear weren\xE2\x80\x99t wrote
in print,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It\xE2\x80\x99s only
that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cbe it so or be it son\xE2\x80\x99t, you must be a common
scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon
his throne, with his crown upon his ed, can\xE2\x80\x99t sit and write his acts
of Parliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted
Prince, with the alphabet.--Ah!\xE2\x80\x9D added Joe, with a shake of the head
that was full of meaning, \xE2\x80\x9Cand begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.
And I know what that is to do, though I can\xE2\x80\x99t say I\xE2\x80\x99ve exactly done it.\xE2\x80\x9D

There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged
me.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhether common ones as to callings and earnings,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Joe,
reflectively, \xE2\x80\x9Cmightn\xE2\x80\x99t be the better of continuing for to keep
company with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon
ones,--which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C(I\xE2\x80\x99m sorry there weren\xE2\x80\x99t a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or
mightn\xE2\x80\x99t be, is a thing as can\xE2\x80\x99t be looked into now, without putting
your sister on the Rampage; and that\xE2\x80\x99s a thing not to be thought of as
being done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a
true friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can\xE2\x80\x99t get to
be oncommon through going straight, you\xE2\x80\x99ll never get to do it through
going crooked. So don\xE2\x80\x99t tell no more on \xE2\x80\x98em, Pip, and live well and die
happy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are not angry with me, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay
of a stunning and outdacious sort,--alluding to them which bordered on
weal-cutlets and dog-fighting,--a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,
their being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.
That\xE2\x80\x99s all, old chap, and don\xE2\x80\x99t never do it no more.\xE2\x80\x9D

When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget
Joe\xE2\x80\x99s recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and
unthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common
Estella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, and
how coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting
in the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how
Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the
level of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I \xE2\x80\x9Cused to
do\xE2\x80\x9D when I was at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s; as though I had been there weeks or
months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of
remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.

That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it
is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it,
and think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read
this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold,
of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the
formation of the first link on one memorable day.




Chapter X

The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,
that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to
get out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous
conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt\xE2\x80\x99s
at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life,
and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart
all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging of girls,
immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her promise
within five minutes.

The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt
may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples
and put straws down one another\xE2\x80\x99s backs, until Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt
collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with
a birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the
pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to
hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and
a little spelling,--that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this
volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt fell into a state of
coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils then
entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject
of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon
whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at
them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they had been
unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more illegibly printed
at the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with,
speckled all over with ironmould, and having various specimens of the
insect world smashed between their leaves. This part of the Course was
usually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory
students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave out the number of a
page, and then we all read aloud what we could,--or what we couldn\xE2\x80\x99t--in
a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high, shrill, monotonous voice,
and none of us having the least notion of, or reverence for, what we
were reading about. When this horrible din had lasted a certain time,
it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt, who staggered at a boy
fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was understood to terminate
the Course for the evening, and we emerged into the air with shrieks of
intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition
against any pupil\xE2\x80\x99s entertaining himself with a slate or even with the
ink (when there was any), but that it was not easy to pursue that branch
of study in the winter season, on account of the little general shop
in which the classes were holden--and which was also Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s
great-aunt\xE2\x80\x99s sitting-room and bedchamber--being but faintly illuminated
through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no snuffers.

It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under
these circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that
very evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some
information from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist
sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D which she
had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed,
until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.

Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe
liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders
from my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that
evening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the
Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.

There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk
scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to
be never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and
had grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our
country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it
to account.

It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly
at these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I
merely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the
end of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire,
and where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a
stranger. Joe greeted me as usual with \xE2\x80\x9CHalloa, Pip, old chap!\xE2\x80\x9D and the
moment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.

He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was
all on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were
taking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his
mouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away
and looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he
nodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit
down there.

But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of
resort, I said \xE2\x80\x9CNo, thank you, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D and fell into the space Joe made
for me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,
and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again
when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg--in a very odd way, as
it struck me.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou was saying,\xE2\x80\x9D said the strange man, turning to Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you was a
blacksmith.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. I said it, you know,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99ll you drink, Mr.--? You didn\xE2\x80\x99t mention your name, by the bye.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99ll you
drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cto tell you the truth, I ain\xE2\x80\x99t much in the habit of
drinking at anybody\xE2\x80\x99s expense but my own.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHabit? No,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the stranger, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut once and away, and on a
Saturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t wish to be stiff company,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CRum.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRum,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the stranger. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd will the other gentleman originate a
sentiment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRum,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wopsle.

\xE2\x80\x9CThree Rums!\xE2\x80\x9D cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. \xE2\x80\x9CGlasses
round!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis other gentleman,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,
\xE2\x80\x9Cis a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at
church.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAha!\xE2\x80\x9D said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. \xE2\x80\x9CThe
lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put
his legs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping
broad-brimmed traveller\xE2\x80\x99s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over his
head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he looked
at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a
half-laugh, come into his face.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a
solitary country towards the river.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMost marshes is solitary,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or
vagrants of any sort, out there?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe; \xE2\x80\x9Cnone but a runaway convict now and then. And we don\xE2\x80\x99t
find them, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;
but not warmly.

\xE2\x80\x9CSeems you have been out after such?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the stranger.

\xE2\x80\x9COnce,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CNot that we wanted to take them, you understand;
we went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn\xE2\x80\x99t us, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

The stranger looked at me again,--still cocking his eye, as if he were
expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,--and said, \xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s a
likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CChristened Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, not christened Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSurname Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a
infant, and is called by.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSon of yours?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in
anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at
the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was
discussed over pipes,--\xE2\x80\x9Cwell--no. No, he ain\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNevvy?\xE2\x80\x9D said the strange man.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, \xE2\x80\x9Che
is not--no, not to deceive you, he is not--my nevvy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat the Blue Blazes is he?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the stranger. Which appeared to me
to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.

Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships,
having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man
might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and Joe. Having
his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling
passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to think he had done quite
enough to account for it when he added, \xE2\x80\x9C--as the poet says.\xE2\x80\x9D

And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he considered
it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into
my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited
at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory
process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to mind that I
was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family
circle, but some large-handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to
patronize me.

All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at
me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me
down. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,
until the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his
shot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.

It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was
pointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at me,
and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it and
he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file.

He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it
he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be
Joe\xE2\x80\x99s file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the
instrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on his
settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally about
turnips.

There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause
before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which
stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays
than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water running out
together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CStop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,\xE2\x80\x9D said the strange man. \xE2\x80\x9CI think I\xE2\x80\x99ve
got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the boy
shall have it.\xE2\x80\x9D

He looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some
crumpled paper, and gave it to me. \xE2\x80\x9CYours!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CMind! Your own.\xE2\x80\x9D

I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,
and holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr. Wopsle
good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look with his
aiming eye,--no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may be done
with an eye by hiding it.

On the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must
have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of
the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide
open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in
a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old
acquaintance, and could think of nothing else.

My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in
the kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell
her about the bright shilling. \xE2\x80\x9CA bad un, I\xE2\x80\x99ll be bound,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Joe
triumphantly, \xE2\x80\x9Cor he wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have given it to the boy! Let\xE2\x80\x99s look at
it.\xE2\x80\x9D

I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. \xE2\x80\x9CBut what\xE2\x80\x99s
this?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the
paper. \xE2\x80\x9CTwo One-Pound notes?\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have
been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets in
the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly
Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat down
on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure
that the man would not be there.

Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,
Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.
Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under
some dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in
the state parlor. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and many
a night and day.

I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the
strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the guiltily
coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with
convicts,--a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten.
I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed me that when I least
expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed myself to sleep by
thinking of Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw
the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I
screamed myself awake.




Chapter XI

At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, and my hesitating
ring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting
me, as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage
where her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the
candle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously
saying, \xE2\x80\x9CYou are to come this way to-day,\xE2\x80\x9D and took me to quite another
part of the house.

The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square
basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,
however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and
opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in
a small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a
detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the
manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the
outer wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s room, and
like Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.

We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a
low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in
the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, \xE2\x80\x9CYou are to go and
stand there boy, till you are wanted.\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x9D, being the window, I
crossed to it, and stood \xE2\x80\x9Cthere,\xE2\x80\x9D in a very uncomfortable state of mind,
looking out.

It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the
neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree
that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new
growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if
that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This
was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been
some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;
but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden,
and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window,
as if it pelted me for coming there.

I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that
its other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room
except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in
all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.

There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had been
standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that
they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not
to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission
that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to be a toady
and humbug.

They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody\xE2\x80\x99s pleasure,
and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to
repress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded
me of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I found
when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features. Indeed, when
I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had any features
at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face.

\xE2\x80\x9CPoor dear soul!\xE2\x80\x9D said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my
sister\xE2\x80\x99s. \xE2\x80\x9CNobody\xE2\x80\x99s enemy but his own!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt would be much more commendable to be somebody else\xE2\x80\x99s enemy,\xE2\x80\x9D said
the gentleman; \xE2\x80\x9Cfar more natural.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCousin Raymond,\xE2\x80\x9D observed another lady, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe are to love our neighbor.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSarah Pocket,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Cousin Raymond, \xE2\x80\x9Cif a man is not his own
neighbor, who is?\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),
\xE2\x80\x9CThe idea!\xE2\x80\x9D But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good
idea too. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and
emphatically, \xE2\x80\x9CVery true!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPoor soul!\xE2\x80\x9D Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been looking
at me in the mean time), \xE2\x80\x9Che is so very strange! Would anyone believe
that when Tom\xE2\x80\x99s wife died, he actually could not be induced to see the
importance of the children\xE2\x80\x99s having the deepest of trimmings to their
mourning? \xE2\x80\x98Good Lord!\xE2\x80\x99 says he, \xE2\x80\x98Camilla, what can it signify so long
as the poor bereaved little things are in black?\xE2\x80\x99 So like Matthew! The
idea!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood points in him, good points in him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Cousin Raymond; \xE2\x80\x9CHeaven
forbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never
will have, any sense of the proprieties.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know I was obliged,\xE2\x80\x9D said Camilla,--\xE2\x80\x9CI was obliged to be firm. I
said, \xE2\x80\x98It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.\xE2\x80\x99 I told him that,
without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from
breakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out
in his violent way, and said, with a D, \xE2\x80\x98Then do as you like.\xE2\x80\x99 Thank
Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly
went out in a pouring rain and bought the things.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe paid for them, did he not?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Estella.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,\xE2\x80\x9D returned
Camilla. \xE2\x80\x9CI bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,
when I wake up in the night.\xE2\x80\x9D

The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or
call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation
and caused Estella to say to me, \xE2\x80\x9CNow, boy!\xE2\x80\x9D On my turning round, they
all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard
Sarah Pocket say, \xE2\x80\x9CWell I am sure! What next!\xE2\x80\x9D and Camilla add, with
indignation, \xE2\x80\x9CWas there ever such a fancy! The i-de-a!\xE2\x80\x9D

As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella stopped
all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting manner, with
her face quite close to mine,--

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, miss?\xE2\x80\x9D I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.

She stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.

\xE2\x80\x9CAm I pretty?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; I think you are very pretty.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAm I insulting?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot so much so as you were last time,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot so much so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

She fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face with
such force as she had, when I answered it.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow?\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CYou little coarse monster, what do you think of me
now?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall not tell you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s not it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy don\xE2\x80\x99t you cry again, you little wretch?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause I\xE2\x80\x99ll never cry for you again,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. Which was, I suppose, as
false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for her
then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.

We went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going
up, we met a gentleman groping his way down.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhom have we here?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.

\xE2\x80\x9CA boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella.

He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an
exceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin
in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the
light of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head, and
had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t lie down but stood up bristling.
His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were disagreeably sharp and
suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and strong black dots where his
beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them. He was nothing
to me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he ever would be
anything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing
him well.

\xE2\x80\x9CBoy of the neighborhood? Hey?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow do you come here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham sent for me, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D I explained.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and
you\xE2\x80\x99re a bad set of fellows. Now mind!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, biting the side of his
great forefinger as he frowned at me, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou behave yourself!\xE2\x80\x9D

With those words, he released me--which I was glad of, for his hand
smelt of scented soap--and went his way downstairs. I wondered whether
he could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn\xE2\x80\x99t be a doctor, or he
would have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much time
to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s room, where
she and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella left me
standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her
eyes upon me from the dressing-table.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo!\xE2\x80\x9D she said, without being startled or surprised: \xE2\x80\x9Cthe days have worn
away, have they?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, ma\xE2\x80\x99am. To-day is--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere, there, there!\xE2\x80\x9D with the impatient movement of her fingers. \xE2\x80\x9CI
don\xE2\x80\x99t want to know. Are you ready to play?\xE2\x80\x9D

I was obliged to answer in some confusion, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t think I am, ma\xE2\x80\x99am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot at cards again?\xE2\x80\x9D she demanded, with a searching look.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, ma\xE2\x80\x99am; I could do that, if I was wanted.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSince this house strikes you old and grave, boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham,
impatiently, \xE2\x80\x9Cand you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?\xE2\x80\x9D

I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to
find for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen go into that opposite room,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, pointing at the door behind
me with her withered hand, \xE2\x80\x9Cand wait there till I come.\xE2\x80\x9D

I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.
From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an
airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in
the damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than
to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder
than the clearer air,--like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry branches
of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the chamber; or it
would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its darkness. It was
spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible
thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces. The
most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it,
as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all
stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the
middle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its
form was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow
expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black
fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home
to it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest
public importance had just transpired in the spider community.

I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same
occurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles took
no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous
elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not
on terms with one another.

These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching
them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.
In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned, and
she looked like the Witch of the place.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, \xE2\x80\x9Cis where I
will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.\xE2\x80\x9D

With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and
there and die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork
at the Fair, I shrank under her touch.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you think that is?\xE2\x80\x9D she asked me, again pointing with her
stick; \xE2\x80\x9Cthat, where those cobwebs are?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t guess what it is, ma\xE2\x80\x99am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!\xE2\x80\x9D

She looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,
leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, \xE2\x80\x9CCome, come, come!
Walk me, walk me!\xE2\x80\x9D

I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss
Havisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and
she leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have
been an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.
Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s chaise-cart.

She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, \xE2\x80\x9CSlower!\xE2\x80\x9D
 Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she
twitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to
believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a
while she said, \xE2\x80\x9CCall Estella!\xE2\x80\x9D so I went out on the landing and
roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light
appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round
and round the room.

If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should
have felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the
three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn\xE2\x80\x99t know
what to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss
Havisham twitched my shoulder, and we posted on,--with a shame-faced
consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Miss Havisham,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Sarah Pocket. \xE2\x80\x9CHow well you look!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Miss Havisham. \xE2\x80\x9CI am yellow skin and bone.\xE2\x80\x9D

Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she
murmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, \xE2\x80\x9CPoor dear
soul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd how are you?\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to
Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss
Havisham wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly
obnoxious to Camilla.

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you, Miss Havisham,\xE2\x80\x9D she returned, \xE2\x80\x9CI am as well as can be
expected.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, what\xE2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding
sharpness.

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing worth mentioning,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Camilla. \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t wish to make a
display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the
night than I am quite equal to.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen don\xE2\x80\x99t think of me,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Miss Havisham.

\xE2\x80\x9CVery easily said!\xE2\x80\x9D remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a
hitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. \xE2\x80\x9CRaymond is a
witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.
Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings
and nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with
anxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,
I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure
I wish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night--The
idea!\xE2\x80\x9D Here, a burst of tears.

The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and
him I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this point,
and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, \xE2\x80\x9CCamilla, my dear, it
is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to
the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not aware,\xE2\x80\x9D observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but
once, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that
person, my dear.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated
old woman, with a small face that might have been made of walnut-shells,
and a large mouth like a cat\xE2\x80\x99s without the whiskers, supported this
position by saying, \xE2\x80\x9CNo, indeed, my dear. Hem!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThinking is easy enough,\xE2\x80\x9D said the grave lady.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is easier, you know?\xE2\x80\x9D assented Miss Sarah Pocket.

\xE2\x80\x9COh, yes, yes!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to
rise from her legs to her bosom. \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s all very true! It\xE2\x80\x99s a weakness
to be so affectionate, but I can\xE2\x80\x99t help it. No doubt my health would be
much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t change my disposition
if I could. It\xE2\x80\x99s the cause of much suffering, but it\xE2\x80\x99s a consolation to
know I posses it, when I wake up in the night.\xE2\x80\x9D Here another burst of
feeling.

Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going
round and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the
visitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s Matthew!\xE2\x80\x9D said Camilla. \xE2\x80\x9CNever mixing with any natural ties,
never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa
with my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my head
over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don\xE2\x80\x99t know where--\xE2\x80\x9D

(\xE2\x80\x9CMuch higher than your head, my love,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Camilla.)

\xE2\x80\x9CI have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of
Matthew\xE2\x80\x99s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CReally I must say I should think not!\xE2\x80\x9D interposed the grave lady.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou see, my dear,\xE2\x80\x9D added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious
personage), \xE2\x80\x9Cthe question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to
thank you, my love?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWithout expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,\xE2\x80\x9D resumed
Camilla, \xE2\x80\x9CI have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond
is a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total
inefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte
tuner\xE2\x80\x99s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even
supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,--and now to be told--\xE2\x80\x9D
 Here Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical
as to the formation of new combinations there.

When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and
herself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great
influence in bringing Camilla\xE2\x80\x99s chemistry to a sudden end.

\xE2\x80\x9CMatthew will come and see me at last,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham, sternly,
\xE2\x80\x9Cwhen I am laid on that table. That will be his place,--there,\xE2\x80\x9D striking
the table with her stick, \xE2\x80\x9Cat my head! And yours will be there! And your
husband\xE2\x80\x99s there! And Sarah Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s there! And Georgiana\xE2\x80\x99s there! Now
you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me.
And now go!\xE2\x80\x9D

At the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in
a new place. She now said, \xE2\x80\x9CWalk me, walk me!\xE2\x80\x9D and we went on again.

\xE2\x80\x9CI suppose there\xE2\x80\x99s nothing to be done,\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Camilla, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut comply
and depart. It\xE2\x80\x99s something to have seen the object of one\xE2\x80\x99s love and
duty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy
satisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have
that comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a
display of my feelings, but it\xE2\x80\x99s very hard to be told one wants to feast
on one\xE2\x80\x99s relations,--as if one was a Giant,--and to be told to go. The
bare idea!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving
bosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I
supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of
view, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah
Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was
too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful
slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah
Pocket then made her separate effect of departing with, \xE2\x80\x9CBless you, Miss
Havisham dear!\xE2\x80\x9D and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut-shell
countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.

While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked
with her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she
stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it
some seconds,--

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is my birthday, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t suffer it to be spoken of. I don\xE2\x80\x99t suffer those who were here
just now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but they
dare not refer to it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Of course I made no further effort to refer to it.

\xE2\x80\x9COn this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of
decay,\xE2\x80\x9D stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the
table, but not touching it, \xE2\x80\x9Cwas brought here. It and I have worn away
together. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of
mice have gnawed at me.\xE2\x80\x9D

She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking
at the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the
once white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state
to crumble under a touch.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen the ruin is complete,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, with a ghastly look, \xE2\x80\x9Cand when
they lay me dead, in my bride\xE2\x80\x99s dress on the bride\xE2\x80\x99s table,--which shall
be done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,--so much the
better if it is done on this day!\xE2\x80\x9D

She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure
lying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too remained
quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. In
the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its
remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might
presently begin to decay.

At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an
instant, Miss Havisham said, \xE2\x80\x9CLet me see you two play cards; why have
you not begun?\xE2\x80\x9D With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as
before; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham
watched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella\xE2\x80\x99s beauty, and
made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella\xE2\x80\x99s breast and
hair.

Estella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that she
did not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games,
a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard
to be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left to
wander about as I liked.

It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which
I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last
occasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I
saw one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let
the visitors out,--for she had returned with the keys in her hand,--I
strolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a
wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,
which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of
weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a weedy
offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.

When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but
a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal
corner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for
a moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,
and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a
pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.

This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me.
He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him, and I
now saw that he was inky.

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cyoung fellow!\xE2\x80\x9D

Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to
be best answered by itself, I said, \xE2\x80\x9CHalloa!\xE2\x80\x9D politely omitting young
fellow.

\xE2\x80\x9CWho let you in?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Estella.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho gave you leave to prowl about?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Estella.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCome and fight,\xE2\x80\x9D said the pale young gentleman.

What could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question
since; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was
so astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a
spell.

\xE2\x80\x9CStop a minute, though,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, wheeling round before we had gone many
paces. \xE2\x80\x9CI ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it is!\xE2\x80\x9D
 In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one
another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my hair,
slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my stomach.

The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was
unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was
particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit out
at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, \xE2\x80\x9CAha! Would you?\xE2\x80\x9D
 and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled
within my limited experience.

\xE2\x80\x9CLaws of the game!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to
his right. \xE2\x80\x9CRegular rules!\xE2\x80\x9D Here, he skipped from his right leg on to
his left. \xE2\x80\x9CCome to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!\xE2\x80\x9D Here,
he dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I
looked helplessly at him.

I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt
morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have
had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to
consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I
followed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by
the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking me
if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he begged my
leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle
of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. \xE2\x80\x9CAvailable for both,\xE2\x80\x9D he said,
placing these against the wall. And then fell to pulling off, not
only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a manner at once
light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.

Although he did not look very healthy,--having pimples on his face, and
a breaking out at his mouth,--these dreadful preparations quite appalled
me. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he
had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For
the rest, he was a young gentleman in a gray suit (when not denuded
for battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in
advance of the rest of him as to development.

My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every
demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were
minutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,
as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his
back, looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly
fore-shortened.

But, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with
a great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest
surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,
looking up at me out of a black eye.

His spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no
strength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked down;
but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out
of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself
according to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made
me believe he really was going to do for me at last. He got heavily
bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him, the harder I
hit him; but he came up again and again and again, until at last he got
a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall. Even after that
crisis in our affairs, he got up and turned round and round confusedly a
few times, not knowing where I was; but finally went on his knees to his
sponge and threw it up: at the same time panting out, \xE2\x80\x9CThat means you
have won.\xE2\x80\x9D

He seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the
contest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go
so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of
savage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly
wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, \xE2\x80\x9CCan I help you?\xE2\x80\x9D
 and he said \xE2\x80\x9CNo thankee,\xE2\x80\x9D and I said \xE2\x80\x9CGood afternoon,\xE2\x80\x9D and he said \xE2\x80\x9CSame
to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.
But she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her
waiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though something
had happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the gate, too,
she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome here! You may kiss me, if you like.\xE2\x80\x9D

I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone
through a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was
given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and
that it was worth nothing.

What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with
the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light
on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against
a black night-sky, and Joe\xE2\x80\x99s furnace was flinging a path of fire across
the road.




Chapter XII

My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman. The
more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman on
his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the
more certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt that
the pale young gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s blood was on my head, and that the Law would
avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had
incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking
about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into
the studious youth of England, without laying themselves open to severe
punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at
the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going
on an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon
me. The pale young gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s nose had stained my trousers, and I tried
to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night. I had cut
my knuckles against the pale young gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s teeth, and I twisted my
imagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of
accounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before
the Judges.

When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of
violence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of Justice,
specially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush behind the
gate;--whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for
an outrage done to her house, might rise in those grave-clothes of hers,
draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:--whether suborned boys--a numerous
band of mercenaries--might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery,
and cuff me until I was no more;--it was high testimony to my confidence
in the spirit of the pale young gentleman, that I never imagined him
accessory to these retaliations; they always came into my mind as the
acts of injudicious relatives of his, goaded on by the state of his
visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features.

However, go to Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s I must, and go I did. And behold! nothing
came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale
young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I found the same
gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows
of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed
shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner where
the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young
gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s existence. There were traces of his gore in that spot, and I
covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.

On the broad landing between Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s own room and that other
room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,--a
light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed
there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular
occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired of
walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and across
the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over again,
we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as
three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general mention of
these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled that I should
return every alternate day at noon for these purposes, and because I am
now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months.

As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more
to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was
I going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I
believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know
everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that
desirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my
being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,--or anything
but my daily dinner,--nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my
services.

Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told
me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;
sometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite
familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she
hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were
alone, \xE2\x80\x9CDoes she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D And when I said yes
(for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we
played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of
Estella\xE2\x80\x99s moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were
so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what
to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness,
murmuring something in her ear that sounded like \xE2\x80\x9CBreak their hearts my
pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!\xE2\x80\x9D

There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the
burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering
homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation
towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon
iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem\xE2\x80\x99s
respected name. Thus, you were to hammer boys round--Old Clem! With a
thump and a sound--Old Clem! Beat it out, beat it out--Old Clem! With a
clink for the stout--Old Clem! Blow the fire, blow the fire--Old
Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher--Old Clem! One day soon after the
appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the
impatient movement of her fingers, \xE2\x80\x9CThere, there, there! Sing!\xE2\x80\x9D I was
surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor. It
happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding
voice as if she were singing in her sleep. After that, it became
customary with us to have it as we moved about, and Estella would often
join in; though the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were
three of us, that it made less noise in the grim old house than the
lightest breath of wind.

What could I become with these surroundings? How could my character fail
to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were
dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the
misty yellow rooms?

Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had
not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which
I had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly
fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger
to be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of him.
Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed,
which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time
went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told
poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy
had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did not know then, though
I think I know now.

Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with
almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,
Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of
discussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to
this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these hands
could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would have done
it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind, that
he could not discuss my prospects without having me before him,--as it
were, to operate upon,--and he would drag me up from my stool (usually
by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me before the
fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying, \xE2\x80\x9CNow, Mum,
here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by hand. Hold up
your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which so did do. Now,
Mum, with respections to this boy!\xE2\x80\x9D And then he would rumple my hair
the wrong way,--which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted,
I have in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do,--and
would hold me before him by the sleeve,--a spectacle of imbecility only
to be equalled by himself.

Then, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations
about Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,
that I used to want--quite painfully--to burst into spiteful tears, fly
at Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister
spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at
every reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,
would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of
my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.

In these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,
while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe\xE2\x80\x99s perceiving that
he was not favorable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old
enough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on
his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my
sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition
on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out of his
hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating end to
every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to lead up to
it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching sight of me as
it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, \xE2\x80\x9CCome! there\xE2\x80\x99s enough of
you! You get along to bed; you\xE2\x80\x99ve given trouble enough for one night, I
hope!\xE2\x80\x9D As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out.

We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we
should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss
Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my
shoulder; and said with some displeasure,--

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are growing tall, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D

I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that
this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control.

She said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at me
again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and moody.
On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was over, and
I had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a movement of
her impatient fingers:--

\xE2\x80\x9CTell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJoe Gargery, ma\xE2\x80\x99am.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMeaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Miss Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with
you, and bring your indentures, do you think?\xE2\x80\x9D

I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be
asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen let him come.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt any particular time, Miss Havisham?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come
along with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister
\xE2\x80\x9Cwent on the Rampage,\xE2\x80\x9D in a more alarming degree than at any previous
period. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats under
our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we graciously
thought she was fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent of such
inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing,
got out the dustpan,--which was always a very bad sign,--put on her
coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not satisfied
with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush, and cleaned
us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the back-yard.
It was ten o\xE2\x80\x99clock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and
then she asked Joe why he hadn\xE2\x80\x99t married a Negress Slave at once?
Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker and
looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have been a
better speculation.




Chapter XIII

It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see
Joe arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss
Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the
occasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his
working-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so dreadfully
uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for me he pulled
up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the
crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.

At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town with
us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s and called for \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen we had
done with our fine ladies\xE2\x80\x9D--a way of putting the case, from which Joe
appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the day,
and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to do on
the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable
HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the
direction he had taken.

We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver
bonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited
Straw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it
was a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were
carried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were
displayed as articles of property,--much as Cleopatra or any other
sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or
procession.

When we came to Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s, my sister bounced in and left us. As it
was almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s house.
Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe took
his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands; as if
he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a
quarter of an ounce.

Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew
so well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked back
at Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the
greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of
his toes.

Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff
and conducted him into Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s presence. She was seated at her
dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said she to Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CYou are the husband of the sister of this boy?\xE2\x80\x9D

I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or
so like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with his
tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are the husband,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Miss Havisham, \xE2\x80\x9Cof the sister of this
boy?\xE2\x80\x9D

It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in
addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich I meantersay, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe now observed in a manner that was at
once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great
politeness, \xE2\x80\x9Cas I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time
what you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd you have reared the boy, with the
intention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cas you and me were ever friends, and it
were looked for\xE2\x80\x99ard to betwixt us, as being calc\xE2\x80\x99lated to lead to
larks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the
business,--such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,--not
but what they would have been attended to, don\xE2\x80\x99t you see?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHas the boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham, \xE2\x80\x9Cever made any objection? Does he
like the trade?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Joe, strengthening
his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat
it were the wish of your own hart.\xE2\x80\x9D (I saw the idea suddenly break upon
him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion, before he went on
to say) \xE2\x80\x9CAnd there weren\xE2\x80\x99t no objection on your part, and Pip it were
the great wish of your hart!\xE2\x80\x9D

It was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he
ought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures
to him to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he
persisted in being to Me.

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you brought his indentures with you?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Miss Havisham.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Pip, you know,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Joe, as if that were a little
unreasonable, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou yourself see me put \xE2\x80\x98em in my \xE2\x80\x98at, and therefore you
know as they are here.\xE2\x80\x9D With which he took them out, and gave them, not
to Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good
fellow,--I know I was ashamed of him,--when I saw that Estella stood
at the back of Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s chair, and that her eyes laughed
mischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to
Miss Havisham.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou expected,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, \xE2\x80\x9Cno premium
with the boy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJoe!\xE2\x80\x9D I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. \xE2\x80\x9CWhy don\xE2\x80\x99t you
answer--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPip,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhich I
meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself
and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it to
be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was
better than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took
up a little bag from the table beside her.

\xE2\x80\x9CPip has earned a premium here,\xE2\x80\x9D she said, \xE2\x80\x9Cand here it is. There are
five-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in
him by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,
persisted in addressing me.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is wery liberal on your part, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cand it is as such
received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,
nor nowheres. And now, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, conveying to me a sensation,
first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar
expression were applied to Miss Havisham,--\xE2\x80\x9Cand now, old chap, may we
do our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and another,
and by them which your liberal present--have-conweyed--to be--for the
satisfaction of mind-of--them as never--\xE2\x80\x9D here Joe showed that he felt
he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly rescued
himself with the words, \xE2\x80\x9Cand from myself far be it!\xE2\x80\x9D These words had
such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood-bye, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham. \xE2\x80\x9CLet them out, Estella.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAm I to come again, Miss Havisham?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!\xE2\x80\x9D

Thus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe
in a distinct emphatic voice, \xE2\x80\x9CThe boy has been a good boy here, and
that is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no
other and no more.\xE2\x80\x9D

How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but
I know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs
instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went
after him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the
gate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the
daylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,
\xE2\x80\x9CAstonishing!\xE2\x80\x9D And there he remained so long saying, \xE2\x80\x9CAstonishing\xE2\x80\x9D at
intervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming
back. At length he prolonged his remark into \xE2\x80\x9CPip, I do assure you this
is as-TON-ishing!\xE2\x80\x9D and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to
walk away.

I have reason to think that Joe\xE2\x80\x99s intellects were brightened by the
encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s
he invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in
what took place in Mr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s parlor: where, on our presenting
ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D cried my sister, addressing us both at once. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd what\xE2\x80\x99s
happened to you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor
society as this, I am sure I do!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of
remembrance, \xE2\x80\x9Cmade it wery partick\xE2\x80\x99ler that we should give her--were it
compliments or respects, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCompliments,\xE2\x80\x9D I said.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich that were my own belief,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Joe; \xE2\x80\x9Cher compliments to Mrs.
J. Gargery--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMuch good they\xE2\x80\x99ll do me!\xE2\x80\x9D observed my sister; but rather gratified too.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd wishing,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another
effort of remembrance, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat the state of Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s elth were
sitch as would have--allowed, were it, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf her having the pleasure,\xE2\x80\x9D I added.

\xE2\x80\x9COf ladies\xE2\x80\x99 company,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. And drew a long breath.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.
\xE2\x80\x9CShe might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but
it\xE2\x80\x99s better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole
here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShe giv\xE2\x80\x99 him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cnothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat she giv\xE2\x80\x99,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe giv\xE2\x80\x99 to his friends. \xE2\x80\x98And by his
friends,\xE2\x80\x99 were her explanation, \xE2\x80\x98I mean into the hands of his sister
Mrs. J. Gargery.\xE2\x80\x99 Them were her words; \xE2\x80\x98Mrs. J. Gargery.\xE2\x80\x99 She mayn\xE2\x80\x99t
have know\xE2\x80\x99d,\xE2\x80\x9D added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether it
were Joe, or Jorge.\xE2\x80\x9D

My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden
arm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all
about it beforehand.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd how much have you got?\xE2\x80\x9D asked my sister, laughing. Positively
laughing!

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat would present company say to ten pound?\xE2\x80\x9D demanded Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey\xE2\x80\x99d say,\xE2\x80\x9D returned my sister, curtly, \xE2\x80\x9Cpretty well. Not too much,
but pretty well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s more than that, then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he
rubbed the arms of his chair, \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s more than that, Mum.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, you don\xE2\x80\x99t mean to say--\xE2\x80\x9D began my sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes I do, Mum,\xE2\x80\x9D said Pumblechook; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good
in you! Go on!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat would present company say,\xE2\x80\x9D proceeded Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cto twenty pound?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHandsome would be the word,\xE2\x80\x9D returned my sister.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s more than twenty pound.\xE2\x80\x9D

That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a
patronizing laugh, \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her up,
Joseph!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen to make an end of it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my
sister; \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s five-and-twenty pound.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s five-and-twenty pound, Mum,\xE2\x80\x9D echoed that basest of swindlers,
Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; \xE2\x80\x9Cand it\xE2\x80\x99s no more than your
merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy of the
money!\xE2\x80\x9D

If the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently
awful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody,
with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far
behind.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow you see, Joseph and wife,\xE2\x80\x9D said Pumblechook, as he took me by the
arm above the elbow, \xE2\x80\x9CI am one of them that always go right through with
what they\xE2\x80\x99ve begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That\xE2\x80\x99s my way.
Bound out of hand.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGoodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,\xE2\x80\x9D said my sister (grasping the
money), \xE2\x80\x9Cwe\xE2\x80\x99re deeply beholden to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever mind me, Mum,\xE2\x80\x9D returned that diabolical cornchandler. \xE2\x80\x9CA
pleasure\xE2\x80\x99s a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we
must have him bound. I said I\xE2\x80\x99d see to it--to tell you the truth.\xE2\x80\x9D

The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at
once went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial
presence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,
exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed,
it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed;
for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd, I heard some
people say, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s he done?\xE2\x80\x9D and others, \xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s a young \xE2\x80\x98un, too, but
looks bad, don\xE2\x80\x99t he?\xE2\x80\x9D One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave
me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted
up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled TO BE READ IN MY
CELL.

The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a
church,--and with people hanging over the pews looking on,--and with
mighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with
folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading
the newspapers,--and with some shining black portraits on the walls,
which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and
sticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and
attested, and I was \xE2\x80\x9Cbound\xE2\x80\x9D; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while
as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little
preliminaries disposed of.

When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put
into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured,
and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely
rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s. And there my sister
became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve
her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar, and
that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles
and Mr. Wopsle.

It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For,
it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole
company, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it
worse, they all asked me from time to time,--in short, whenever they
had nothing else to do,--why I didn\xE2\x80\x99t enjoy myself? And what could I
possibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself,--when I wasn\xE2\x80\x99t!

However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the
most of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent
contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;
and, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had
fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I
played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,
or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared
to contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair
beside him to illustrate his remarks.

My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off, woke me up
and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle
gave us Collins\xE2\x80\x99s ode, and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder
down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and said, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Commercials
underneath sent up their compliments, and it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t the Tumblers\xE2\x80\x99 Arms.\xE2\x80\x9D
 That, they were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang, O
Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously
strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece
of music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about
everybody\xE2\x80\x99s private affairs) that he was the man with his white locks
flowing, and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going.

Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly
wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like
Joe\xE2\x80\x99s trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.




Chapter XIV

It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be black
ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well
deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.

Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister\xE2\x80\x99s
temper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had
believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon; I had believed
in the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose
solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had
believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment;
I had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and
independence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all
coarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella
see it on any account.

How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,
how much Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, how much my sister\xE2\x80\x99s, is now of no moment to
me or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well or
ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.

Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my
shirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x98prentice, I should be
distinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt
that I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight
upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have
been occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I have
felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest
and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more.
Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in
life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road
of apprenticeship to Joe.

I remember that at a later period of my \xE2\x80\x9Ctime,\xE2\x80\x9D I used to stand about
the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my
own perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness
between them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both
there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite
as dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that
after-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe
while my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I am glad to know
of myself in that connection.

For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I
proceed to add was Joe\xE2\x80\x99s. It was not because I was faithful, but because
Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or
a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of
industry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,
that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible
to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing
man flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has
touched one\xE2\x80\x99s self in going by, and I know right well that any good that
intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe,
and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.

What I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew? What
I dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and
commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one
of the wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she
would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing
the coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.
Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were
singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss
Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s would seem to show me Estella\xE2\x80\x99s face in the fire, with her
pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,--often at
such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall
which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just
drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last.

After that, when we went into supper, the place and the meal would have
a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than
ever, in my own ungracious breast.




Chapter XV

As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt\xE2\x80\x99s room, my
education under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however, until
Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little catalogue
of prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a half-penny.
Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were
the opening lines.

     When I went to Lunnon town sirs,
     Too rul loo rul
     Too rul loo rul
     Wasn\xE2\x80\x99t I done very brown sirs?
     Too rul loo rul
     Too rul loo rul

--still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I
thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the
poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to
bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he kindly complied.
As it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for a dramatic
lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied
and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon
declined that course of instruction; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his
poetic fury had severely mauled me.

Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds so
well, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted
to make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my
society and less open to Estella\xE2\x80\x99s reproach.

The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken
slate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational implements:
to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew Joe to
remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my
tuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he would smoke his pipe
at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else,--even
with a learned air,--as if he considered himself to be advancing
immensely. Dear fellow, I hope he did.

It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing
beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking
as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the
bottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea
with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and
Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud
or sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the same.--Miss
Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared
to have something to do with everything that was picturesque.

One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself on
being \xE2\x80\x9Cmost awful dull,\xE2\x80\x9D that I had given him up for the day, I lay on
the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of
Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the
water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them
that had been much in my head.

\xE2\x80\x9CJoe,\xE2\x80\x9D said I; \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Joe, slowly considering. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat for, Joe? What is any visit made for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is some wisits p\xE2\x80\x99r\xE2\x80\x99aps,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cas for ever remains open to
the question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might
think you wanted something,--expected something of her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t you think I might say that I did not, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou might, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd she might credit it. Similarly she
mightn\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard
at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou see, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, \xE2\x80\x9CMiss
Havisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the
handsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were
all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Joe. I heard her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CALL,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe repeated, very emphatically.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,--Make a
end on it!--As you was!--Me to the North, and you to the South!--Keep in
sunders!\xE2\x80\x9D

I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me
to find that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more
probable.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, old chap.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHere am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day
of my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after
her, or shown that I remember her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes
all four round,--and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all
four round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of
hoofs--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don\xE2\x80\x99t mean a present.\xE2\x80\x9D

But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it.
\xE2\x80\x9COr even,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you was helped to knocking her up a new chain
for the front door,--or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for
general use,--or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork
when she took her muffins,--or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such
like--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t mean any present at all, Joe,\xE2\x80\x9D I interposed.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly
pressed it, \xE2\x80\x9Cif I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t. No, I would not. For
what\xE2\x80\x99s a door-chain when she\xE2\x80\x99s got one always up? And shark-headers is
open to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you\xE2\x80\x99d go into
brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can\xE2\x80\x99t show
himself oncommon in a gridiron,--for a gridiron IS a gridiron,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring to
rouse me from a fixed delusion, \xE2\x80\x9Cand you may haim at what you like, but
a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave,
and you can\xE2\x80\x99t help yourself--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Joe,\xE2\x80\x9D I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t
go on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all
along; \xE2\x80\x9Cand what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack
just now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would
go uptown and make a call on Miss Est--Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich her name,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, gravely, \xE2\x80\x9Cain\xE2\x80\x99t Estavisham, Pip, unless she
have been rechris\xE2\x80\x99ened.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,
Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

In brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of
it. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received
with cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a
visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a
favor received, then this experimental trip should have no successor. By
these conditions I promised to abide.

Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick.
He pretended that his Christian name was Dolge,--a clear
Impossibility,--but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I
believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but
wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its
understanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of
great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even
seemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere
accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner, or
went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew,
as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever
coming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper\xE2\x80\x99s out on the marshes, and on
working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his hands in
his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck
and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the
sluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,
locomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or
otherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,
half-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it
was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.

This morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and
timid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner
of the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was
necessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy, and
that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x98prentice, Orlick
was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him;
howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything, or did
anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he always beat
his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, he came
in out of time.

Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of
my half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just
got a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by
and by he said, leaning on his hammer,--

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, master! Sure you\xE2\x80\x99re not a going to favor only one of us. If Young
Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.\xE2\x80\x9D I suppose he was
about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient
person.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, what\xE2\x80\x99ll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99ll I do with it! What\xE2\x80\x99ll he do with it? I\xE2\x80\x99ll do as much with it as
him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Orlick.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs to Pip, he\xE2\x80\x99s going up town,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell then, as to Old Orlick, he\xE2\x80\x99s a going up town,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted that
worthy. \xE2\x80\x9CTwo can go up town. Tain\xE2\x80\x99t only one wot can go up town.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t lose your temper,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CShall if I like,\xE2\x80\x9D growled Orlick. \xE2\x80\x9CSome and their uptowning! Now,
master! Come. No favoring in this shop. Be a man!\xE2\x80\x9D

The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in
a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot
bar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,
whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,--as
if it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,--and
finally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and he
again leaned on his hammer,--

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, master!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you all right now?\xE2\x80\x9D demanded Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! I am all right,\xE2\x80\x9D said gruff Old Orlick.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Clet it be a half-holiday for all.\xE2\x80\x9D

My sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,--she was
a most unscrupulous spy and listener,--and she instantly looked in at
one of the windows.

\xE2\x80\x9CLike you, you fool!\xE2\x80\x9D said she to Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cgiving holidays to great idle
hulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in
that way. I wish I was his master!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99d be everybody\xE2\x80\x99s master, if you durst,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Orlick, with an
ill-favored grin.

(\xE2\x80\x9CLet her alone,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.)

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99d be a match for all noodles and all rogues,\xE2\x80\x9D returned my sister,
beginning to work herself into a mighty rage. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t be a
match for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who\xE2\x80\x99s the
dunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t be a match for the
rogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and
the worst rogue between this and France. Now!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,\xE2\x80\x9D growled the journeyman. \xE2\x80\x9CIf that
makes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good\xE2\x80\x99un.\xE2\x80\x9D

(\xE2\x80\x9CLet her alone, will you?\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.)

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat did you say?\xE2\x80\x9D cried my sister, beginning to scream. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat did you
say? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,
with my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!\xE2\x80\x9D Each of these exclamations was
a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of all
the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for
her, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she
consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself
into it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat was the
name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold me!
Oh!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh-h-h!\xE2\x80\x9D growled the journeyman, between his teeth, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99d hold you, if
you was my wife. I\xE2\x80\x99d hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.\xE2\x80\x9D

(\xE2\x80\x9CI tell you, let her alone,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.)

\xE2\x80\x9COh! To hear him!\xE2\x80\x9D cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a
scream together,--which was her next stage. \xE2\x80\x9CTo hear the names he\xE2\x80\x99s
giving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my
husband standing by! Oh! Oh!\xE2\x80\x9D Here my sister, after a fit of clappings
and screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and
threw her cap off, and pulled her hair down,--which were the last stages
on her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete
success, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.

What could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical
interruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he meant
by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether he was
man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of
nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence straightway; so,
without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons, they went
at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in that neighborhood
could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man. Orlick, as if he
had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman, was very
soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come out of it. Then Joe
unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had dropped insensible
at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I think), and who was
carried into the house and laid down, and who was recommended to revive,
and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in Joe\xE2\x80\x99s hair.
Then, came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars; and
then, with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such
a lull,--namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead,--I went upstairs
to dress myself.

When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any
other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick\xE2\x80\x99s nostrils,
which was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared
from the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a
peaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on
Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation
that might do me good, \xE2\x80\x9COn the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage,
Pip:--such is Life!\xE2\x80\x9D

With what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very
serious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to
Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed
the gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how
I debated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should
undoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.

Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow, then? You here again?\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Pocket. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you want?\xE2\x80\x9D

When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah
evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my
business. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in, and
presently brought the sharp message that I was to \xE2\x80\x9Ccome up.\xE2\x80\x9D

Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D said she, fixing her eyes upon me. \xE2\x80\x9CI hope you want nothing?
You\xE2\x80\x99ll get nothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing
very well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere, there!\xE2\x80\x9D with the old restless fingers. \xE2\x80\x9CCome now and then; come
on your birthday.--Ay!\xE2\x80\x9D she cried suddenly, turning herself and her
chair towards me, \xE2\x80\x9CYou are looking round for Estella? Hey?\xE2\x80\x9D

I had been looking round,--in fact, for Estella,--and I stammered that I
hoped she was well.

\xE2\x80\x9CAbroad,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham; \xE2\x80\x9Ceducating for a lady; far out of reach;
prettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you
have lost her?\xE2\x80\x9D

There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words,
and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a loss what
to say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me. When
the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut-shell countenance, I
felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with
everything; and that was all I took by that motion.

As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at
the shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,
who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in
his hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that
moment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on
the head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner
did he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence
had put a \xE2\x80\x98prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,
and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlor. As I
knew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the
way was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better
than none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into
Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s just as the street and the shops were lighting up.

As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I
don\xE2\x80\x99t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it
took until half-past nine o\xE2\x80\x99 clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle
got into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he became
so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career. I
thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short
in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to seed, leaf
after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was a
mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the
identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When
Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively apologetic,
Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle, too, took
pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and maudlin, I
was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever;
Millwood put me down in argument, on every occasion; it became sheer
monomania in my master\xE2\x80\x99s daughter to care a button for me; and all I can
say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning, is,
that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character. Even after
I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book, Pumblechook sat
staring at me, and shaking his head, and saying, \xE2\x80\x9CTake warning, boy,
take warning!\xE2\x80\x9D as if it were a well-known fact that I contemplated
murdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one to have the
weakness to become my benefactor.

It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with
Mr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and
it fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the
lamp\xE2\x80\x99s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on
the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a
change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon
a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa!\xE2\x80\x9D we said, stopping. \xE2\x80\x9COrlick there?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D he answered, slouching out. \xE2\x80\x9CI was standing by a minute, on the
chance of company.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are late,\xE2\x80\x9D I remarked.

Orlick not unnaturally answered, \xE2\x80\x9CWell? And you\xE2\x80\x99re late.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have been,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,--\xE2\x80\x9Cwe
have been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.\xE2\x80\x9D

Old Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all
went on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending his
half-holiday up and down town?

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Call of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn\xE2\x80\x99t see you,
but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns is
going again.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt the Hulks?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CAy! There\xE2\x80\x99s some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been
going since dark, about. You\xE2\x80\x99ll hear one presently.\xE2\x80\x9D

In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the
well-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily
rolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing
and threatening the fugitives.

\xE2\x80\x9CA good night for cutting off in,\xE2\x80\x9D said Orlick. \xE2\x80\x9CWe\xE2\x80\x99d be puzzled how to
bring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.\xE2\x80\x9D

The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in
silence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening\xE2\x80\x99s tragedy,
fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick, with his
hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very dark,
very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the sound
of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along
the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my thoughts. Mr.
Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game on Bosworth
Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick sometimes
growled, \xE2\x80\x9CBeat it out, beat it out,--Old Clem! With a clink for the
stout,--Old Clem!\xE2\x80\x9D I thought he had been drinking, but he was not drunk.

Thus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us
past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find--it being
eleven o\xE2\x80\x99clock--in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and
unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered
about. Mr. Wopsle dropped into ask what was the matter (surmising that
a convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s something wrong,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, without stopping, \xE2\x80\x9Cup at your place,
Pip. Run all!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.

\xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t quite understand. The house seems to have been violently
entered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has
been attacked and hurt.\xE2\x80\x9D

We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no
stop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole
village was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there
was Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst
of the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,
and so I became aware of my sister,--lying without sense or movement on
the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow
on the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was
turned towards the fire,--destined never to be on the Rampage again,
while she was the wife of Joe.




Chapter XVI

With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe
that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister, or at
all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under
obligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than
any one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began to
reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides, I
took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.

Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a
quarter after eight o\xE2\x80\x99clock to a quarter before ten. While he was there,
my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged
Good Night with a farm-laborer going home. The man could not be more
particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into dense
confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been before nine.
When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found her struck down
on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The fire had not then
burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle very long; the
candle, however, had been blown out.

Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond
the blowing out of the candle,--which stood on a table between the door
and my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was
struck,--was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such
as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one
remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with
something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were
dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable
violence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when Joe
picked her up, was a convict\xE2\x80\x99s leg-iron which had been filed asunder.

Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith\xE2\x80\x99s eye, declared it to have
been filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the
Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe\xE2\x80\x99s opinion
was corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the
prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they claimed
to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by
either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further, one of
those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his iron.

Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed
the iron to be my convict\xE2\x80\x99s iron,--the iron I had seen and heard him
filing at, on the marshes,--but my mind did not accuse him of having put
it to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have
become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.
Either Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.

Now, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we
picked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the
evening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and
he had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against
him, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with
everybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if
he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute
about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore them.
Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so
silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could look
round.

It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however
undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered unspeakable
trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last
dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story. For
months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally in the
negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The contention
came, after all, to this;--the secret was such an old one now, had so
grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not tear it
away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much mischief,
it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he
believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe
it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a
monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of course--for,
was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing is always
done?--and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any
such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the
assailant.

The Constables and the Bow Street men from London--for, this happened in
the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police--were about the house for
a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like
authorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously
wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,
and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead
of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood
about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks
that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a
mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as
taking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.

Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very
ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects multiplied,
and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the
realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and her
speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as to
be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by
her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in
speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than indifferent
speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary
complications arose between them which I was always called in to solve.
The administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of
Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own
mistakes.

However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A
tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a
part of her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three
months, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then remain
for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We were
at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a circumstance
happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt conquered a
confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen, and Biddy became a
part of our establishment.

It may have been about a month after my sister\xE2\x80\x99s reappearance in the
kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the
whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.
Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly
cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had
been accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me
every now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, \xE2\x80\x9CSuch a fine
figure of a woman as she once were, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D Biddy instantly taking the
cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe
became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,
and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did
him good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had all
more or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that they
had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits
they had ever encountered.

Biddy\xE2\x80\x99s first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty
that had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made
nothing of it. Thus it was:--

Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a
character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost
eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly
wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,
from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the
sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my
sister\xE2\x80\x99s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a
qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after
another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape
being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed
it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook her head to
that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her
weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.

When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this
mysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully
at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked
thoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his
initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, of course!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Biddy, with an exultant face. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t you see?
It\xE2\x80\x99s him!\xE2\x80\x9D

Orlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify
him by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the
kitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his
arm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching
out, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly
distinguished him.

I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I
was disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest
anxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his
being at length produced, and motioned that she would have him
given something to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were
particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception,
she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and there was an air
of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have seen pervade the
bearing of a child towards a hard master. After that day, a day rarely
passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate, and without Orlick\xE2\x80\x99s
slouching in and standing doggedly before her, as if he knew no more
than I did what to make of it.




Chapter XVII

I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was
varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more
remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying
another visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty
at the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she spoke
of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words. The
interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I was
going, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention at
once that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking the
guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her
to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after that, I took
it.

So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened
room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that
I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that
mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew
older, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my
thoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact. It
bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my
trade and to be ashamed of home.

Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her
shoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands were
always clean. She was not beautiful,--she was common, and could not be
like Estella,--but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.
She had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly
out of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself one
evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that
were very pretty and very good.

It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring
at--writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at
once by a sort of stratagem--and seeing Biddy observant of what I was
about. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without
laying it down.

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Chow do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you
are very clever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it that I manage? I don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Biddy, smiling.

She managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not
mean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow do you manage, Biddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cto learn everything that I learn,
and always to keep up with me?\xE2\x80\x9D I was beginning to be rather vain of
my knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the
greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no
doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.

\xE2\x80\x9CI might as well ask you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, \xE2\x80\x9Chow you manage?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see
me turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI suppose I must catch it like a cough,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, quietly; and went
on with her sewing.

Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at
Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather
an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was equally
accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different
sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy
knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or
better.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are one of those, Biddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cwho make the most of every
chance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how
improved you are!\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. \xE2\x80\x9CI was
your first teacher though; wasn\xE2\x80\x99t I?\xE2\x80\x9D said she, as she sewed.

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy!\xE2\x80\x9D I exclaimed, in amazement. \xE2\x80\x9CWhy, you are crying!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo I am not,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, looking up and laughing. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat put that in
your head?\xE2\x80\x9D

What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it
dropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been
until Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of
living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled
the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the
miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,
with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and
shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must
have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first
uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of
course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I
looked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps
I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too
reserved, and should have patronized her more (though I did not use that
precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Biddy,\xE2\x80\x9D I observed, when I had done turning it over, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou were my
first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being
together like this, in this kitchen.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh, poor thing!\xE2\x80\x9D replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to
transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,
making her more comfortable; \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s sadly true!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe must talk together a little more, as we used to do.
And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a
quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.\xE2\x80\x9D

My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook
the care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out
together. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed the
village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes
and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to
combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my usual way.
When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank, with the water
rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been
without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and place for the
admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, after binding her to secrecy, \xE2\x80\x9CI want to be a
gentleman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO, I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t, if I was you!\xE2\x80\x9D she returned. \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t think it would
answer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, with some severity, \xE2\x80\x9CI have particular reasons for
wanting to be a gentleman.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know best, Pip; but don\xE2\x80\x99t you think you are happier as you are?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D I exclaimed, impatiently, \xE2\x80\x9CI am not at all happy as I am. I
am disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to
either, since I was bound. Don\xE2\x80\x99t be absurd.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWas I absurd?\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; \xE2\x80\x9CI am sorry
for that; I didn\xE2\x80\x99t mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be
comfortable.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be
comfortable--or anything but miserable--there, Biddy!--unless I can lead
a very different sort of life from the life I lead now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s a pity!\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.

Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of
quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined
to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her
sentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I knew it was much
to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I could have settled down,\xE2\x80\x9D I said to Biddy, plucking up the short
grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings
out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,--\xE2\x80\x9Cif I could have
settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was
little, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe
would have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone
partners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to
keep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine
Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for you;
shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t I, Biddy?\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for
answer, \xE2\x80\x9CYes; I am not over-particular.\xE2\x80\x9D It scarcely sounded flattering,
but I knew she meant well.

\xE2\x80\x9CInstead of that,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or
two, \xE2\x80\x9Csee how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and--what
would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me
so!\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more
attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,\xE2\x80\x9D she
remarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. \xE2\x80\x9CWho said it?\xE2\x80\x9D

I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where
I was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I
answered, \xE2\x80\x9CThe beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, and she\xE2\x80\x99s more
beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I want
to be a gentleman on her account.\xE2\x80\x9D Having made this lunatic confession,
I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some
thoughts of following it.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?\xE2\x80\x9D Biddy
quietly asked me, after a pause.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D I moodily answered.

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause, if it is to spite her,\xE2\x80\x9D Biddy pursued, \xE2\x80\x9CI should think--but
you know best--that might be better and more independently done by
caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should
think--but you know best--she was not worth gaining over.\xE2\x80\x9D

Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was
perfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed
village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and
wisest of men fall every day?

\xE2\x80\x9CIt may be all quite true,\xE2\x80\x9D said I to Biddy, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I admire her
dreadfully.\xE2\x80\x9D

In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good
grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All the
while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced,
that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I
had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a
punishment for belonging to such an idiot.

Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.
She put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work,
upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair.
Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face
upon my sleeve I cried a little,--exactly as I had done in the brewery
yard,--and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used by
somebody, or by everybody; I can\xE2\x80\x99t say which.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am glad of one thing,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, \xE2\x80\x9Cand that is, that you have felt
you could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,
and that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it
and always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a poor
one, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your teacher
at the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would set. But
it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her, and it\xE2\x80\x99s
of no use now.\xE2\x80\x9D So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank,
and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, \xE2\x80\x9CShall we walk a
little farther, or go home?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving
her a kiss, \xE2\x80\x9CI shall always tell you everything.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTill you\xE2\x80\x99re a gentleman,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know I never shall be, so that\xE2\x80\x99s always. Not that I have any
occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,--as I
told you at home the other night.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.
And then repeated, with her former pleasant change, \xE2\x80\x9Cshall we walk a
little farther, or go home?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the
summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very
beautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and
wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing
beggar my neighbor by candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks,
and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good for me if
I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances
and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do,
and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked myself the question
whether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that
moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable? I was obliged to
admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, \xE2\x80\x9CPip,
what a fool you are!\xE2\x80\x9D

We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed
right. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and
somebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no
pleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her own
breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her much
the better of the two?

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, when we were walking homeward, \xE2\x80\x9CI wish you could put me
right.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish I could!\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I could only get myself to fall in love with you,--you don\xE2\x80\x99t mind my
speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh dear, not at all!\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t mind me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you never will, you see,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy.

It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would have
done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore observed
I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she was, and she said it
decisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet I took it
rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.

When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and
get over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate, or
from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant way),
Old Orlick.

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa!\xE2\x80\x9D he growled, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhere are you two going?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere should we be going, but home?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, then,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m jiggered if I don\xE2\x80\x99t see you home!\xE2\x80\x9D

This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of
his. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but
used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and
convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger, I
had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he would
have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.

Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,
\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t let him come; I don\xE2\x80\x99t like him.\xE2\x80\x9D As I did not like him either,
I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn\xE2\x80\x99t want
seeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of
laughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little
distance.

Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in
that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any
account, I asked her why she did not like him.

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,
\xE2\x80\x9Cbecause I--I am afraid he likes me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid he ever tell you he liked you?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked indignantly.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, \xE2\x80\x9Che never told me
so; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.\xE2\x80\x9D

However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not
doubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon
Old Orlick\xE2\x80\x99s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on
myself.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut it makes no difference to you, you know,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, calmly.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don\xE2\x80\x99t like it; I don\xE2\x80\x99t
approve of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNor I neither,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy. \xE2\x80\x9CThough that makes no difference to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CExactly,\xE2\x80\x9D said I; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I must tell you I should have no opinion of you,
Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.\xE2\x80\x9D

I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances
were favorable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that
demonstration. He had struck root in Joe\xE2\x80\x99s establishment, by reason
of my sister\xE2\x80\x99s sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him
dismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I
had reason to know thereafter.

And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated
its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I
was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the
plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to
be ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect
and happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my
disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was
growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company
with Biddy,--when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the
Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter
my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often
before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in all
directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss Havisham
was going to make my fortune when my time was out.

If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my
perplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was brought
to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.




Chapter XVIII

It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a
Saturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three
Jolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.
Of that group I was one.

A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued
in blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective
in the description, and identified himself with every witness at the
Inquest. He faintly moaned, \xE2\x80\x9CI am done for,\xE2\x80\x9D as the victim, and he
barbarously bellowed, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll serve you out,\xE2\x80\x9D as the murderer. He gave the
medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner; and
he piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows, to
an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental
competency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s hands, became
Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyed himself thoroughly,
and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable. In this
cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder.

Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over
the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an expression
of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he
watched the group of faces.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou
have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?\xE2\x80\x9D

Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He looked
at everybody coldly and sarcastically.

\xE2\x80\x9CGuilty, of course?\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9COut with it. Come!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSir,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Wopsle, \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout having the honor of your
acquaintance, I do say Guilty.\xE2\x80\x9D Upon this we all took courage to unite
in a confirmatory murmur.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know you do,\xE2\x80\x9D said the stranger; \xE2\x80\x9CI knew you would. I told you so.
But now I\xE2\x80\x99ll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know,
that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is
proved--proved--to be guilty?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSir,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Wopsle began to reply, \xE2\x80\x9Cas an Englishman myself, I--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCome!\xE2\x80\x9D said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t evade
the question. Either you know it, or you don\xE2\x80\x99t know it. Which is it to
be?\xE2\x80\x9D

He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a
bullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.
Wopsle,--as it were to mark him out--before biting it again.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CDo you know it, or don\xE2\x80\x99t you know it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly I know it,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Wopsle.

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly you know it. Then why didn\xE2\x80\x99t you say so at first? Now, I\xE2\x80\x99ll
ask you another question,\xE2\x80\x9D--taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he
had a right to him,--\xE2\x80\x9Cdo you know that none of these witnesses have yet
been cross-examined?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Wopsle was beginning, \xE2\x80\x9CI can only say--\xE2\x80\x9D when the stranger stopped
him.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat? You won\xE2\x80\x99t answer the question, yes or no? Now, I\xE2\x80\x99ll try you
again.\xE2\x80\x9D Throwing his finger at him again. \xE2\x80\x9CAttend to me. Are you
aware, or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been
cross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion
of him.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome!\xE2\x80\x9D said the stranger, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll help you. You don\xE2\x80\x99t deserve help, but
I\xE2\x80\x99ll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious
manner, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe printed paper you have just been reading from?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUndoubtedly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUndoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly
states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers
instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI read that just now,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Wopsle pleaded.

\xE2\x80\x9CNever mind what you read just now, sir; I don\xE2\x80\x99t ask you what you read
just now. You may read the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer backwards, if you like,--and,
perhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my
friend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to
the bottom, to the bottom.\xE2\x80\x9D (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of
subterfuge.) \xE2\x80\x9CWell? Have you found it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHere it is,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wopsle.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it
distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was
instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come! Do
you make that of it?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Wopsle answered, \xE2\x80\x9CThose are not the exact words.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot the exact words!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the gentleman bitterly. \xE2\x80\x9CIs that the
exact substance?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wopsle.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company
with his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd now I ask
you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that passage
before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having
pronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?\xE2\x80\x9D

We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought
him, and that he was beginning to be found out.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd that same man, remember,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued the gentleman, throwing his
finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,--\xE2\x80\x9Cthat same man might be summoned as a
juryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed himself,
might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his
pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the
issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the
bar, and would a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help
him God!\xE2\x80\x9D

We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too
far, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet
time.

The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and
with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of
us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose
it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two
settles, in front of the fire, where he remained standing, his left hand
in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of his right.

\xE2\x80\x9CFrom information I have received,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, looking round at us as we
all quailed before him, \xE2\x80\x9CI have reason to believe there is a blacksmith
among you, by name Joseph--or Joe--Gargery. Which is the man?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHere is the man,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have an apprentice,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued the stranger, \xE2\x80\x9Ccommonly known as Pip?
Is he here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am here!\xE2\x80\x9D I cried.

The stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized him as the gentleman
I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss
Havisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle,
and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder,
I checked off again in detail his large head, his dark complexion, his
deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large watch-chain, his
strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented
soap on his great hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish to have a private conference with you two,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, when he had
surveyed me at his leisure. \xE2\x80\x9CIt will take a little time. Perhaps we
had better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my
communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you
please to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.\xE2\x80\x9D

Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,
and in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange
gentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of
his finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as
an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door.
Our conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by
one candle.

It began with the strange gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s sitting down at the table, drawing
the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his pocket-book.
He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside, after
peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to ascertain which was
which.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy name,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, \xE2\x80\x9Cis Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am
pretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I
commence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice
had been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you
see me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I
do. No less, no more.\xE2\x80\x9D

Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got
up, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus
having one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of
this young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his
indentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for
so doing?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip\xE2\x80\x99s way,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Joe, staring.

\xE2\x80\x9CLord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr.
Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CThe question is, Would you want anything? Do you want
anything?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe answer is,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Joe, sternly, \xE2\x80\x9CNo.\xE2\x80\x9D

I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool for
his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between breathless
curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.

\xE2\x80\x9CVery well,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CRecollect the admission you have made,
and don\xE2\x80\x99t try to go from it presently.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho\xE2\x80\x99s a going to try?\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I do keep a dog.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.
Bear that in mind, will you?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes
and nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.
\xE2\x80\x9CNow, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to
make is, that he has great expectations.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am instructed to communicate to him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, throwing
his finger at me sideways, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he will come into a handsome property.
Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that
property, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life
and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,--in a word, as a
young fellow of great expectations.\xE2\x80\x9D

My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss
Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued the lawyer, \xE2\x80\x9CI address the rest of what I have
to say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request
of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear
the name of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great
expectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have
any objection, this is the time to mention it.\xE2\x80\x9D

My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,
that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.

\xE2\x80\x9CI should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that
the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound
secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered to mention
that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by
word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be carried
out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now, you are
distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from
making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however
distant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the
communications you may have with me. If you have a suspicion in your own
breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast. It is not the least to
the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are; they may be the
strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere whim. This is not for
you to inquire into. The condition is laid down. Your acceptance of it,
and your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition
that I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions,
and for whom I am not otherwise responsible. That person is the person
from whom you derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by
that person and by me. Again, not a very difficult condition with which
to encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it,
this is the time to mention it. Speak out.\xE2\x80\x9D

Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.

\xE2\x80\x9CI should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.\xE2\x80\x9D
 Though he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he still
could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now
he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he
spoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my
disparagement, if he only chose to mention them. \xE2\x80\x9CWe come next, to mere
details of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used
the term \xE2\x80\x98expectations\xE2\x80\x99 more than once, you are not endowed with
expectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money
amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will
please consider me your guardian. Oh!\xE2\x80\x9D for I was going to thank him, \xE2\x80\x9CI
tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t render them.
It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance with
your altered position, and that you will be alive to the importance and
necessity of at once entering on that advantage.\xE2\x80\x9D

I said I had always longed for it.

\xE2\x80\x9CNever mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D he retorted;
\xE2\x80\x9Ckeep to the record. If you long for it now, that\xE2\x80\x99s enough. Am I
answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper
tutor? Is that it?\xE2\x80\x9D

I stammered yes, that was it.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don\xE2\x80\x99t think that
wise, mind, but it\xE2\x80\x99s my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you
would prefer to another?\xE2\x80\x9D

I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s great-aunt;
so, I replied in the negative.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think
might suit the purpose,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t recommend him,
observe; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is
one Mr. Matthew Pocket.\xE2\x80\x9D

Ah! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s relation. The Matthew
whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose place was to
be at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s head, when she lay dead, in her bride\xE2\x80\x99s dress on
the bride\xE2\x80\x99s table.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know the name?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then
shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.

My answer was, that I had heard of the name.

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CYou have heard of the name. But the question is, what do
you say of it?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his
recommendation--

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, my young friend!\xE2\x80\x9D he interrupted, shaking his great head very
slowly. \xE2\x80\x9CRecollect yourself!\xE2\x80\x9D

Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him
for his recommendation--

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, my young friend,\xE2\x80\x9D he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning and
smiling both at once,--\xE2\x80\x9Cno, no, no; it\xE2\x80\x99s very well done, but it won\xE2\x80\x99t
do; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not the word,
Mr. Pip. Try another.\xE2\x80\x9D

Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention
of Mr. Matthew Pocket--

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s more like it!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Jaggers.--And (I added), I would
gladly try that gentleman.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be
prepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. When
will you come to London?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I
supposed I could come directly.

\xE2\x80\x9CFirst,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou should have some new clothes to come in,
and they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You\xE2\x80\x99ll want
some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?\xE2\x80\x9D

He produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them
out on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he
had taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he
had pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am!\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, in a very decided manner.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt were understood,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd it are understood. And it ever will
be similar according.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut what,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,--\xE2\x80\x9Cwhat if it was in my
instructions to make you a present, as compensation?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs compensation what for?\xE2\x80\x9D Joe demanded.

\xE2\x80\x9CFor the loss of his services.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have
often thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or
pat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. \xE2\x80\x9CPip
is that hearty welcome,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cto go free with his services, to
honor and fortun\xE2\x80\x99, as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money
can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child--what come
to the forge--and ever the best of friends!--\xE2\x80\x9D

O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I
see you again, with your muscular blacksmith\xE2\x80\x99s arm before your eyes,
and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good
faithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm,
as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel\xE2\x80\x99s wing!

But I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future
fortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I
begged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best
of friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes
with his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but
said not another word.

Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the
village idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said, weighing
in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:--

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half
measures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge
to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the contrary you
mean to say--\xE2\x80\x9D Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped by Joe\xE2\x80\x99s
suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic
purpose.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich I meantersay,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat if you come into my place
bull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if
you\xE2\x80\x99re a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay
and stand or fall by!\xE2\x80\x9D

I drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to
me, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any
one whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a going to be
bull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when
Joe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing
any inclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory
remarks. They were these.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here--as you are to be a
gentleman--the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall
receive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a hackney-coach
at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to me.
Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust
I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now, understand
that, finally. Understand that!\xE2\x80\x9D

He was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone
on, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.

Something came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he was
going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired carriage.

\xE2\x80\x9CI beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, facing round, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat\xE2\x80\x99s the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;
so I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my taking
leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t mean in the village only, but up town?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CNo objection.\xE2\x80\x9D

I thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had already
locked the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated
by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the
burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals,
and nothing was said for a long time.

My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at her
needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next Joe
in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the glowing
coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the longer the
silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.

At length I got out, \xE2\x80\x9CJoe, have you told Biddy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his
knees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to make
off somewhere, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhich I left it to yourself, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI would rather you told, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPip\xE2\x80\x99s a gentleman of fortun\xE2\x80\x99 then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cand God bless him in
it!\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked
at me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily
congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their
congratulations that I rather resented.

I took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with the
grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say
nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in good
time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save
that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron. Biddy
nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again,
and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining his
knees, said, \xE2\x80\x9CAy, ay, I\xE2\x80\x99ll be ekervally partickler, Pip;\xE2\x80\x9D and then they
congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at the
notion of my being a gentleman that I didn\xE2\x80\x99t half like it.

Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea
of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely
failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even
repeated after Biddy, the words \xE2\x80\x9CPip\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CProperty.\xE2\x80\x9D But I doubt if
they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest
a darker picture of her state of mind.

I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and
Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.
Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is
possible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied
with myself.

Any how, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,
looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and
about what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I
caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they
often looked at me,--particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they
were expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did
by word or sign.

At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen
door opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to
air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid
I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic
objects among which I had passed my life.

\xE2\x80\x9CSaturday night,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese
and beer. \xE2\x80\x9CFive more days, and then the day before the day! They\xE2\x80\x99ll soon
go.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.
\xE2\x80\x9CThey\xE2\x80\x99ll soon go.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSoon, soon go,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and
order my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I\xE2\x80\x99ll come and put
them on there, or that I\xE2\x80\x99ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s. It
would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure
too, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese on
it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper
as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. \xE2\x80\x9CSo might
Wopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s just what I don\xE2\x80\x99t want, Joe. They would make such a business of
it,--such a coarse and common business,--that I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t bear myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh, that indeed, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CIf you couldn\xE2\x80\x99t abear yourself--\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister\xE2\x80\x99s plate, \xE2\x80\x9CHave you
thought about when you\xE2\x80\x99ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister
and me? You will show yourself to us; won\xE2\x80\x99t you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned with some resentment, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are so exceedingly quick
that it\xE2\x80\x99s difficult to keep up with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

(\xE2\x80\x9CShe always were quick,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Joe.)

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say
that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,--most likely
on the evening before I go away.\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an
affectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I got
into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean
little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for
ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at
the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind
between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in
so often between the forge and Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, and Biddy and Estella.

The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and
the room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw
Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two
in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and light
it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that he
wanted comforting, for some reason or other.

He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his pipe,
and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew that they
talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both
of them more than once. I would not have listened for more, if I could
have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and sat down in my one
chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this
first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever
known.

Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe\xE2\x80\x99s pipe
floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,--not
obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared
together. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy
bed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.




Chapter XIX

Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,
and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay
heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened
between me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of
a misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and
that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean
gone.

Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our
approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After
breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best
parlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With
all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and
thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have read that about the rich man
and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.

After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off
the marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I
felt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion
for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after
Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the
low green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them
one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a
dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of
condescension, upon everybody in the village.

If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my
companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those
graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled
the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and badge! My
comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he had doubtless
been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to me, and might
be veritably dead into the bargain.

No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these
grazing cattle,--though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a
more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they
might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great
expectations,--farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,
henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith\xE2\x80\x99s work in
general, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,
lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended
me for Estella, fell asleep.

When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,
smoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my
eyes, and said,--

\xE2\x80\x9CAs being the last time, Pip, I thought I\xE2\x80\x99d foller.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Joe, I am very glad you did so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThankee, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may be sure, dear Joe,\xE2\x80\x9D I went on, after we had shaken hands, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat
I shall never forget you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, in a comfortable tone, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m sure of that. Ay,
ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round in
a man\xE2\x80\x99s mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time to get it
well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn\xE2\x80\x99t it?\xE2\x80\x9D

Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe\xE2\x80\x99s being so mightily secure of
me. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,
\xE2\x80\x9CIt does you credit, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D or something of that sort. Therefore, I made
no remark on Joe\xE2\x80\x99s first head; merely saying as to his second, that the
tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a
gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I
were one.

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you though?\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CAstonishing!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s a pity now, Joe,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you did not get on a little more,
when we had our lessons here; isn\xE2\x80\x99t it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, I don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m so awful dull. I\xE2\x80\x99m only master
of my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it\xE2\x80\x99s
no more of a pity now, than it was--this day twelvemonth--don\xE2\x80\x99t you
see?\xE2\x80\x9D

What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to
do something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he
had been better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly
innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to
Biddy in preference.

So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our
little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a
general way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never forget
her, said I had a favor to ask of her.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd it is, Biddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you will not omit any opportunity of
helping Joe on, a little.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow helping him on?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! Joe is a dear good fellow,--in fact, I think he is the dearest
fellow that ever lived,--but he is rather backward in some things. For
instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.\xE2\x80\x9D

Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her
eyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.

\xE2\x80\x9CO, his manners! won\xE2\x80\x99t his manners do then?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Biddy, plucking a
black-currant leaf.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Biddy, they do very well here--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO! they do very well here?\xE2\x80\x9D interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the
leaf in her hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CHear me out,--but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I
shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would
hardly do him justice.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd don\xE2\x80\x99t you think he knows that?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Biddy.

It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most
distant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,--

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy, what do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,--and the
smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening
in the little garden by the side of the lane,--said, \xE2\x80\x9CHave you never
considered that he may be proud?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CProud?\xE2\x80\x9D I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.

\xE2\x80\x9CO! there are many kinds of pride,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, looking full at me and
shaking her head; \xE2\x80\x9Cpride is not all of one kind--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell? What are you stopping for?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot all of one kind,\xE2\x80\x9D resumed Biddy. \xE2\x80\x9CHe may be too proud to let any
one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills well
and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it sounds
bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Biddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI am very sorry to see this in you. I did not
expect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You
are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can\xE2\x80\x99t help
showing it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you have the heart to think so,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Biddy, \xE2\x80\x9Csay so. Say so
over and over again, if you have the heart to think so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, in a virtuous
and superior tone; \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t put it off upon me. I am very sorry to see it,
and it\xE2\x80\x99s a--it\xE2\x80\x99s a bad side of human nature. I did intend to ask you
to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of
improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am extremely
sorry to see this in you, Biddy,\xE2\x80\x9D I repeated. \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s a--it\xE2\x80\x99s a bad side
of human nature.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhether you scold me or approve of me,\xE2\x80\x9D returned poor Biddy, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou may
equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here,
at all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make
no difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be
unjust neither,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, turning away her head.

I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in which
sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I
was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and
Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a
dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and
strange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as
lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.

But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to
Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I had,
I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,
and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his
breakfast in the parlor behind his shop, and who did not think it worth
his while to come out to me, but called me into him.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. \xE2\x80\x9CHow are
you, and what can I do for you?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and was
slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a
prosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous
little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let into
the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that heaps of
his prosperity were put away in it in bags.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Trabb,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s an unpleasant thing to have to mention,
because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome
property.\xE2\x80\x9D

A change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up from
the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming, \xE2\x80\x9CLord
bless my soul!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going up to my guardian in London,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, casually drawing some
guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; \xE2\x80\x9Cand I want a fashionable
suit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,\xE2\x80\x9D I added--otherwise I
thought he might only pretend to make them, \xE2\x80\x9Cwith ready money.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened
his arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each
elbow, \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate
you? Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.
When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his
labors by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into
the shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible
corners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with any
blacksmith, alive or dead.

\xE2\x80\x9CHold that noise,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, \xE2\x80\x9Cor I\xE2\x80\x99ll
knock your head off!--Do me the favor to be seated, sir. Now, this,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a
flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand under
it to show the gloss, \xE2\x80\x9Cis a very sweet article. I can recommend it for
your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you shall
see some others. Give me Number Four, you!\xE2\x80\x9D (To the boy, and with a
dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant\xE2\x80\x99s
brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)

Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had
deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.
Then he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd let
me have none of your tricks here,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Trabb, \xE2\x80\x9Cor you shall repent
it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential
confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an
article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that
it would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished
fellow-townsman\xE2\x80\x99s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having
worn. \xE2\x80\x9CAre you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr.
Trabb to the boy after that, \xE2\x80\x9Cor shall I kick you out of the shop and
bring them myself?\xE2\x80\x9D

I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s
judgment, and re-entered the parlor to be measured. For although Mr.
Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented
with it, he said apologetically that it \xE2\x80\x9Cwouldn\xE2\x80\x99t do under existing
circumstances, sir,--wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t do at all.\xE2\x80\x9D So, Mr. Trabb measured and
calculated me in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he the finest
species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that
I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his
pains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles
to Mr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand
upon the parlor lock, \xE2\x80\x9CI know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be
expected to patronize local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a
turn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem
it. Good morning, sir, much obliged.--Door!\xE2\x80\x9D

The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what
it meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his
hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money
was, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy.

After this memorable event, I went to the hatter\xE2\x80\x99s, and the bootmaker\xE2\x80\x99s,
and the hosier\xE2\x80\x99s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard\xE2\x80\x99s dog whose outfit
required the services of so many trades. I also went to the coach-office
and took my place for seven o\xE2\x80\x99clock on Saturday morning. It was
not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome
property; but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that
the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through
the window by the High Street, and concentrated his mind upon me. When
I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards
Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s, and, as I approached that gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s place of business,
I saw him standing at his door.

He was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with
the chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had
prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor, and he too ordered
his shopman to \xE2\x80\x9Ccome out of the gangway\xE2\x80\x9D as my sacred person passed.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear friend,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when
he and I and the collation were alone, \xE2\x80\x9CI give you joy of your good
fortune. Well deserved, well deserved!\xE2\x80\x9D

This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of
expressing himself.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo think,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for
some moments, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I should have been the humble instrument of leading
up to this, is a proud reward.\xE2\x80\x9D

I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or
hinted, on that point.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear young friend,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook; \xE2\x80\x9Cif you will allow me to
call you so--\xE2\x80\x9D

I murmured \xE2\x80\x9CCertainly,\xE2\x80\x9D and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again,
and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an emotional
appearance, though it was rather low down, \xE2\x80\x9CMy dear young friend, rely
upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before
the mind of Joseph.--Joseph!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, in the way of a
compassionate adjuration. \xE2\x80\x9CJoseph!! Joseph!!!\xE2\x80\x9D Thereupon he shook his
head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut my dear young friend,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou must be hungry,
you must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the
Boar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here\xE2\x80\x99s one or two little
things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise. But do
I,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he had sat
down, \xE2\x80\x9Csee afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of happy
infancy? And may I--may I--?\xE2\x80\x9D

This May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was fervent,
and then sat down again.

\xE2\x80\x9CHere is wine,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook. \xE2\x80\x9CLet us drink, Thanks to Fortune,
and may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment! And yet I
cannot,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, \xE2\x80\x9Csee afore me One--and
likewise drink to One--without again expressing--May I--may I--?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his glass
and turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned myself
upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more direct to
my head.

Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of
tongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and
took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. \xE2\x80\x9CAh! poultry,
poultry! You little thought,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the
fowl in the dish, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen you was a young fledgling, what was in store for
you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble
roof for one as--Call it a weakness, if you will,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook,
getting up again, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut may I? may I--?\xE2\x80\x9D

It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so
he did it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself
with my knife, I don\xE2\x80\x99t know.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd your sister,\xE2\x80\x9D he resumed, after a little steady eating, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhich had
the honor of bringing you up by hand! It\xE2\x80\x99s a sad picter, to reflect that
she\xE2\x80\x99s no longer equal to fully understanding the honor. May--\xE2\x80\x9D

I saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe\xE2\x80\x99ll drink her health,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid
with admiration, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s the way you know \xE2\x80\x98em, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D (I don\xE2\x80\x99t know
who Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person
present); \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever forgiving
and ever affable. It might,\xE2\x80\x9D said the servile Pumblechook, putting down
his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, \xE2\x80\x9Cto a common person,
have the appearance of repeating--but may I--?\xE2\x80\x9D

When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. \xE2\x80\x9CLet us
never be blind,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, \xE2\x80\x9Cto her faults of temper, but it
is to be hoped she meant well.\xE2\x80\x9D

At about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in
the face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.

I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes
sent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I
mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,
and he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he
intimated, worthy of my confidence, and--in short, might he? Then he
asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we
had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he
had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken
ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he
never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of
hearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling
convinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a
sensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.

By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask my
advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was an
opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed
trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred
before in that or any other neighborhood. What alone was wanting to the
realization of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.
Those were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him
(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through a
sleeping partner, sir,--which sleeping partner would have nothing to
do but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine
the books,--and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his
pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,--it appeared to him that that
might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with
property, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?
He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it
as my opinion. \xE2\x80\x9CWait a bit!\xE2\x80\x9D The united vastness and distinctness of
this view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake hands
with me, but said he really must,--and did.

We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over
again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don\xE2\x80\x99t know what mark), and to
render me efficient and constant service (I don\xE2\x80\x99t know what service). He
also made known to me for the first time in my life, and certainly after
having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had always said of me,
\xE2\x80\x9CThat boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun\xE2\x80\x99 will be no common
fortun\xE2\x80\x99.\xE2\x80\x9D He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to
think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out into the air, with
a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the
sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without
having taken any account of the road.

There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s hailing me. He was a long way
down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to
stop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, my dear friend,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.
\xE2\x80\x9CNot if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without
that affability on your part.--May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?
May I?\xE2\x80\x9D

We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young
carter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed
me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the
road; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge
before I pursued my way home.

I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little
I possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that same
afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next
morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.

So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I
went to Mr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to
Miss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s own room was given up to me to dress
in, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My
clothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new
and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell
a trifle short of the wearer\xE2\x80\x99s expectation. But after I had had my
new suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of
posturing with Mr. Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s very limited dressing-glass, in the
futile endeavor to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being
market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook
was not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave, and
was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing. This was
all as it should be, and I went out in my new array, fearfully ashamed
of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious after all that I was at a
personal disadvantage, something like Joe\xE2\x80\x99s in his Sunday suit.

I went circuitously to Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s by all the back ways, and rang
at the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my
gloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when
she saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from
brown to green and yellow.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou?\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CYou? Good gracious! What do you want?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to London, Miss Pocket,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cand want to say good-bye to
Miss Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went
to ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned
and took me up, staring at me all the way.

Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread
table, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore, and
at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then just
abreast of the rotted bride-cake.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t go, Sarah,\xE2\x80\x9D she said. \xE2\x80\x9CWell, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,\xE2\x80\x9D I was exceedingly
careful what I said, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I thought you would kindly not mind my taking
leave of you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a gay figure, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, making her crutch stick play
round me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were
bestowing the finishing gift.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss
Havisham,\xE2\x80\x9D I murmured. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAy, ay!\xE2\x80\x9D said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with
delight. \xE2\x80\x9CI have seen Mr. Jaggers. I have heard about it, Pip. So you go
to-morrow?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Miss Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you are adopted by a rich person?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Miss Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot named?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Miss Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Miss Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

She quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her
enjoyment of Sarah Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s jealous dismay. \xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D she went on; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou
have a promising career before you. Be good--deserve it--and abide by
Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s instructions.\xE2\x80\x9D She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and
Sarah\xE2\x80\x99s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile. \xE2\x80\x9CGood-bye,
Pip!--you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Miss Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood-bye, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D

She stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to
my lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came
naturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket
with triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with
both her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly
lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.

Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen
out. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree
confounded. I said \xE2\x80\x9CGood-bye, Miss Pocket;\xE2\x80\x9D but she merely stared, and
did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the
house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s, took off my new
clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,
carrying it--to speak the truth--much more at my ease too, though I had
the bundle to carry.

And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had
run out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more
steadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled
away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more
appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I
dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my
splendor until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by
the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish with. We were
all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits.

I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little
hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all
alone. I am afraid--sore afraid--that this purpose originated in my
sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to
the coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing
of this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room
on this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and
had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me
in the morning. I did not.

All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places
instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now
pigs, now men,--never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied
me until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and
partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in
taking it fell asleep.

Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not
sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when
I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon.
But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the
teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go downstairs.
After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping
my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy
called to me that I was late.

It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,
saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,
\xE2\x80\x9CWell! I suppose I must be off!\xE2\x80\x9D and then I kissed my sister who was
laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed
Biddy, and threw my arms around Joe\xE2\x80\x99s neck. Then I took up my little
portmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I presently
heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old
shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped then, to
wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head,
crying huskily \xE2\x80\x9CHooroar!\xE2\x80\x9D and Biddy put her apron to her face.

I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had
supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to
have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High
Street. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very
peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to
show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all
beyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave
and sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the
village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CGood-bye, O my dear, dear
friend!\xE2\x80\x9D

Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain
upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was
better after I had cried than before,--more sorry, more aware of my own
ingratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe
with me then.

So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the
course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear
of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get
down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another evening at
home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made up my mind,
and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to
get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while I was occupied
with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe
in some man coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat
high.--As if he could possibly be there!

We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to
go back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and
the world lay spread before me.

This is the end of the first stage of Pip\xE2\x80\x99s expectations.

Chapter XX

The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five
hours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by
which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about
the Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.

We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable
to doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise,
while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have had
some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and
dirty.

Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and he
had written after it on his card, \xE2\x80\x9Cjust out of Smithfield, and close by
the coach-office.\xE2\x80\x9D Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have
as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed me
up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of
steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on his
box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained
pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time.
It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged
things behind for I don\xE2\x80\x99t know how many footmen to hold on by, and
a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the
temptation.

I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a
straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why
the horses\xE2\x80\x99 nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman
beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop
we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open
door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow much?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked the coachman.

The coachman answered, \xE2\x80\x9CA shilling--unless you wish to make it more.\xE2\x80\x9D

I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen it must be a shilling,\xE2\x80\x9D observed the coachman. \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t want to
get into trouble. I know him!\xE2\x80\x9D He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s
name, and shook his head.

When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the
ascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his
mind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my
hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is not,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the clerk. \xE2\x80\x9CHe is in Court at present. Am I
addressing Mr. Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn\xE2\x80\x99t say how
long he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time
being valuable, that he won\xE2\x80\x99t be longer than he can help.\xE2\x80\x9D

With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner
chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a
velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on
being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.

\xE2\x80\x9CGo and wait outside, Mike,\xE2\x80\x9D said the clerk.

I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk
shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,
and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.

Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal
place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the
distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to
peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers about, as I
should have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about, that
I should not have expected to see,--such as an old rusty pistol, a
sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and
two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy
about the nose. Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s own high-backed chair was of deadly black
horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I
fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and bit his forefinger at
the clients. The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had
a habit of backing up against the wall; the wall, especially opposite to
Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that
the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was
the innocent cause of his being turned out.

I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s
chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I
called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to
everybody else\xE2\x80\x99s disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many
other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have
the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what
was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came
there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s
family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such
ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the
blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.
Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may
have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit
that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr.
Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the
shelf above Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s chair, and got up and went out.

When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I
waited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into
Smithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all
asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me. So,
I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where
I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul\xE2\x80\x99s bulging at me from behind a
grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison. Following
the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden
the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and from the quantity of
people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred
that the trials were on.

While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk
minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a
trial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half a
crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in
his wig and robes,--mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and
presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I
declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as
to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also
where people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors\xE2\x80\x99
Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest
of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that \xE2\x80\x9Cfour on \xE2\x80\x98em\xE2\x80\x9D
 would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the
morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a
sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice\xE2\x80\x99s
proprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his
pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently
not belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had
bought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought
myself well rid of him for a shilling.

I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I
found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour
of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became
aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well
as I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew
Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the
pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when
they first passed me, that \xE2\x80\x9CJaggers would do it if it was to be done.\xE2\x80\x9D
 There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and
one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted
her by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, \xE2\x80\x9CJaggers
is for him, \xE2\x80\x98Melia, and what more could you have?\xE2\x80\x9D There was a red-eyed
little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in
company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand; and
while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a highly
excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and
accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, \xE2\x80\x9CO Jaggerth,
Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!\xE2\x80\x9D
 These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep
impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.

At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close
into Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards
me. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there
was quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder
and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed
himself to his followers.

First, he took the two secret men.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, I have nothing to say to you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his
finger at them. \xE2\x80\x9CI want to know no more than I know. As to the result,
it\xE2\x80\x99s a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you
paid Wemmick?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe made the money up this morning, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said one of the men,
submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s face.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it
up at all. Has Wemmick got it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said both the men together.

\xE2\x80\x9CVery well; then you may go. Now, I won\xE2\x80\x99t have it!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr Jaggers,
waving his hand at them to put them behind him. \xE2\x80\x9CIf you say a word to
me, I\xE2\x80\x99ll throw up the case.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe thought, Mr. Jaggers--\xE2\x80\x9D one of the men began, pulling off his hat.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s what I told you not to do,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CYou thought! I
think for you; that\xE2\x80\x99s enough for you. If I want you, I know where to
find you; I don\xE2\x80\x99t want you to find me. Now I won\xE2\x80\x99t have it. I won\xE2\x80\x99t hear
a word.\xE2\x80\x9D

The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind
again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd now you!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on
the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly
separated,--\xE2\x80\x9COh! Amelia, is it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Mr. Jaggers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do you remember,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat but for me you
wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be here and couldn\xE2\x80\x99t be here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO yes, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed both women together. \xE2\x80\x9CLord bless you, sir, well
we knows that!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen why,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cdo you come here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy Bill, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D the crying woman pleaded.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, I tell you what!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9COnce for all. If you don\xE2\x80\x99t
know that your Bill\xE2\x80\x99s in good hands, I know it. And if you come here
bothering about your Bill, I\xE2\x80\x99ll make an example of both your Bill and
you, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO yes, sir! Every farden.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another
word--one single word--and Wemmick shall give you your money back.\xE2\x80\x9D

This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.
No one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the
skirts of Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s coat to his lips several times.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know this man!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating
strain: \xE2\x80\x9CWhat does this fellow want?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMa thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho\xE2\x80\x99s he?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CLet go of my coat.\xE2\x80\x9D

The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing
it, replied, \xE2\x80\x9CHabraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re too late,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CI am over the way.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHoly father, Mithter Jaggerth!\xE2\x80\x9D cried my excitable acquaintance,
turning white, \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t thay you\xE2\x80\x99re again Habraham Latharuth!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cand there\xE2\x80\x99s an end of it. Get out of the
way.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen\xE2\x80\x99th gone to Mithter
Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter
Jaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you\xE2\x80\x99d have the condethenthun to
be bought off from the t\xE2\x80\x99other thide--at hany thuperior prithe!--money
no object!--Mithter Jaggerth--Mithter--!\xE2\x80\x9D

My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and
left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further
interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and
the man in velveteen with the fur cap.

\xE2\x80\x9CHere\xE2\x80\x99s Mike,\xE2\x80\x9D said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and
approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of
hair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling
at the bell-rope; \xE2\x80\x9Cyour man comes on this afternoon. Well?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Mas\xE2\x80\x99r Jaggers,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a
constitutional cold; \xE2\x80\x9Carter a deal o\xE2\x80\x99 trouble, I\xE2\x80\x99ve found one, sir, as
might do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is he prepared to swear?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Mas\xE2\x80\x99r Jaggers,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this
time; \xE2\x80\x9Cin a general way, anythink.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. \xE2\x80\x9CNow, I warned you before,\xE2\x80\x9D said
he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat if you ever
presumed to talk in that way here, I\xE2\x80\x99d make an example of you. You
infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?\xE2\x80\x9D

The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious
what he had done.

\xE2\x80\x9CSpooney!\xE2\x80\x9D said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his
elbow. \xE2\x80\x9CSoft Head! Need you say it face to face?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, I ask you, you blundering booby,\xE2\x80\x9D said my guardian, very sternly,
\xE2\x80\x9Conce more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is
prepared to swear?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson
from his face, and slowly replied, \xE2\x80\x9CAyther to character, or to having
been in his company and never left him all the night in question.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, be careful. In what station of life is this man?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the
ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before
beginning to reply in a nervous manner, \xE2\x80\x9CWe\xE2\x80\x99ve dressed him up like--\xE2\x80\x9D
 when my guardian blustered out,--

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat? You WILL, will you?\xE2\x80\x9D

(\xE2\x80\x9CSpooney!\xE2\x80\x9D added the clerk again, with another stir.)

After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:--

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is dressed like a \xE2\x80\x98spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he here?\xE2\x80\x9D asked my guardian.

\xE2\x80\x9CI left him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mike, \xE2\x80\x9Ca setting on some doorsteps round the corner.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTake him past that window, and let me see him.\xE2\x80\x9D

The window indicated was the office window. We all three went to
it, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an
accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short
suit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was not
by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery,
which was painted over.

\xE2\x80\x9CTell him to take his witness away directly,\xE2\x80\x9D said my guardian to the
clerk, in extreme disgust, \xE2\x80\x9Cand ask him what he means by bringing such a
fellow as that.\xE2\x80\x9D

My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,
standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed to
bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements he
had made for me. I was to go to \xE2\x80\x9CBarnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn,\xE2\x80\x9D to young Mr. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s
rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to
remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with
him to his father\xE2\x80\x99s house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it.
Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,--it was a very liberal
one,--and had handed to me from one of my guardian\xE2\x80\x99s drawers, the cards
of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,
and such other things as I could in reason want. \xE2\x80\x9CYou will find your
credit good, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt
like a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I shall by
this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you
outrunning the constable. Of course you\xE2\x80\x99ll go wrong somehow, but that\xE2\x80\x99s
no fault of mine.\xE2\x80\x9D

After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked
Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth while,
I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I
pleased.

I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk
was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I
accompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.
We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way
among them by saying coolly yet decisively, \xE2\x80\x9CI tell you it\xE2\x80\x99s no use; he
won\xE2\x80\x99t have a word to say to one of you;\xE2\x80\x9D and we soon got clear of them,
and went on side by side.




Chapter XXI

Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was
like in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in
stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been
imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some marks
in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and
the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints. The chisel
had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose,
but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off. I judged him
to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen, and he appeared
to have sustained a good many bereavements; for he wore at least four
mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping
willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings
and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were quite laden with
remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering eyes,--small, keen,
and black,--and thin wide mottled lips. He had had them, to the best of
my belief, from forty to fifty years.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo you were never in London before?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wemmick to me.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CI was new here once,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CRum to think of now!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are well acquainted with it now?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, yes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CI know the moves of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it a very wicked place?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked, more for the sake of saying
something than for information.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are
plenty of people anywhere, who\xE2\x80\x99ll do that for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf there is bad blood between you and them,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, to soften it off a
little.

\xE2\x80\x9CO! I don\xE2\x80\x99t know about bad blood,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Wemmick; \xE2\x80\x9Cthere\xE2\x80\x99s not
much bad blood about. They\xE2\x80\x99ll do it, if there\xE2\x80\x99s anything to be got by
it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat makes it worse.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou think so?\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CMuch about the same, I should
say.\xE2\x80\x9D

He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before him:
walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets
to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth
that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the top of
Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance,
and that he was not smiling at all.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked Mr. Wemmick.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, nodding in the direction. \xE2\x80\x9CAt Hammersmith, west of
London.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that far?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! Say five miles.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, you\xE2\x80\x99re a regular cross-examiner!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me
with an approving air. \xE2\x80\x9CYes, I know him. I know him!\xE2\x80\x9D

There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of
these words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways
at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,
when he said here we were at Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn. My depression was not
alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment
to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town
was a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied
spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby
buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for
Tom-cats.

We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an
introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me
like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in
it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most
dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen. I
thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were
divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled
flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while
To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new
wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were
being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants
and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy mourning of soot
and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn
ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere
dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all
the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,--rot of rat
and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides--addressed
themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, \xE2\x80\x9CTry Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s
Mixture.\xE2\x80\x9D

So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations,
that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, mistaking me;
\xE2\x80\x9Cthe retirement reminds you of the country. So it does me.\xE2\x80\x9D

He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,--which
appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of
those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find
themselves without the means of coming down,--to a set of chambers on
the top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was
a label on the letter-box, \xE2\x80\x9CReturn shortly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe hardly thought you\xE2\x80\x99d come so soon,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Wemmick explained. \xE2\x80\x9CYou
don\xE2\x80\x99t want me any more?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, thank you,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs I keep the cash,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Wemmick observed, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe shall most likely meet
pretty often. Good day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood day.\xE2\x80\x9D

I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he
thought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting
himself,--

\xE2\x80\x9CTo be sure! Yes. You\xE2\x80\x99re in the habit of shaking hands?\xE2\x80\x9D

I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,
but said yes.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have got so out of it!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wemmick,--\xE2\x80\x9Cexcept at last. Very
glad, I\xE2\x80\x99m sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!\xE2\x80\x9D

When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window
and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it
came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not
put my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view
of the Inn through the window\xE2\x80\x99s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully
looking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.

Mr. Pocket, Junior\xE2\x80\x99s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly
maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written
my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the
window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose
before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a
member of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under
each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of
breath.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Pocket?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear me!\xE2\x80\x9D he exclaimed. \xE2\x80\x9CI am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a
coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would
come by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,--not
that that is any excuse,--for I thought, coming from the country, you
might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden
Market to get it good.\xE2\x80\x9D

For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my
head. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think this
was a dream.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear me!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \xE2\x80\x9CThis door sticks so!\xE2\x80\x9D

As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while
the paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold
them. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with
the door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,
that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite
door, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start out
of my head, and as if this must be a dream.

\xE2\x80\x9CPray come in,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \xE2\x80\x9CAllow me to lead the way. I am
rather bare here, but I hope you\xE2\x80\x99ll be able to make out tolerably well
till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably through
to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk about
London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As to our
table, you won\xE2\x80\x99t find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our
coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your expense,
such being Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s directions. As to our lodging, it\xE2\x80\x99s not by
any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father
hasn\xE2\x80\x99t anything to give me, and I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be willing to take it, if he
had. This is our sitting-room,--just such chairs and tables and carpet
and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You mustn\xE2\x80\x99t give
me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come
for you from the coffee-house. This is my little bedroom; rather musty,
but Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s is musty. This is your bedroom; the furniture\xE2\x80\x99s hired for
the occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want
anything, I\xE2\x80\x99ll go and fetch it. The chambers are retired, and we shall
be alone together, but we shan\xE2\x80\x99t fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg
your pardon, you\xE2\x80\x99re holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take
these bags from you. I am quite ashamed.\xE2\x80\x9D

As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags, One,
Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to
be in mine, and he said, falling back,--

\xE2\x80\x9CLord bless me, you\xE2\x80\x99re the prowling boy!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Care the pale young gentleman!\xE2\x80\x9D




Chapter XXII

The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in
Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn, until we both burst out laughing. \xE2\x80\x9CThe idea of its
being you!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CThe idea of its being you!\xE2\x80\x9D said I. And then we
contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. \xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said the
pale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humoredly, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s all
over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you\xE2\x80\x99ll forgive me
for having knocked you about so.\xE2\x80\x9D

I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the
pale young gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s name) still rather confounded his intention with
his execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou hadn\xE2\x80\x99t come into your good fortune at that time?\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert
Pocket.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D he acquiesced: \xE2\x80\x9CI heard it had happened very lately. I was rather
on the lookout for good fortune then.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to
me. But she couldn\xE2\x80\x99t,--at all events, she didn\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x9D

I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.

\xE2\x80\x9CBad taste,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, laughing, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut a fact. Yes, she had sent for
me on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I
suppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been
what-you-may-called it to Estella.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s that?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked, with sudden gravity.

He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his
attention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.
\xE2\x80\x9CAffianced,\xE2\x80\x9D he explained, still busy with the fruit. \xE2\x80\x9CBetrothed.
Engaged. What\xE2\x80\x99s-his-named. Any word of that sort.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow did you bear your disappointment?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CPooh!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI didn\xE2\x80\x99t care much for it. She\xE2\x80\x99s a Tartar.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl\xE2\x80\x99s hard and
haughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by
Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat relation is she to Miss Havisham?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNone,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9COnly adopted.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLord, Mr. Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t you know?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear me! It\xE2\x80\x99s quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And
now let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come
there, that day?\xE2\x80\x9D

I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst
out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn\xE2\x80\x99t
ask him if he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly
established.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?\xE2\x80\x9D he went on.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know he is Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s man of business and solicitor, and has
her confidence when nobody else has?\xE2\x80\x9D

This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with
a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers
in Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s house on the very day of our combat, but never at any
other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever
seen me there.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he
called on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father
from his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s
cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he
is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.
I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since,
who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural
incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something
wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the
same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I
don\xE2\x80\x99t know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first
occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what
means.

He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor
about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did not seem
indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face, but it was
better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful. His figure
was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such
liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and
young. Whether Mr. Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s local work would have sat more gracefully on
him than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that he carried
off his rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit.

As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a
bad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,
and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.
I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a
country place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would
take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever
he saw me at a loss or going wrong.

\xE2\x80\x9CWith pleasure,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cthough I venture to prophesy that you\xE2\x80\x99ll want
very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like
to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me the favour
to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?\xE2\x80\x9D

I thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my
Christian name was Philip.

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t take to Philip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, smiling, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor it sounds like a moral
boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,
or so fat that he couldn\xE2\x80\x99t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that
he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a
bird\xE2\x80\x99s-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the
neighborhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and
you have been a blacksmith,---would you mind it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t mind anything that you propose,\xE2\x80\x9D I answered, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I don\xE2\x80\x99t
understand you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWould you mind Handel for a familiar name? There\xE2\x80\x99s a charming piece of
music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should like it very much.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, my dear Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, turning round as the door opened,
\xE2\x80\x9Chere is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table,
because the dinner is of your providing.\xE2\x80\x9D

This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a
nice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor\xE2\x80\x99s Feast,--and
it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent
circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.
This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the
banquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have
said, the lap of luxury,--being entirely furnished forth from the
coffee-house,--the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a
comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter
the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he
fell over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the
bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my
bed in the next room,--where I found much of its parsley and butter in
a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the
feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my
pleasure was without alloy.

We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his
promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.

\xE2\x80\x9CTrue,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic,
Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the
knife in the mouth,--for fear of accidents,--and that while the fork is
reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It is
scarcely worth mentioning, only it\xE2\x80\x99s as well to do as other people do.
Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This has
two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is the
object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on
the part of the right elbow.\xE2\x80\x9D

He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both
laughed and I scarcely blushed.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D he pursued, \xE2\x80\x9Cconcerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must
know, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her
father denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in
your part of the world, and was a brewer. I don\xE2\x80\x99t know why it should
be a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you
cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was
and brew. You see it every day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot on any account,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Herbert; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut a public-house may keep a
gentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his
daughter.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham was an only child?\xE2\x80\x9D I hazarded.

\xE2\x80\x9CStop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child;
she had a half-brother. Her father privately married again--his cook, I
rather think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought he was proud,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,
because he was proud, and in course of time she died. When she was dead,
I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then
the son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are
acquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,
extravagant, undutiful,--altogether bad. At last his father disinherited
him; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though
not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.--Take another glass of wine,
and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one
to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one\xE2\x80\x99s glass, as to turn it
bottom upwards with the rim on one\xE2\x80\x99s nose.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I
thanked him, and apologized. He said, \xE2\x80\x9CNot at all,\xE2\x80\x9D and resumed.

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after
as a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what
with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.
There were stronger differences between him and her than there had been
between him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a deep
and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father\xE2\x80\x99s anger.
Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,--merely breaking off, my
dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler.\xE2\x80\x9D

Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to
say. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a
much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it
within those limits. Again I thanked him and apologized, and again he
said in the cheerfullest manner, \xE2\x80\x9CNot at all, I am sure!\xE2\x80\x9D and resumed.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere appeared upon the scene--say at the races, or the public
balls, or anywhere else you like--a certain man, who made love to Miss
Havisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,
before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that
he was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he was
not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my
father most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his that
no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was, since the world
began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no varnish can hide the
grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the
grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely,
and professed to be devoted to her. I believe she had not shown much
susceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she possessed
certainly came out then, and she passionately loved him. There is no
doubt that she perfectly idolized him. He practised on her affection in
that systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he
induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery (which had
been weakly left him by his father) at an immense price, on the plea
that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all. Your
guardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s counsels, and she was
too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one. Her relations
were poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; he was poor
enough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only independent one among
them, he warned her that she was doing too much for this man, and
was placing herself too unreservedly in his power. She took the first
opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his
presence, and my father has never seen her since.\xE2\x80\x9D

I thought of her having said, \xE2\x80\x9CMatthew will come and see me at last when
I am laid dead upon that table;\xE2\x80\x9D and I asked Herbert whether his father
was so inveterate against her?

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s not that,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut she charged him, in the presence of her
intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon
her for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would
look true--even to him--and even to her. To return to the man and make
an end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were
bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were
invited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich she received,\xE2\x80\x9D I struck in, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen she was dressing for her
marriage? At twenty minutes to nine?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt the hour and minute,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, nodding, \xE2\x80\x9Cat which she
afterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that
it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can\xE2\x80\x99t tell you, because I
don\xE2\x80\x99t know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she
laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never since
looked upon the light of day.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that all the story?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked, after considering it.

\xE2\x80\x9CAll I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it
out for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss
Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was
absolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one
thing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced
confidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it
was a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wonder he didn\xE2\x80\x99t marry her and get all the property,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have
been a part of her half-brother\xE2\x80\x99s scheme,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert. \xE2\x80\x9CMind! I don\xE2\x80\x99t
know that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat became of the two men?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked, after again considering the
subject.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey fell into deeper shame and degradation--if there can be
deeper--and ruin.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre they alive now?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but
adopted. When adopted?\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert shrugged his shoulders. \xE2\x80\x9CThere has always been an Estella, since
I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now, Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D said
he, finally throwing off the story as it were, \xE2\x80\x9Cthere is a perfectly
open understanding between us. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you
know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd all that I know,\xE2\x80\x9D I retorted, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity
between you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your
advancement in life,--namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to
whom you owe it,--you may be very sure that it will never be encroached
upon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

In truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject
done with, even though I should be under his father\xE2\x80\x99s roof for years and
years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt
he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I
understood the fact myself.

It had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for
the purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the
lighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this
to be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the
course of conversation, what he was? He replied, \xE2\x80\x9CA capitalist,--an
Insurer of Ships.\xE2\x80\x9D I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search
of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, \xE2\x80\x9CIn the City.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in
the City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer
on his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible
head open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd
impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.

\xE2\x80\x9CI shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring
ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the
Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these
things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own
account. I think I shall trade,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, leaning back in his chair, \xE2\x80\x9Cto
the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious
woods. It\xE2\x80\x99s an interesting trade.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd the profits are large?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CTremendous!\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than
my own.

\xE2\x80\x9CI think I shall trade, also,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, putting his thumbs in his
waist-coat pockets, \xE2\x80\x9Cto the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.
Also to Ceylon, specially for elephants\xE2\x80\x99 tusks.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will want a good many ships,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CA perfect fleet,\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him
where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?

\xE2\x80\x9CI haven\xE2\x80\x99t begun insuring yet,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied. \xE2\x80\x9CI am looking about me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn. I said
(in a tone of conviction), \xE2\x80\x9CAh-h!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs a counting-house profitable?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo--do you mean to the young fellow who\xE2\x80\x99s in it?\xE2\x80\x9D he asked, in reply.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, n-no; not to me.\xE2\x80\x9D He said this with the air of one carefully
reckoning up and striking a balance. \xE2\x80\x9CNot directly profitable. That is,
it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t pay me anything, and I have to--keep myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as
if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative
capital from such a source of income.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut the thing is,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert Pocket, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you look about you.
That\xE2\x80\x99s the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you
look about you.\xE2\x80\x9D

It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn\xE2\x80\x99t be out of a
counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to
his experience.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen the time comes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen you see your opening. And you
go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there
you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do
but employ it.\xE2\x80\x9D

This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;
very like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded
to his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all
blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine
then. It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest
necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been
sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.

Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so
unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being
puffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,
and we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the
streets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to
church at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the
Parks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.

On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had
left Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them partook
of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That I could
have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very
last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities,
geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the London streets so
crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening,
there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor
old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps
of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn,
under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.

On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to
the counting-house to report himself,--to look about him, too, I
suppose,--and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or
two to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It
appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were
incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the
places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning. Nor
did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at
all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy
presence in all particulars, and with a look into another back second
floor, rather than a look out.

I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon \xE2\x80\x98Change, and I saw
fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to
be great merchants, though I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t understand why they should all be
out of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated
house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the
most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing,
even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives
and waiters\xE2\x80\x99 clothes, than in the steaks. This collation disposed of at
a moderate price (considering the grease, which was not charged for), we
went back to Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took
coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three o\xE2\x80\x99clock in
the afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s house.
Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden
overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s children were playing
about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or
prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs.
Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s children were not growing up or being brought up, but were
tumbling up.

Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with
her legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s two nurse-maids
were looking about them while the children played. \xE2\x80\x9CMamma,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is young Mr. Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me
with an appearance of amiable dignity.

\xE2\x80\x9CMaster Alick and Miss Jane,\xE2\x80\x9D cried one of the nurses to two of the
children, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you go a bouncing up against them bushes you\xE2\x80\x99ll fall over
into the river and be drownded, and what\xE2\x80\x99ll your pa say then?\xE2\x80\x9D

At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s handkerchief, and
said, \xE2\x80\x9CIf that don\xE2\x80\x99t make six times you\xE2\x80\x99ve dropped it, Mum!\xE2\x80\x9D Upon which
Mrs. Pocket laughed and said, \xE2\x80\x9CThank you, Flopson,\xE2\x80\x9D and settling herself
in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance immediately assumed
a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week,
but before she could have read half a dozen lines, she fixed her eyes
upon me, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CI hope your mamma is quite well?\xE2\x80\x9D This unexpected
inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the
absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she
would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and
would have sent her compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, \xE2\x80\x9Cif that don\xE2\x80\x99t
make seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!\xE2\x80\x9D Mrs.
Pocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable
surprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of
recognition, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CThank you, Flopson,\xE2\x80\x9D and forgot me, and went on
reading.

I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than
six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had
scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region
of air, wailing dolefully.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf there ain\xE2\x80\x99t Baby!\xE2\x80\x9D said Flopson, appearing to think it most
surprising. \xE2\x80\x9CMake haste up, Millers.\xE2\x80\x9D

Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees
the child\xE2\x80\x99s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young
ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all the
time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.

We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any
rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the
remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed
near Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and
tumbled over her,--always very much to her momentary astonishment, and
their own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for
this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to
speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,
which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.
Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby
and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.

\xE2\x80\x9CGracious me, Flopson!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a
moment, \xE2\x80\x9Ceverybody\xE2\x80\x99s tumbling!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGracious you, indeed, Mum!\xE2\x80\x9D returned Flopson, very red in the face;
\xE2\x80\x9Cwhat have you got there?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI got here, Flopson?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mrs. Pocket.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, if it ain\xE2\x80\x99t your footstool!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Flopson. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd if you keep it
under your skirts like that, who\xE2\x80\x99s to help tumbling? Here! Take the
baby, Mum, and give me your book.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a
little in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had
lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders
that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the
second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little
Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.

Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children
into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out
of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr.
Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and
with his very gray hair disordered on his head, as if he didn\xE2\x80\x99t quite
see his way to putting anything straight.




Chapter XXIII

Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to
see him. \xE2\x80\x9CFor, I really am not,\xE2\x80\x9D he added, with his son\xE2\x80\x99s smile,
\xE2\x80\x9Can alarming personage.\xE2\x80\x9D He was a young-looking man, in spite of
his perplexities and his very gray hair, and his manner seemed quite
natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;
there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would have
been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very
near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to Mrs.
Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which were
black and handsome, \xE2\x80\x9CBelinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D And she
looked up from her book, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D She then smiled upon me in an
absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower
water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone
or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like
her previous approaches, in general conversational condescension.

I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.
Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased
Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased
father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody\xE2\x80\x99s determined
opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,--I forget whose,
if I ever knew,--the Sovereign\xE2\x80\x99s, the Prime Minister\xE2\x80\x99s, the Lord
Chancellor\xE2\x80\x99s, the Archbishop of Canterbury\xE2\x80\x99s, anybody\xE2\x80\x99s,--and had
tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite
supposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for storming
the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate address
engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of
some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage either the
trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed Mrs. Pocket to
be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things
must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of
plebeian domestic knowledge.

So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady
by this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but
perfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,
in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was
also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount
to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing the
one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket had
taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it would
seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the knowledge of
the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or
withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them
after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was \xE2\x80\x9Ca
treasure for a Prince.\xE2\x80\x9D Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince\xE2\x80\x99s treasure
in the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought
him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the
object of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she had not married
a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving
reproach, because he had never got one.

Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a
pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for
my own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other
similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle
and Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of
architecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,
was reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of
exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.

Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody
else\xE2\x80\x99s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house
and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the
servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving
trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants
felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and
drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They allowed a very
liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that
by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been
the kitchen,--always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence, for,
before I had been there a week, a neighboring lady with whom the family
were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she had seen Millers
slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into
tears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing
that the neighbors couldn\xE2\x80\x99t mind their own business.

By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been
educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished himself;
but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very
early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling
of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,--of whom it was
remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to
help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had
left the Grindstone,--he had wearied of that poor work and had come to
London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he had \xE2\x80\x9Cread\xE2\x80\x9D
 with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had
refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned his
acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,
and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still
maintained the house I saw.

Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of that highly
sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,
and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances. This
lady\xE2\x80\x99s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking her down to
dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand on the
stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket
should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him.
That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and confidence
(at that time, I had known her something less than five minutes); if
they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut dear Mrs. Pocket,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Coiler, \xE2\x80\x9Cafter her early
disappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that), requires
so much luxury and elegance--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, ma\xE2\x80\x99am,\xE2\x80\x9D I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to
cry.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd she is of so aristocratic a disposition--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, ma\xE2\x80\x99am,\xE2\x80\x9D I said again, with the same object as before.

\xE2\x80\x9C--That it is hard,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Coiler, \xE2\x80\x9Cto have dear Mr. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s time
and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.\xE2\x80\x9D

I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher\xE2\x80\x99s time
and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,
and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company
manners.

It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and
Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and
other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian
name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy.
It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the
garden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which
her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at all.
Drummle didn\xE2\x80\x99t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a sulky
kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mrs. Pocket
as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady
neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it
appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last
a long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic
affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. To my
unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket
relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very
extraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and
with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He laid down the
carving-knife and fork,--being engaged in carving, at the moment,--put
his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make an
extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done this,
and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with what he
was about.

Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked
it for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the
pleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at
me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and
localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and
when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little to
her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for being on
the opposite side of the table.

After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring
comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,--a sagacious way of improving
their minds. There were four little girls, and two little boys, besides
the baby who might have been either, and the baby\xE2\x80\x99s next successor who
was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as
though those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere
for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs. Pocket looked at the
young Nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had
had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didn\xE2\x80\x99t quite know what
to make of them.

\xE2\x80\x9CHere! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,\xE2\x80\x9D said Flopson. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t
take it that way, or you\xE2\x80\x99ll get its head under the table.\xE2\x80\x9D

Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head
upon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious
concussion.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,\xE2\x80\x9D said Flopson; \xE2\x80\x9Cand Miss Jane, come
and dance to baby, do!\xE2\x80\x9D

One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely
taken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place
by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and
laughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the
meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,
and we all laughed and were glad.

Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,
then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s lap, and gave it the nut-crackers
to play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice
that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its
eyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the
two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with
a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost
half his buttons at the gaming-table.

I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s falling into a
discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a
sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the
baby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers. At
length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled, softly
left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous
weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time,
and not approving of this, said to Jane,--

\xE2\x80\x9CYou naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMamma dear,\xE2\x80\x9D lisped the little girl, \xE2\x80\x9Cbaby ood have put hith eyeth
out.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow dare you tell me so?\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Mrs. Pocket. \xE2\x80\x9CGo and sit down in
your chair this moment!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if
I myself had done something to rouse it.

\xE2\x80\x9CBelinda,\xE2\x80\x9D remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,
\xE2\x80\x9Chow can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the protection
of baby.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will not allow anybody to interfere,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Pocket. \xE2\x80\x9CI am
surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of
interference.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood God!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.
\xE2\x80\x9CAre infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save
them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will not be interfered with by Jane,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Pocket, with a
majestic glance at that innocent little offender. \xE2\x80\x9CI hope I know my poor
grandpapa\xE2\x80\x99s position. Jane, indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did
lift himself some inches out of his chair. \xE2\x80\x9CHear this!\xE2\x80\x9D he helplessly
exclaimed to the elements. \xE2\x80\x9CBabies are to be nut-crackered dead, for
people\xE2\x80\x99s poor grandpapa\xE2\x80\x99s positions!\xE2\x80\x9D Then he let himself down again,
and became silent.

We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A
pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a
series of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the
only member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had
any decided acquaintance.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Drummle,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Pocket, \xE2\x80\x9Cwill you ring for Flopson? Jane, you
undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with
ma!\xE2\x80\x9D

The baby was the soul of honor, and protested with all its might. It
doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s arm, exhibited a pair
of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft
face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it gained
its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few
minutes, being nursed by little Jane.

It happened that the other five children were left behind at the
dinner-table, through Flopson\xE2\x80\x99s having some private engagement, and
their not being anybody else\xE2\x80\x99s business. I thus became aware of the
mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in
the following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his face
heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if
he couldn\xE2\x80\x99t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that
establishment, and why they hadn\xE2\x80\x99t been billeted by Nature on
somebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain
questions,--as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,
Flopson was going to mend it when she had time,--and how little Fanny
came by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it
when she didn\xE2\x80\x99t forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and
gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as
they went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the
hair he dismissed the hopeless subject.

In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop had
each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I was
pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but as
I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,--not to say
for other waters,--I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition
of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to whom I
was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority confused me
very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he could have
known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt if he would
have paid it.

There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we
should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable
domestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid
came in, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CIf you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSpeak to your master?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused
again. \xE2\x80\x9CHow can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or
speak to me--at some other time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBegging your pardon, ma\xE2\x80\x99am,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the housemaid, \xE2\x80\x9CI should wish to
speak at once, and to speak to master.\xE2\x80\x9D

Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of
ourselves until he came back.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a pretty thing, Belinda!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pocket, returning with a
countenance expressive of grief and despair. \xE2\x80\x9CHere\xE2\x80\x99s the cook lying
insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh
butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!\xE2\x80\x9D

Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CThis is
that odious Sophia\xE2\x80\x99s doing!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean, Belinda?\xE2\x80\x9D demanded Mr. Pocket.

\xE2\x80\x9CSophia has told you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Pocket. \xE2\x80\x9CDid I not see her with my own
eyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask
to speak to you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Pocket,
\xE2\x80\x9Cand shown me the woman, and the bundle too?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do you defend her, Matthew,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs. Pocket, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor making
mischief?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.

\xE2\x80\x9CAm I, grandpapa\xE2\x80\x99s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mrs.
Pocket. \xE2\x80\x9CBesides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman,
and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the
situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.\xE2\x80\x9D

There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the
attitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with a
hollow voice, \xE2\x80\x9CGood night, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D when I deemed it advisable to go to
bed and leave him.




Chapter XXIV

After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and
had gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had ordered
all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together.
He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he referred
to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any
profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny
if I could \xE2\x80\x9Chold my own\xE2\x80\x9D with the average of young men in prosperous
circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.

He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of
such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the functions
of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that with
intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me, and
should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his way
of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself on
confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state
at once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his
compact with me, that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling
mine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no doubt
I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no such
excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever regard
him as having anything ludicrous about him--or anything but what was
serious, honest, and good--in his tutor communication with me.

When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had
begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my
bedroom in Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my
manners would be none the worse for Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s society. Mr. Pocket did
not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could
possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt
that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would
save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted
my wish to Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I could buy the furniture now hired for me,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cand one or two
other little things, I should be quite at home there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGo it!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. \xE2\x80\x9CI told you you\xE2\x80\x99d get on.
Well! How much do you want?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said I didn\xE2\x80\x99t know how much.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome!\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CHow much? Fifty pounds?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO, not nearly so much.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFive pounds?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, \xE2\x80\x9CO, more than
that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMore than that, eh!\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with
his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the wall
behind me; \xE2\x80\x9Chow much more?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is so difficult to fix a sum,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, hesitating.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CLet\xE2\x80\x99s get at it. Twice five; will that do?
Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said I thought that would do handsomely.

\xE2\x80\x9CFour times five will do handsomely, will it?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers,
knitting his brows. \xE2\x80\x9CNow, what do you make of four times five?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do I make of it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers; \xE2\x80\x9Chow much?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI suppose you make it twenty pounds,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, smiling.

\xE2\x80\x9CNever mind what I make it, my friend,\xE2\x80\x9D observed Mr. Jaggers, with a
knowing and contradictory toss of his head. \xE2\x80\x9CI want to know what you
make it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTwenty pounds, of course.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWemmick!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. \xE2\x80\x9CTake Mr. Pip\xE2\x80\x99s
written order, and pay him twenty pounds.\xE2\x80\x9D

This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked
impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never
laughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising
himself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows
joined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to
creak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened
to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick
that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s manner.

\xE2\x80\x9CTell him that, and he\xE2\x80\x99ll take it as a compliment,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Wemmick;
\xE2\x80\x9Che don\xE2\x80\x99t mean that you should know what to make of it.--Oh!\xE2\x80\x9D for
I looked surprised, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s not personal; it\xE2\x80\x99s professional: only
professional.\xE2\x80\x9D

Wemmick was at his desk, lunching--and crunching--on a dry hard biscuit;
pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as
if he were posting them.

\xE2\x80\x9CAlways seems to me,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cas if he had set a man-trap and was
watching it. Suddenly-click--you\xE2\x80\x99re caught!\xE2\x80\x9D

Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life, I
said I supposed he was very skilful?

\xE2\x80\x9CDeep,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cas Australia.\xE2\x80\x9D Pointing with his pen at the
office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes
of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.
\xE2\x80\x9CIf there was anything deeper,\xE2\x80\x9D added Wemmick, bringing his pen to
paper, \xE2\x80\x9Che\xE2\x80\x99d be it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,
\xE2\x80\x9CCa-pi-tal!\xE2\x80\x9D Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he
replied,--

\xE2\x80\x9CWe don\xE2\x80\x99t run much into clerks, because there\xE2\x80\x99s only one Jaggers, and
people won\xE2\x80\x99t have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would
you like to see \xE2\x80\x98em? You are one of us, as I may say.\xE2\x80\x9D

I accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the
post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key
of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his
coat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark
and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.
Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase
for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something
between a publican and a rat-catcher--a large pale, puffed, swollen
man--was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby
appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to
be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s coffers. \xE2\x80\x9CGetting evidence
together,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor the Bailey.\xE2\x80\x9D In the
room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair
(his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was
similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented
to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt
me anything I pleased,--and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,
as if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a
high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was
dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been
waxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of
the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s own use.

This was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick
led me into my guardian\xE2\x80\x99s room, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CThis you\xE2\x80\x99ve seen already.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPray,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them
caught my sight again, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhose likenesses are those?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThese?\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off
the horrible heads before bringing them down. \xE2\x80\x9CThese are two celebrated
ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap
(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the
inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered
his master, and, considering that he wasn\xE2\x80\x99t brought up to evidence,
didn\xE2\x80\x99t plan it badly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it like him?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat
upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.

\xE2\x80\x9CLike him? It\xE2\x80\x99s himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,
directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for
me, hadn\xE2\x80\x99t you, Old Artful?\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. He then explained this
affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady
and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,
\xE2\x80\x9CHad it made for me, express!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs the lady anybody?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9COnly his game. (You liked your bit of game,
didn\xE2\x80\x99t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except
one,--and she wasn\xE2\x80\x99t of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
have caught her looking after this urn, unless there was something to
drink in it.\xE2\x80\x9D Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s attention being thus directed to his brooch, he
put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his pocket-handkerchief.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid that other creature come to the same end?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked. \xE2\x80\x9CHe has the
same look.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re right,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick; \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s the genuine look. Much as if one
nostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes,
he came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you.
He forged wills, this blade did, if he didn\xE2\x80\x99t also put the supposed
testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though\xE2\x80\x9D (Mr.
Wemmick was again apostrophizing), \xE2\x80\x9Cand you said you could write Greek.
Yah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!\xE2\x80\x9D
 Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the
largest of his mourning rings and said, \xE2\x80\x9CSent out to buy it for me, only
the day before.\xE2\x80\x9D

While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,
the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived
from like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I
ventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood before
me, dusting his hands.

\xE2\x80\x9CO yes,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, \xE2\x80\x9Cthese are all gifts of that kind. One brings
another, you see; that\xE2\x80\x99s the way of it. I always take \xE2\x80\x98em. They\xE2\x80\x99re
curiosities. And they\xE2\x80\x99re property. They may not be worth much, but,
after all, they\xE2\x80\x99re property and portable. It don\xE2\x80\x99t signify to you with
your brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,
\xE2\x80\x98Get hold of portable property\xE2\x80\x99.\xE2\x80\x9D

When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a
friendly manner:--

\xE2\x80\x9CIf at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I
should consider it an honor. I have not much to show you; but such two
or three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I am
fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.\xE2\x80\x9D

I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.

\xE2\x80\x9CThankee,\xE2\x80\x9D said he; \xE2\x80\x9Cthen we\xE2\x80\x99ll consider that it\xE2\x80\x99s to come off, when
convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot yet.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Che\xE2\x80\x99ll give you wine, and good wine. I\xE2\x80\x99ll give you
punch, and not bad punch. And now I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you something. When you go
to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CShall I see something very uncommon?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou\xE2\x80\x99ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very
uncommon, you\xE2\x80\x99ll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness
of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won\xE2\x80\x99t lower your opinion of
Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s powers. Keep your eye on it.\xE2\x80\x9D

I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his
preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I
would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers \xE2\x80\x9Cat it?\xE2\x80\x9D

For several reasons, and not least because I didn\xE2\x80\x99t clearly know what
Mr. Jaggers would be found to be \xE2\x80\x9Cat,\xE2\x80\x9D I replied in the affirmative.
We dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where
a blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with the
fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably
chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or
cross-examination,--I don\xE2\x80\x99t know which,--and was striking her, and
the bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever
degree, said a word that he didn\xE2\x80\x99t approve of, he instantly required to
have it \xE2\x80\x9Ctaken down.\xE2\x80\x9D If anybody wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t make an admission, he said,
\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll have it out of you!\xE2\x80\x9D and if anybody made an admission, he said,
\xE2\x80\x9CNow I have got you!\xE2\x80\x9D The magistrates shivered under a single bite of
his finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his words,
and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction. Which
side he was on I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding
the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe,
he was not on the side of the bench; for, he was making the legs of the
old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his
denunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and
justice in that chair that day.




Chapter XXV

Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book
as if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an
acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement,
and comprehension,--in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in
the large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as
he himself lolled about in a room,--he was idle, proud, niggardly,
reserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,
who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the
discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley Drummle
had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman,
and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.

Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he
ought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and
admired her beyond measure. He had a woman\xE2\x80\x99s delicacy of feature,
and was--\xE2\x80\x9Cas you may see, though you never saw her,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert to
me--\xE2\x80\x9Cexactly like his mother.\xE2\x80\x9D It was but natural that I should take to
him much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest
evenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one
another, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up
in our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He
would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature,
even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and I always
think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water,
when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in
mid-stream.

Herbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with a
half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down
to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often
took me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all
hours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so
pleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of untried
youth and hope.

When I had been in Mr. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.
Camilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s sister. Georgiana, whom I
had seen at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s on the same occasion, also turned up. She
was a cousin,--an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity
religion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of
cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon
me in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as
a grown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the
complacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they
held in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily
disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon
themselves.

These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied
myself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began
to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have
thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books.
There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel
my deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast; and, with
one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and
clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as
Drummle if I had done less.

I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write
him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He
replied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect
me at the office at six o\xE2\x80\x99clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,
putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you think of walking down to Walworth?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

\xE2\x80\x9CCertainly,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you approve.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery much,\xE2\x80\x9D was Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s reply, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I have had my legs under the desk
all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you what I
have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,--which is
of home preparation,--and a cold roast fowl,--which is from the
cook\xE2\x80\x99s-shop. I think it\xE2\x80\x99s tender, because the master of the shop was a
Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.
I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, \xE2\x80\x9CPick us out
a good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box
another day or two, we could easily have done it.\xE2\x80\x9D He said to that,
\xE2\x80\x9CLet me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.\xE2\x80\x9D I let him, of
course. As far as it goes, it\xE2\x80\x99s property and portable. You don\xE2\x80\x99t object
to an aged parent, I hope?\xE2\x80\x9D

I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,
\xE2\x80\x9CBecause I have got an aged parent at my place.\xE2\x80\x9D I then said what
politeness required.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo, you haven\xE2\x80\x99t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?\xE2\x80\x9D he pursued, as we walked
along.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot yet.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect
you\xE2\x80\x99ll have an invitation to-morrow. He\xE2\x80\x99s going to ask your pals, too.
Three of \xE2\x80\x98em; ain\xE2\x80\x99t there?\xE2\x80\x9D

Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my
intimate associates, I answered, \xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, he\xE2\x80\x99s going to ask the whole gang,\xE2\x80\x9D--I hardly felt complimented by
the word,--\xE2\x80\x9Cand whatever he gives you, he\xE2\x80\x99ll give you good. Don\xE2\x80\x99t look
forward to variety, but you\xE2\x80\x99ll have excellence. And there\xE2\x80\x99s another rum
thing in his house,\xE2\x80\x9D proceeded Wemmick, after a moment\xE2\x80\x99s pause, as if
the remark followed on the housekeeper understood; \xE2\x80\x9Che never lets a door
or window be fastened at night.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he never robbed?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s it!\xE2\x80\x9D returned Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CHe says, and gives it out publicly, \xE2\x80\x9CI
want to see the man who\xE2\x80\x99ll rob me.\xE2\x80\x9D Lord bless you, I have heard him, a
hundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in our
front office, \xE2\x80\x9CYou know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there;
why don\xE2\x80\x99t you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can\xE2\x80\x99t I tempt you?\xE2\x80\x9D
 Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or
money.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey dread him so much?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CDread him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CI believe you they dread him. Not but what
he\xE2\x80\x99s artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia
metal, every spoon.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo they wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have much,\xE2\x80\x9D I observed, \xE2\x80\x9Ceven if they--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! But he would have much,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, cutting me short, \xE2\x80\x9Cand they
know it. He\xE2\x80\x99d have their lives, and the lives of scores of \xE2\x80\x98em. He\xE2\x80\x99d
have all he could get. And it\xE2\x80\x99s impossible to say what he couldn\xE2\x80\x99t get,
if he gave his mind to it.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was falling into meditation on my guardian\xE2\x80\x99s greatness, when Wemmick
remarked:--

\xE2\x80\x9CAs to the absence of plate, that\xE2\x80\x99s only his natural depth, you know.
A river\xE2\x80\x99s its natural depth, and he\xE2\x80\x99s his natural depth. Look at his
watch-chain. That\xE2\x80\x99s real enough.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s very massive,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CMassive?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CI think so. And his watch is a gold
repeater, and worth a hundred pound if it\xE2\x80\x99s worth a penny. Mr. Pip,
there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about
that watch; there\xE2\x80\x99s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who
wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it
was red hot, if inveigled into touching it.\xE2\x80\x9D

At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more
general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road,
until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of
Walworth.

It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little
gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.
Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of
garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted
with guns.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy own doing,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CLooks pretty; don\xE2\x80\x99t it?\xE2\x80\x9D

I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;
with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them sham),
and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s a real flagstaff, you see,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cand on Sundays I
run up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I
hoist it up--so--and cut off the communication.\xE2\x80\x9D

The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide
and two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he
hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and
not merely mechanically.

\xE2\x80\x9CAt nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock every night, Greenwich time,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe gun
fires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you\xE2\x80\x99ll
say he\xE2\x80\x99s a Stinger.\xE2\x80\x9D

The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,
constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an
ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, at the back,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cout of sight, so as not to impede
the idea of fortifications,--for it\xE2\x80\x99s a principle with me, if you have
an idea, carry it out and keep it up,--I don\xE2\x80\x99t know whether that\xE2\x80\x99s your
opinion--\xE2\x80\x9D

I said, decidedly.

\xE2\x80\x9C--At the back, there\xE2\x80\x99s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then,
I knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and
you\xE2\x80\x99ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you
can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a
time in point of provisions.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was
approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long
time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.
Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower
was raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which
might have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he had
constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going
and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it
made the back of your hand quite wet.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and
my own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, in
acknowledging my compliments. \xE2\x80\x9CWell; it\xE2\x80\x99s a good thing, you know. It
brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
mind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t put
you out?\xE2\x80\x9D

I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There
we found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,
cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell aged parent,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial
and jocose way, \xE2\x80\x9Chow am you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll right, John; all right!\xE2\x80\x9D replied the old man.

\xE2\x80\x9CHere\xE2\x80\x99s Mr. Pip, aged parent,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I wish you could hear
his name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that\xE2\x80\x99s what he likes. Nod away at
him, if you please, like winking!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a fine place of my son\xE2\x80\x99s, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D cried the old man, while I
nodded as hard as I possibly could. \xE2\x80\x9CThis is a pretty pleasure-ground,
sir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept
together by the Nation, after my son\xE2\x80\x99s time, for the people\xE2\x80\x99s
enjoyment.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re as proud of it as Punch; ain\xE2\x80\x99t you, Aged?\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick,
contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened; \xE2\x80\x9Cthere\xE2\x80\x99s
a nod for you;\xE2\x80\x9D giving him a tremendous one; \xE2\x80\x9Cthere\xE2\x80\x99s another for you;\xE2\x80\x9D
 giving him a still more tremendous one; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou like that, don\xE2\x80\x99t you? If
you\xE2\x80\x99re not tired, Mr. Pip--though I know it\xE2\x80\x99s tiring to strangers--will
you tip him one more? You can\xE2\x80\x99t think how it pleases him.\xE2\x80\x9D

I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him
bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in
the arbor; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had taken
him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of
perfection.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it your own, Mr. Wemmick?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO yes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9CI have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It\xE2\x80\x99s a
freehold, by George!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever seen it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CNever heard of it. Never seen the Aged.
Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is
another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and
when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it\xE2\x80\x99s not
in any way disagreeable to you, you\xE2\x80\x99ll oblige me by doing the same. I
don\xE2\x80\x99t wish it professionally spoken about.\xE2\x80\x9D

Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his
request. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and
talking, until it was almost nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock. \xE2\x80\x9CGetting near gun-fire,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s the Aged\xE2\x80\x99s treat.\xE2\x80\x9D

Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,
with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great
nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the
moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and
repair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the
Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a
cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in
it ring. Upon this, the Aged--who I believe would have been blown out
of his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows--cried out exultingly,
\xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s fired! I heerd him!\xE2\x80\x9D and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is
no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.

The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing
me his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious
character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been
committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several
manuscript confessions written under condemnation,--upon which Mr.
Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, \xE2\x80\x9Cevery one
of \xE2\x80\x98em Lies, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens
of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the
museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged. They were all
displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first
inducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room but
as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and
a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a
roasting-jack.

There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged in
the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to
give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper was
excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch
that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been
farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment. Nor was
there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such
a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down
on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my
forehead all night.

Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him
cleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from
my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in
a most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at
half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,
Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened
into a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business
and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as unconscious
of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the
arbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown
into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.




Chapter XXVI

It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early
opportunity of comparing my guardian\xE2\x80\x99s establishment with that of his
cashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with
his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he
called me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends
which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. \xE2\x80\x9CNo ceremony,\xE2\x80\x9D he stipulated,
\xE2\x80\x9Cand no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.\xE2\x80\x9D I asked him where we should
come to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his
general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,
\xE2\x80\x9CCome here, and I\xE2\x80\x99ll take you home with me.\xE2\x80\x9D I embrace this opportunity
of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or
a dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose, which
smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer\xE2\x80\x99s shop. It had an unusually
large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would wash his
hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he came
in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room. When I and
my friends repaired to him at six o\xE2\x80\x99clock next day, he seemed to have
been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for we found
him with his head butted into this closet, not only washing his hands,
but laving his face and gargling his throat. And even when he had
done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, he took out his
penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat
on.

There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into
the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was
something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled
his presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along
westward, he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of
the streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but
he never otherwise recognized anybody, or took notice that anybody
recognized him.

He conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side of
that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want
of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and opened the
door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used.
So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on
the first floor. There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and
as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I
thought they looked like.

Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his
dressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the whole
house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was comfortably
laid--no silver in the service, of course--and at the side of his chair
was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and decanters on
it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed throughout, that he
kept everything under his own hand, and distributed everything himself.

There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,
that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials,
acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very solid
and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however, and
there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a little
table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring the
office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an
evening and fall to work.

As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,--for he and I had
walked together,--he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,
and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to
be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.

\xE2\x80\x9CPip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to
the window, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know one from the other. Who\xE2\x80\x99s the Spider?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe spider?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s Bentley Drummle,\xE2\x80\x9D I replied; \xE2\x80\x9Cthe one with the delicate face is
Startop.\xE2\x80\x9D

Not making the least account of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe one with the delicate face,\xE2\x80\x9D he
returned, \xE2\x80\x9CBentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that
fellow.\xE2\x80\x9D

He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his
replying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw
discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came between
me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.

She was a woman of about forty, I supposed,--but I may have thought her
younger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely
pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot
say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be
parted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious expression
of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at
the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked to me as if
it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out
of the Witches\xE2\x80\x99 caldron.

She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a
finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats
at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,
while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the
housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice
mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all
the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our
host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the
table, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean
plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just
disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant
than the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw
in her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made
a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other
natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass
behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.

Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her
own striking appearance and by Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s preparation, I observed
that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my
guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put
before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and
wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I
fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and a
purpose of always holding her in suspense.

Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather
than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of
our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing my
tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Herbert, and to boast
of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips.
It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the
development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious
way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.

It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our
conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied
for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.
Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to
our company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that
as to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible agency,
my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this
trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular
it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous
manner.

Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,
taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,
was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and
showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.
Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper\xE2\x80\x99s, like a trap,
as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do
this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you talk of strength,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll show you a wrist.
Molly, let them see your wrist.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other
hand behind her waist. \xE2\x80\x9CMaster,\xE2\x80\x9D she said, in a low voice, with her eyes
attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll show you a wrist,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable
determination to show it. \xE2\x80\x9CMolly, let them see your wrist.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMaster,\xE2\x80\x9D she again murmured. \xE2\x80\x9CPlease!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMolly,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking
at the opposite side of the room, \xE2\x80\x9Clet them see both your wrists. Show
them. Come!\xE2\x80\x9D

He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She
brought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by
side. The last wrist was much disfigured,--deeply scarred and scarred
across and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from
Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us
in succession.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s power here,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews
with his forefinger. \xE2\x80\x9CVery few men have the power of wrist that this
woman has. It\xE2\x80\x99s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these
hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw
stronger in that respect, man\xE2\x80\x99s or woman\xE2\x80\x99s, than these.\xE2\x80\x9D

While he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued
to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment
he ceased, she looked at him again. \xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99ll do, Molly,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr.
Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou have been admired, and can
go.\xE2\x80\x9D She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,
putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and
passed round the wine.

\xE2\x80\x9CAt half-past nine, gentlemen,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe must break up. Pray make
the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I
drink to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,
it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose
depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,
until he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.
Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed
to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s wine.

In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,
and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some
boorish sneer of Drummle\xE2\x80\x99s, to the effect that we were too free with our
money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it
came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my
presence but a week or so before.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Drummle; \xE2\x80\x9Che\xE2\x80\x99ll be paid.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t mean to imply that he won\xE2\x80\x99t,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it might make you
hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou should think!\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Drummle. \xE2\x80\x9COh Lord!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI dare say,\xE2\x80\x9D I went on, meaning to be very severe, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
lend money to any of us if we wanted it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are right,\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle. \xE2\x80\x9CI wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t lend one of you a sixpence. I
wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t lend anybody a sixpence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou should say,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Drummle. \xE2\x80\x9COh Lord!\xE2\x80\x9D

This was so very aggravating--the more especially as I found myself
making no way against his surly obtuseness--that I said, disregarding
Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s efforts to check me,--

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you what
passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,\xE2\x80\x9D
 growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might
both go to the devil and shake ourselves.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you, however,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether you want to know or not. We
said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed
to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands
in his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that
it was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.

Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than
I had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,
being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact
opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct
personal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop
tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made
us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle,
without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his pockets,
dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would
have flung it at his adversary\xE2\x80\x99s head, but for our entertainer\xE2\x80\x99s
dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that
purpose.

\xE2\x80\x9CGentlemen,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and
hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, \xE2\x80\x9CI am exceedingly
sorry to announce that it\xE2\x80\x99s half past nine.\xE2\x80\x9D

On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,
Startop was cheerily calling Drummle \xE2\x80\x9Cold boy,\xE2\x80\x9D as if nothing had
happened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not
even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,
who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;
Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses,
much as he was wont to follow in his boat.

As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for
a moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found
him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard
at it, washing his hands of us.

I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything
disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame
me much.

\xE2\x80\x9CPooh!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the
water-drops; \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.\xE2\x80\x9D

He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing, and
towelling himself.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am glad you like him, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said I--\xE2\x80\x9Cbut I don\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no,\xE2\x80\x9D my guardian assented; \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t have too much to do with him.
Keep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one
of the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller--\xE2\x80\x9D

Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I am not a fortune-teller,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, letting his head drop into a
festoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. \xE2\x80\x9CYou know what I
am, don\xE2\x80\x99t you? Good night, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood night, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

In about a month after that, the Spider\xE2\x80\x99s time with Mr. Pocket was up
for good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he
went home to the family hole.




Chapter XXVII


\xE2\x80\x9CMY DEAR MR PIP:--

\xE2\x80\x9CI write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he
is going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if
agreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Hotel
Tuesday morning at nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock, when if not agreeable please leave
word. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of you
in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing. If
now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the love of
poor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from your ever obliged, and
affectionate servant,

\xE2\x80\x9CBIDDY.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CP.S. He wishes me most particular to write what larks. He says you will
understand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him,
even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is a
worthy, worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the last little
sentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks.\xE2\x80\x9D

I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its
appointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings
I looked forward to Joe\xE2\x80\x99s coming.

Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no;
with considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of
incongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly
would have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming
to Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall
in Bentley Drummle\xE2\x80\x99s way. I had little objection to his being seen by
Herbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the
sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in
contempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are
usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.

I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite
unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those
wrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were
vastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honor
of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring
upholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a boy
in boots,--top boots,--in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been
said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of the
refuse of my washerwoman\xE2\x80\x99s family), and had clothed him with a blue
coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots
already mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal
to eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my
existence.

This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday
morning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for
floorcloth,) and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he
thought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being
so interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of
suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see him, he wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
have been quite so brisk about it.

However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and
I got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and
breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately
the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact
that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak
giant of a Sweep.

As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger
pursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on
the staircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming upstairs,
--his state boots being always too big for him,--and by the time
it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of
his ascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his
finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards
distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a
faint single rap, and Pepper--such was the compromising name of the
avenging boy--announced \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Gargery!\xE2\x80\x9D I thought he never would have
done wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the
mat, but at last he came in.

\xE2\x80\x9CJoe, how are you, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPip, how AIR you, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

With his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put
down on the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them
straight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.\xE2\x80\x9D

But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird\xE2\x80\x99s-nest with
eggs in it, wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t hear of parting with that piece of property, and
persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich you have that growed,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cand that swelled, and that
gentle-folked;\xE2\x80\x9D Joe considered a little before he discovered this word;
\xE2\x80\x9Cas to be sure you are a honor to your king and country.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you, Joe, look wonderfully well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank God,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m ekerval to most. And your sister, she\xE2\x80\x99s
no worse than she were. And Biddy, she\xE2\x80\x99s ever right and ready. And all
friends is no backerder, if not no forarder. \xE2\x80\x98Ceptin Wopsle; he\xE2\x80\x99s had a
drop.\xE2\x80\x9D

All this time (still with both hands taking great care of the
bird\xE2\x80\x99s-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and
round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.

\xE2\x80\x9CHad a drop, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy yes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, lowering his voice, \xE2\x80\x9Che\xE2\x80\x99s left the Church and went
into the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him
to London along with me. And his wish were,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, getting the
bird\xE2\x80\x99s-nest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an
egg with his right; \xE2\x80\x9Cif no offence, as I would \xE2\x80\x98and you that.\xE2\x80\x9D

I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of
a small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that
very week, of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,
whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard
has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWere you at his performance, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D I inquired.

\xE2\x80\x9CI were,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.

\xE2\x80\x9CWas there a great sensation?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cyes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.
Partickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,
whether it were calc\xE2\x80\x99lated to keep a man up to his work with a good
hart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with
\xE2\x80\x9CAmen!\xE2\x80\x9D A man may have had a misfortun\xE2\x80\x99 and been in the Church,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Joe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut
that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I
meantersay, if the ghost of a man\xE2\x80\x99s own father cannot be allowed to
claim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning \xE2\x80\x98at
is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers
brings it off, try to keep it on how you may.\xE2\x80\x9D

A ghost-seeing effect in Joe\xE2\x80\x99s own countenance informed me that Herbert
had entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his
hand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird\xE2\x80\x99s-nest.

\xE2\x80\x9CYour servant, Sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhich I hope as you and Pip\xE2\x80\x9D--here his
eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so
plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the
family, that I frowned it down and confused him more--\xE2\x80\x9CI meantersay, you
two gentlemen,--which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?
For the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Joe, confidentially, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I believe its character do stand it; but I
wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t keep a pig in it myself,--not in the case that I wished him to
fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our
dwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me
\xE2\x80\x9Csir,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the
room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,--as if it were
only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a
resting place,--and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the
chimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Herbert, who always
presided of a morning.

\xE2\x80\x9CThankee, Sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, stiff from head to foot, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll take whichever
is most agreeable to yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you say to coffee?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThankee, Sir,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,
\xE2\x80\x9Csince you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy
to your own opinions. But don\xE2\x80\x99t you never find it a little \xE2\x80\x98eating?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSay tea then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, pouring it out.

Here Joe\xE2\x80\x99s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his
chair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it
were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again
soon.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWere it yesterday afternoon?\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, after coughing behind his hand,
as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came. \xE2\x80\x9CNo
it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon\xE2\x80\x9D (with an
appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you seen anything of London yet?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, yes, Sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cme and Wopsle went off straight to look at
the Blacking Ware\xE2\x80\x99us. But we didn\xE2\x80\x99t find that it come up to its likeness
in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,\xE2\x80\x9D added Joe, in
an explanatory manner, \xE2\x80\x9Cas it is there drawd too architectooralooral.\xE2\x80\x9D

I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily expressive
to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect Chorus, but
for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat, which
was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant attention, and a
quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by wicket-keeping.
He made extraordinary play with it, and showed the greatest skill; now,
rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped; now, merely stopping
it midway, beating it up, and humoring it in various parts of the room
and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall,
before he felt it safe to close with it; finally splashing it into the
slop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.

As to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to
reflect upon,--insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself
to that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why
should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for
his holiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of
meditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had
his eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such
remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much
more than he ate, and pretended that he hadn\xE2\x80\x99t dropped it; that I was
heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.

I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was
all my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have
been easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him;
in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.

\xE2\x80\x9CUs two being now alone, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D--began Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CJoe,\xE2\x80\x9D I interrupted, pettishly, \xE2\x80\x9Chow can you call me, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like
reproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars
were, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.

\xE2\x80\x9CUs two being now alone,\xE2\x80\x9D resumed Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cand me having the intentions and
abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now conclude--leastways
begin--to mention what have led to my having had the present honor. For
was it not,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, with his old air of lucid exposition, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat my
only wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honor of
breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance
against this tone.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is how it were. I were at the Bargemen
t\xE2\x80\x99other night, Pip;\xE2\x80\x9D--whenever he subsided into affection, he called me
Pip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen
there come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that same identical,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Joe, going down a new track, \xE2\x80\x9Cdo comb my \xE2\x80\x98air the wrong way
sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were him which
ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow
by yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNonsense. It was you, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich I fully believed it were, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, slightly tossing
his head, \xE2\x80\x9Cthough it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip; this same
identical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at
the Bargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the
workingman, sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were, \xE2\x80\x98Joseph,
Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98She wish,\xE2\x80\x99 were Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s word, \xE2\x80\x98to speak to you.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D Joe sat and
rolled his eyes at the ceiling.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Joe? Go on, please.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNext day, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,
\xE2\x80\x9Chaving cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich I say, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if
he were making his will, \xE2\x80\x9CMiss A., or otherways Havisham. Her expression
air then as follering: \xE2\x80\x98Mr. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mr.
Pip?\xE2\x80\x99 Having had a letter from you, I were able to say \xE2\x80\x98I am.\xE2\x80\x99 (When
I married your sister, sir, I said \xE2\x80\x98I will;\xE2\x80\x99 and when I answered your
friend, Pip, I said \xE2\x80\x98I am.\xE2\x80\x99) \xE2\x80\x98Would you tell him, then,\xE2\x80\x99 said she, \xE2\x80\x98that
which Estella has come home and would be glad to see him.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause
of its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his
errand, I should have given him more encouragement.

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen I got home and asked her fur to write the
message to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, \xE2\x80\x98I know he will be very
glad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see
him, go!\xE2\x80\x99 I have now concluded, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, rising from his chair,
\xE2\x80\x9Cand, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a
greater height.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you are not going now, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes I am,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you are coming back to dinner, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo I am not,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe.

Our eyes met, and all the \xE2\x80\x9CSir\xE2\x80\x9D melted out of that manly heart as he gave
me his hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CPip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded
together, as I may say, and one man\xE2\x80\x99s a blacksmith, and one\xE2\x80\x99s a
whitesmith, and one\xE2\x80\x99s a goldsmith, and one\xE2\x80\x99s a coppersmith. Diwisions
among such must come, and must be met as they come. If there\xE2\x80\x99s been
any fault at all to-day, it\xE2\x80\x99s mine. You and me is not two figures to
be together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and
beknown, and understood among friends. It ain\xE2\x80\x99t that I am proud, but
that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these
clothes. I\xE2\x80\x99m wrong in these clothes. I\xE2\x80\x99m wrong out of the forge, the
kitchen, or off th\xE2\x80\x99 meshes. You won\xE2\x80\x99t find half so much fault in me if
you think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even
my pipe. You won\xE2\x80\x99t find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you
should ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge
window and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old
burnt apron, sticking to the old work. I\xE2\x80\x99m awful dull, but I hope I\xE2\x80\x99ve
beat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless
you, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!\xE2\x80\x9D

I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity
in him. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he
spoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touched me
gently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover
myself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in the
neighboring streets; but he was gone.




Chapter XXVIII

It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first
flow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe\xE2\x80\x99s.
But, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow\xE2\x80\x99s coach, and had been
down to Mr. Pocket\xE2\x80\x99s and back, I was not by any means convinced on the
last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting
up at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe\xE2\x80\x99s; I was not
expected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from
Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, and she was exacting and mightn\xE2\x80\x99t like it. All other
swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such
pretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should
innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else\xE2\x80\x99s manufacture is
reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin
of my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of
compactly folding up my bank-notes for security\xE2\x80\x99s sake, abstracts the
notes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine,
when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!

Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much
disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was
tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots
in the archway of the Blue Boar\xE2\x80\x99s posting-yard; it was almost solemn to
imagine him casually produced in the tailor\xE2\x80\x99s shop, and confounding
the disrespectful senses of Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy. On the other hand, Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy
might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless
and desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High
Street. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On the
whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.

It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter
had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or
three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was
two o\xE2\x80\x99clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare,
attended by the Avenger,--if I may connect that expression with one who
never attended on me if he could possibly help it.

At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards
by stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside
passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling
their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised
when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two
convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old reason
now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word \xE2\x80\x9Cconvict.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou don\xE2\x80\x99t mind them, Handel?\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert.

\xE2\x80\x9CO no!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought you seemed as if you didn\xE2\x80\x99t like them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don\xE2\x80\x99t
particularly. But I don\xE2\x80\x99t mind them.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSee! There they are,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Ccoming out of the Tap. What a
degraded and vile sight it is!\xE2\x80\x9D

They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler
with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.
The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their
legs,--irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I
likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried
a thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good
understanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at
the putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were
an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he the
Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared
as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the world,
both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of
clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes,
and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his half-closed eye
at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the
Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down
with his invisible gun!

It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had
never seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye appraised
my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said something to the
other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink
of their coupling manacle, and looked at something else. The great
numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy
ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed
legs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way
in which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them (as
Herbert had said) a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.

But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the back
of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that
there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front
behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the
fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said
that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous
company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and infamous, and
shameful, and I don\xE2\x80\x99t know what else. At this time the coach was ready
and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and
the prisoners had come over with their keeper,--bringing with them that
curious flavor of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone,
which attends the convict presence.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t take it so much amiss, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D pleaded the keeper to the angry
passenger; \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll sit next you myself. I\xE2\x80\x99ll put \xE2\x80\x98em on the outside of
the row. They won\xE2\x80\x99t interfere with you, sir. You needn\xE2\x80\x99t know they\xE2\x80\x99re
there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd don\xE2\x80\x99t blame me,\xE2\x80\x9D growled the convict I had recognized. \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t
want to go. I am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am concerned
any one\xE2\x80\x99s welcome to my place.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COr mine,\xE2\x80\x9D said the other, gruffly. \xE2\x80\x9CI wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have incommoded none
of you, if I\xE2\x80\x99d had my way.\xE2\x80\x9D Then they both laughed, and began cracking
nuts, and spitting the shells about.--As I really think I should have
liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised.

At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,
and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So he
got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the
place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they
could, and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on
the hair of my head.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood-bye, Handel!\xE2\x80\x9D Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a
blessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.

It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict\xE2\x80\x99s
breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The
sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and
searching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more
breathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in
doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side, in
my shrinking endeavors to fend him off.

The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us
all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way
House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed
off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a
couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,
and how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I
were going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the
question up again.

But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although
I could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and
shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that
blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against
the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first
words I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of
my own thought, \xE2\x80\x9CTwo One Pound notes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow did he get \xE2\x80\x98em?\xE2\x80\x9D said the convict I had never seen.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow should I know?\xE2\x80\x9D returned the other. \xE2\x80\x9CHe had \xE2\x80\x98em stowed away
somehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish,\xE2\x80\x9D said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I had
\xE2\x80\x98em here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo one pound notes, or friends?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo one pound notes. I\xE2\x80\x99d sell all the friends I ever had for one, and
think it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says--?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo he says,\xE2\x80\x9D resumed the convict I had recognized,--\xE2\x80\x9Cit was all
said and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the
Dock-yard,--\xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99re a going to be discharged?\xE2\x80\x99 Yes, I was. Would I find
out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two
one pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMore fool you,\xE2\x80\x9D growled the other. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99d have spent \xE2\x80\x98em on a Man, in
wittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed
nothing of you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot a ha\xE2\x80\x99porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried again
for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd was that--Honor!--the only time you worked out, in this part of the
country?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe only time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat might have been your opinion of the place?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,
mist, and mudbank.\xE2\x80\x9D

They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually
growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.

After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and
been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling
certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not
only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and
so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could
have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our
being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a
dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in his
hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as
we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This device I
executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot under my
feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down before
me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first
stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their way
with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to
the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for
them at the slime-washed stairs,--again heard the gruff \xE2\x80\x9CGive way, you!\xE2\x80\x9D
 like and order to dogs,--again saw the wicked Noah\xE2\x80\x99s Ark lying out on
the black water.

I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether
undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on to
the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of
a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am confident
that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a
few minutes of the terror of childhood.

The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered
my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As
soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory, he asked me
if he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Ccertainly not.\xE2\x80\x9D

The waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the
Commercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and
took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local
newspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this
paragraph:--

Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to
the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this
neighborhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet
not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!)
that the youth\xE2\x80\x99s earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly
respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed
trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises
are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is not wholly
irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor
of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced
the founder of the latter\xE2\x80\x99s fortunes. Does the thought-contracted brow
of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose
fortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp.
VERB. SAP.

I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the
days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met
somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have
told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my
fortunes.




Chapter XXIX

Betimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to
Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s
side of town,--which was not Joe\xE2\x80\x99s side; I could go there
to-morrow,--thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures
of her plans for me.

She had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could not
fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for me to
restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms,
set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down the
cobwebs, destroy the vermin,--in short, do all the shining deeds of the
young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to
look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked
windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with
its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich
attractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the inspiration
of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had taken such
strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon
her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had been
all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her with any
attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this place, of a
fixed purpose, because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into
my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the conventional notion
of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified truth is, that when I
loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found
her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often,
if not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against
peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that
could be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it,
and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly
believed her to be human perfection.

I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When
I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the
gate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart
moderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the
courtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its
rusty hinges.

Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started
much more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober
gray dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of
porter at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s door.

\xE2\x80\x9COrlick!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh, young master, there\xE2\x80\x99s more changes than yours. But come in, come
in. It\xE2\x80\x99s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.\xE2\x80\x9D

I entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. \xE2\x80\x9CYes!\xE2\x80\x9D
 said he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards
the house. \xE2\x80\x9CHere I am!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow did you come here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI come her,\xE2\x80\x9D he retorted, \xE2\x80\x9Con my legs. I had my box brought alongside
me in a barrow.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you here for good?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI ain\xE2\x80\x99t here for harm, young master, I suppose?\xE2\x80\x9D

I was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my
mind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my
legs and arms, to my face.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen you have left the forge?\xE2\x80\x9D I said.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo this look like a forge?\xE2\x80\x9D replied Orlick, sending his glance all
round him with an air of injury. \xE2\x80\x9CNow, do it look like it?\xE2\x80\x9D

I asked him how long he had left Gargery\xE2\x80\x99s forge?

\xE2\x80\x9COne day is so like another here,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I don\xE2\x80\x99t know
without casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI could have told you that, Orlick.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, dryly. \xE2\x80\x9CBut then you\xE2\x80\x99ve got to be a scholar.\xE2\x80\x9D

By this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one
just within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the
courtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place
usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were hanging on
the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his patchwork-covered
bed was in a little inner division or recess. The whole had a slovenly,
confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a human dormouse; while he,
looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window, looked
like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up,--as indeed he was.

\xE2\x80\x9CI never saw this room before,\xE2\x80\x9D I remarked; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut there used to be no
Porter here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said he; \xE2\x80\x9Cnot till it got about that there was no protection on
the premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and
Tag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended to
the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought, and
I took it. It\xE2\x80\x99s easier than bellowsing and hammering.--That\xE2\x80\x99s loaded,
that is.\xE2\x80\x9D

My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the
chimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, not desirous of more conversation, \xE2\x80\x9Cshall I go up to
Miss Havisham?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBurn me, if I know!\xE2\x80\x9D he retorted, first stretching himself and then
shaking himself; \xE2\x80\x9Cmy orders ends here, young master. I give this here
bell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till
you meet somebody.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am expected, I believe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBurn me twice over, if I can say!\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in
my thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,
while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who
appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason
of me.

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said she. \xE2\x80\x9CYou, is it, Mr. Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family
are all well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre they any wiser?\xE2\x80\x9D said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head; \xE2\x80\x9Cthey
had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know your way,
sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I
ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old
way at the door of Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s room. \xE2\x80\x9CPip\xE2\x80\x99s rap,\xE2\x80\x9D I heard her say,
immediately; \xE2\x80\x9Ccome in, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

She was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two
hands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on
the fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been
worn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an elegant
lady whom I had never seen.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome in, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round
or up; \xE2\x80\x9Ccome in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as if I
were a queen, eh?--Well?\xE2\x80\x9D

She looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a
grimly playful manner,--

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI heard, Miss Havisham,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, rather at a loss, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you were so
kind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D

The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked
archly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella\xE2\x80\x99s eyes. But she
was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,
in all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance,
that I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that
I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O
the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the
inaccessibility that came about her!

She gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in
seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a long,
long time.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you find her much changed, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Miss Havisham, with her
greedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between
them, as a sign to me to sit down there.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella
in the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the
old--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat? You are not going to say into the old Estella?\xE2\x80\x9D Miss Havisham
interrupted. \xE2\x80\x9CShe was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away
from her. Don\xE2\x80\x99t you remember?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better
then, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she
had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very
disagreeable.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he changed?\xE2\x80\x9D Miss Havisham asked her.

\xE2\x80\x9CVery much,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, looking at me.

\xE2\x80\x9CLess coarse and common?\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella\xE2\x80\x99s
hair.

Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,
and looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,
but she lured me on.

We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had
so wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from
France, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,
she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that
it was impossible and out of nature--or I thought so--to separate them
from her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence
from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had
disturbed my boyhood,--from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had
first made me ashamed of home and Joe,--from all those visions that had
raised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the
anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden
window of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me
to separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life
of my life.

It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and
return to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had
conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the
neglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel
her about a little, as in times of yore.

So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I
had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;
I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,
quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As we
drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,--

\xE2\x80\x9CI must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight
that day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou rewarded me very much.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid I?\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. \xE2\x80\x9CI remember I
entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill
that he should be brought here to pester me with his company.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe and I are great friends now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish
look, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.

\xE2\x80\x9CSince your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your
companions,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella.

\xE2\x80\x9CNaturally,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd necessarily,\xE2\x80\x9D she added, in a haughty tone; \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat was fit company
for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.\xE2\x80\x9D

In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering
intention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put
it to flight.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?\xE2\x80\x9D said
Estella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting
times.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot the least.\xE2\x80\x9D

The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my
side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at
hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me
more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being
so set apart for her and assigned to her.

The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and
after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again
into the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her
walking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and
careless look in that direction, \xE2\x80\x9CDid I?\xE2\x80\x9D I reminded her where she had
come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, \xE2\x80\x9CI
don\xE2\x80\x99t remember.\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CNot remember that you made me cry?\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said
she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe that
her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again,
inwardly,--and that is the sharpest crying of all.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou must know,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and
beautiful woman might, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I have no heart,--if that has anything to
do with my memory.\xE2\x80\x9D

I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of
doubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty
without it.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Estella, \xE2\x80\x9Cand of course if it ceased to beat I should cease
to be. But you know what I mean. I have no softness there,
no--sympathy--sentiment--nonsense.\xE2\x80\x9D

What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and
looked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham? No.
In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance
to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by
children, from grown person with whom they have been much associated and
secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will produce a remarkable
occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite
different. And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham. I looked
again, and though she was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.

What was it?

\xE2\x80\x9CI am serious,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow was
smooth) as with a darkening of her face; \xE2\x80\x9Cif we are to be thrown much
together, you had better believe it at once. No!\xE2\x80\x9D imperiously stopping
me as I opened my lips. \xE2\x80\x9CI have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere. I
have never had any such thing.\xE2\x80\x9D

In another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she
pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same
first day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to have
seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand, again
the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me. My
involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm. Instantly
the ghost passed once more and was gone.

What was it?

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Estella. \xE2\x80\x9CAre you scared again?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should be, if I believed what you said just now,\xE2\x80\x9D I replied, to turn
it off.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen you don\xE2\x80\x99t? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will
soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be
laid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round
of the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my
cruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand
now, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We
walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in
bloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of
the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could
not have been more cherished in my remembrance.

There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;
we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more
in her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her
beauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my delight,
and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen
us for one another. Wretched boy!

At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,
that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and
would come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in
the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we
were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.

It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began
the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But,
in the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the
chair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and beautiful
than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.

The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,
and Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre
of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms
stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow
cloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the
door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity
that was of its kind quite dreadful.

Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and
said in a whisper,--

\xE2\x80\x9CIs she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEverybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

She drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as
she sat in the chair. \xE2\x80\x9CLove her, love her, love her! How does she use
you?\xE2\x80\x9D

Before I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question
at all) she repeated, \xE2\x80\x9CLove her, love her, love her! If she favors
you, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to
pieces,--and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,--love
her, love her, love her!\xE2\x80\x9D

Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her
utterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round
my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.

\xE2\x80\x9CHear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,
to be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.
Love her!\xE2\x80\x9D

She said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she
meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of
love--despair--revenge--dire death--it could not have sounded from her
lips more like a curse.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat
real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation,
utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the
whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter--as I
did!\xE2\x80\x9D

When she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught
her round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a
dress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself
against the wall and fallen dead.

All this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I
was conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in
the room.

He always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a
pocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was
of great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a
client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief
as if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing,
as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client
or witness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed
directly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he had
this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking at
us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause
in that attitude, \xE2\x80\x9CIndeed? Singular!\xE2\x80\x9D and then put the handkerchief to
its right use with wonderful effect.

Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody
else) afraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and
stammered that he was as punctual as ever.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs punctual as ever,\xE2\x80\x9D he repeated, coming up to us. \xE2\x80\x9C(How do you do,
Pip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you are
here, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

I told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to
come and see Estella. To which he replied, \xE2\x80\x9CAh! Very fine young lady!\xE2\x80\x9D
 Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his
large hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket
were full of secrets.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?\xE2\x80\x9D said he, when
he came to a stop.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow often?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! How many times? Ten thousand times?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! Certainly not so many.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTwice?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJaggers,\xE2\x80\x9D interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, \xE2\x80\x9Cleave my Pip
alone, and go with him to your dinner.\xE2\x80\x9D

He complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While
we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved
yard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat
and drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred
times and once.

I considered, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CNever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd never will, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D he retorted, with a frowning smile. \xE2\x80\x9CShe has
never allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this
present life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays
hands on such food as she takes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPray, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cmay I ask you a question?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou may,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I may decline to answer it. Put your question.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEstella\xE2\x80\x99s name. Is it Havisham or--?\xE2\x80\x9D I had nothing to add.

\xE2\x80\x9COr what?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it Havisham?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

This brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited
us. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my
green and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a
maid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but
who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole
time. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my
guardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the
two ladies left us.

Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that
roof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to
himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella\xE2\x80\x99s face once during
dinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,
but never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often
looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his
face never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took
a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often
referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here,
again, he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he
extorted--and even did extort, though I don\xE2\x80\x99t know how--those references
out of my innocent self.

And when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him
of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that
really was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had
nothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted
the port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his
glass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and
cross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known
the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or four
times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he saw
me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his
hand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to
take notice that it was of no use, for he couldn\xE2\x80\x99t answer.

I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her
in the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her
cap,--which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,--and
strewing the ground with her hair,--which assuredly had never grown
on her head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss
Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss
Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels
from her dressing-table into Estella\xE2\x80\x99s hair, and about her bosom and
arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick
eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,
with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it.

Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and
came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the
glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of
the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in the
light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long
ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold
presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I could
never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never bear to
hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear to see
him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within
a foot or two of him,--it was, that my feelings should be in the same
place with him,--that, was the agonizing circumstance.

We played until nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock, and then it was arranged that when Estella
came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her
at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her and left
her.

My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the
night, Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s words, \xE2\x80\x9CLove her, love her, love her!\xE2\x80\x9D sounded in
my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, \xE2\x80\x9CI
love her, I love her, I love her!\xE2\x80\x9D hundreds of times. Then, a burst of
gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me, once the
blacksmith\xE2\x80\x99s boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by no means
rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she begin to be
interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her that was
mute and sleeping now?

Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never thought
there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because
I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone, and Joe
had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God forgive me!
soon dried.




Chapter XXX

After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar
in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick\xE2\x80\x99s
being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s.
\xE2\x80\x9CWhy of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said my guardian,
comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause the man
who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.\xE2\x80\x9D It seemed
quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was
not exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a
satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. \xE2\x80\x9CVery
good, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D he observed, when I had concluded, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll go round presently,
and pay our friend off.\xE2\x80\x9D Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was
for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend himself might be
difficult to deal with. \xE2\x80\x9COh no he won\xE2\x80\x99t,\xE2\x80\x9D said my guardian, making his
pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence; \xE2\x80\x9CI should like to
see him argue the question with me.\xE2\x80\x9D

As we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I
breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold
my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and
that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied,
if he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when
overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately
after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into
the open country at the back of Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s premises, I got round into
the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in
comparative security.

It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not
disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after.
One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went
a little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they
had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,--on which occasions I
don\xE2\x80\x99t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing
it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a distinguished one,
and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the
way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy.

Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I
beheld Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.
Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best
beseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced
with that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating
myself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy smote
together, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in
every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,
\xE2\x80\x9CHold me! I\xE2\x80\x99m so frightened!\xE2\x80\x9D feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and
contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed him,
his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of extreme
humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.

This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced
another two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,
and indignation, I again beheld Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy approaching. He was coming
round a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest
industry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s with
cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became
aware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his
motion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees
more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His
sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,
and I felt utterly confounded.

I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when I
again beheld Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he was
entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat,
and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of
the street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he
from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his hand, \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t know yah!\xE2\x80\x9D
 Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon
me by Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy, when passing abreast of me, he pulled up his
shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked
extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body, and drawling to his
attendants, \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t know yah, don\xE2\x80\x99t know yah, \xE2\x80\x98pon my soul don\xE2\x80\x99t know
yah!\xE2\x80\x9D The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking
to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an
exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith,
culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to
speak, ejected by it into the open country.

But unless I had taken the life of Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy on that occasion, I
really do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To
have struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower
recompense from him than his heart\xE2\x80\x99s best blood, would have been
futile and degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an
invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew
out again between his captor\xE2\x80\x99s legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,
however, to Mr. Trabb by next day\xE2\x80\x99s post, to say that Mr. Pip must
decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to
the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited Loathing
in every respectable mind.

The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my
box-seat again, and arrived in London safe,--but not sound, for my heart
was gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel
of oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then
went on to Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn.

I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.
Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the
dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend
and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the
hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to
the keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of the severity
of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than
the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him
employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park
corner to see what o\xE2\x80\x99clock it was.

Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to
Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell
you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, \xE2\x80\x9CI shall esteem and respect your
confidence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt concerns myself, Herbert,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cand one other person.\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,
and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I
didn\xE2\x80\x99t go on.

\xE2\x80\x9CHerbert,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, laying my hand upon his knee, \xE2\x80\x9CI love--I
adore--Estella.\xE2\x80\x9D

Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matter-of-course
way, \xE2\x80\x9CExactly. Well?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat next, I mean?\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert. \xE2\x80\x9COf course I know that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow do you know it?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI never told you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTold me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I
have had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since
I have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here
together. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you
told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her
the first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery well, then,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome
light, \xE2\x80\x9CI have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a most
beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And if I
adored her before, I now doubly adore her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLucky for you then, Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you are picked out for
her and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we
may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of
that fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella\xE2\x80\x99s views on the adoration
question?\xE2\x80\x9D

I shook my head gloomily. \xE2\x80\x9COh! She is thousands of miles away, from me,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CPatience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have
something more to say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am ashamed to say it,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned, \xE2\x80\x9Cand yet it\xE2\x80\x99s no worse to say it
than to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a
blacksmith\xE2\x80\x99s boy but yesterday; I am--what shall I say I am--to-day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSay a good fellow, if you want a phrase,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Herbert, smiling,
and clapping his hand on the back of mine--\xE2\x80\x9Ca good fellow, with
impetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and
dreaming, curiously mixed in him.\xE2\x80\x9D

I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture
in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognized the analysis,
but thought it not worth disputing.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,\xE2\x80\x9D I went on, \xE2\x80\x9CI
suggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have
done nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised
me; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella--\xE2\x80\x9D

(\xE2\x80\x9CAnd when don\xE2\x80\x99t you, you know?\xE2\x80\x9D Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the
fire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)

\xE2\x80\x9C--Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain
I feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden
ground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of
one person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the
best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what
they are!\xE2\x80\x9D In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been
there, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, \xE2\x80\x9Cit seems to me
that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our
gift-horse\xE2\x80\x99s mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to me
that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether
overlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn\xE2\x80\x99t you tell me that
your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were
not endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you
so,--though that is a very large If, I grant,--could you believe that of
all men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations
towards you unless he were sure of his ground?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people
often do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth
and justice;--as if I wanted to deny it!

\xE2\x80\x9CI should think it was a strong point,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I should
think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you
must bide your guardian\xE2\x80\x99s time, and he must bide his client\xE2\x80\x99s time.
You\xE2\x80\x99ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then perhaps
you\xE2\x80\x99ll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you\xE2\x80\x99ll be nearer
getting it, for it must come at last.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat a hopeful disposition you have!\xE2\x80\x9D said I, gratefully admiring his
cheery ways.

\xE2\x80\x9CI ought to have,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I have not much else. I must
acknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is
not my own, but my father\xE2\x80\x99s. The only remark I ever heard him make on
your story, was the final one, \xE2\x80\x9CThe thing is settled and done, or Mr.
Jaggers would not be in it.\xE2\x80\x9D And now before I say anything more about my
father, or my father\xE2\x80\x99s son, and repay confidence with confidence, I want
to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment,--positively
repulsive.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou won\xE2\x80\x99t succeed,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CO yes I shall!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9COne, two, three, and now I am in for it.
Handel, my good fellow;\xE2\x80\x9D--though he spoke in this light tone, he was
very much in earnest,--\xE2\x80\x9CI have been thinking since we have been talking
with our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition
of your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am
I right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never
referred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,
for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage
ultimately?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Handel, I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes, upon my
soul and honor! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself from
her?--I told you I should be disagreeable.\xE2\x80\x9D

I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh
winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued
me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly
rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post, smote upon
my heart again. There was silence between us for a little while.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; but my dear Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,
instead of silent, \xE2\x80\x9Cits having been so strongly rooted in the breast of
a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very
serious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of
what she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may
lead to miserable things.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know it, Herbert,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, with my head still turned away, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I
can\xE2\x80\x99t help it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou can\xE2\x80\x99t detach yourself?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo. Impossible!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou can\xE2\x80\x99t try, Handel?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo. Impossible!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had
been asleep, and stirring the fire, \xE2\x80\x9Cnow I\xE2\x80\x99ll endeavor to make myself
agreeable again!\xE2\x80\x9D

So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs
in their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,
looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and
came back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left
leg in both arms.

\xE2\x80\x9CI was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my
father\xE2\x80\x99s son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father\xE2\x80\x99s son
to remark that my father\xE2\x80\x99s establishment is not particularly brilliant
in its housekeeping.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is always plenty, Herbert,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, to say something encouraging.

\xE2\x80\x9CO yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest approval,
and so does the marine-store shop in the back street. Gravely, Handel,
for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as well as I do. I
suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up;
but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask you if you have ever
had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part of the country,
that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most
particularly anxious to be married?\xE2\x80\x9D

This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, \xE2\x80\x9CIs it
so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s what I want to know. Because it
is decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next me
and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little Jane
is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you
might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual
contemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already
made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew. And
indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen you are?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut it\xE2\x80\x99s a secret.\xE2\x80\x9D

I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favored with
further particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my
weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I ask the name?\xE2\x80\x9D I said.

\xE2\x80\x9CName of Clara,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert.

\xE2\x80\x9CLive in London?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, perhaps I ought to mention,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, who had become
curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting
theme, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat she is rather below my mother\xE2\x80\x99s nonsensical family notions.
Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships. I think he
was a species of purser.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is he now?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe\xE2\x80\x99s an invalid now,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Herbert.

\xE2\x80\x9CLiving on--?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COn the first floor,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,
for I had intended my question to apply to his means. \xE2\x80\x9CI have never seen
him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known Clara.
But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous rows,--roars, and
pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.\xE2\x80\x9D In looking at me and
then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively
manner.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t you expect to see him?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CO yes, I constantly expect to see him,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause
I never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the
ceiling. But I don\xE2\x80\x99t know how long the rafters may hold.\xE2\x80\x9D

When he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told
me that the moment he began to realize Capital, it was his intention
to marry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition,
engendering low spirits, \xE2\x80\x9CBut you can\xE2\x80\x99t marry, you know, while you\xE2\x80\x99re
looking about you.\xE2\x80\x9D

As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision to
realize this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my pockets.
A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention, I opened
it and found it to be the play-bill I had received from Joe, relative
to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd bless my
heart,\xE2\x80\x9D I involuntarily added aloud, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s to-night!\xE2\x80\x9D

This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve
to go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet
Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable
means, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me
by reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had
warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles,
made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mr.
Wopsle and Denmark.




Chapter XXXI

On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country
elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The
whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble
boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer
with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life,
and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white
silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My gifted
townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished
that his curls and forehead had been more probable.

Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded.
The late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled
with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it with him
to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom also carried
a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had the appearance
of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of anxiety and a
tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state
of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led to the Shade\xE2\x80\x99s being
advised by the gallery to \xE2\x80\x9Cturn over!\xE2\x80\x9D--a recommendation which it took
extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit, that
whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time
and walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely
contiguous wall. This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively.
The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically
brazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about her;
her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal (as
if she had a gorgeous toothache), her waist being encircled by another,
and each of her arms by another, so that she was openly mentioned
as \xE2\x80\x9Cthe kettle-drum.\xE2\x80\x9D The noble boy in the ancestral boots was
inconsistent, representing himself, as it were in one breath, as an able
seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a clergyman, and a person
of the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match, on the authority
of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were
judged. This gradually led to a want of toleration for him, and even--on
his being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral
service--to the general indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly,
Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of
time, she had taken off her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried
it, a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an
iron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled, \xE2\x80\x9CNow the baby\xE2\x80\x99s put
to bed let\xE2\x80\x99s have supper!\xE2\x80\x9D Which, to say the least of it, was out of
keeping.

Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with
playful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or
state a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on the
question whether \xE2\x80\x98twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes,
and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said \xE2\x80\x9CToss up for
it;\xE2\x80\x9D and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such
fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged
with loud cries of \xE2\x80\x9CHear, hear!\xE2\x80\x9D When he appeared with his stocking
disordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very neat
fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron),
a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his
leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him.
On his taking the recorders,--very like a little black flute that had
just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door,--he was
called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he recommended the
player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said, \xE2\x80\x9CAnd don\xE2\x80\x99t you do
it, neither; you\xE2\x80\x99re a deal worse than him!\xE2\x80\x9D And I grieve to add that
peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions.

But his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the appearance
of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house
on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in a
comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,
the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, \xE2\x80\x9CLook out! Here\xE2\x80\x99s the
undertaker a coming, to see how you\xE2\x80\x99re a getting on with your work!\xE2\x80\x9D
 I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle
could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,
without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;
but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the
comment, \xE2\x80\x9CWai-ter!\xE2\x80\x9D The arrival of the body for interment (in an empty
black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a general
joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of
an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended Mr. Wopsle
through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and
the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the
kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles upward.

We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;
but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,
feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I
laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;
and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly
fine in Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s elocution,--not for old associations\xE2\x80\x99 sake, I am
afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and
downhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural
circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.
When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I said
to Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9CLet us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.\xE2\x80\x9D

We made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough
either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy
smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we
came up with him,--

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Pip and friend?\xE2\x80\x9D

Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Waldengarver,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man, \xE2\x80\x9Cwould be glad to have the honor.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWaldengarver?\xE2\x80\x9D I repeated--when Herbert murmured in my ear, \xE2\x80\x9CProbably
Wopsle.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CYes. Shall we follow you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA few steps, please.\xE2\x80\x9D When we were in a side alley, he turned and
asked, \xE2\x80\x9CHow did you think he looked?--I dressed him.\xE2\x80\x9D

I don\xE2\x80\x99t know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the
addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a
blue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some
extraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen he come to the grave,\xE2\x80\x9D said our conductor, \xE2\x80\x9Che showed his cloak
beautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he
see the ghost in the queen\xE2\x80\x99s apartment, he might have made more of his
stockings.\xE2\x80\x9D

I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,
into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle
was divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just
room for us to look at him over one another\xE2\x80\x99s shoulders, by keeping the
packing-case door, or lid, wide open.

\xE2\x80\x9CGentlemen,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wopsle, \xE2\x80\x9CI am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,
you will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in
former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been
acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.\xE2\x80\x9D

Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to
get himself out of his princely sables.

\xE2\x80\x9CSkin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,\xE2\x80\x9D said the owner of that
property, \xE2\x80\x9Cor you\xE2\x80\x99ll bust \xE2\x80\x98em. Bust \xE2\x80\x98em, and you\xE2\x80\x99ll bust five-and-thirty
shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair. Keep
quiet in your chair now, and leave \xE2\x80\x98em to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

With that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who, on
the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward
with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.

I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then, Mr.
Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,--

\xE2\x80\x9CGentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), \xE2\x80\x9CCapitally.\xE2\x80\x9D So I
said \xE2\x80\x9CCapitally.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr.
Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.

Herbert said from behind (again poking me), \xE2\x80\x9CMassive and concrete.\xE2\x80\x9D So I
said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it,
\xE2\x80\x9CMassive and concrete.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Waldengarver,
with an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall at
the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man who was on
his knees, \xE2\x80\x9Cin which you\xE2\x80\x99re out in your reading. Now mind! I don\xE2\x80\x99t care
who says contrairy; I tell you so. You\xE2\x80\x99re out in your reading of Hamlet
when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed, made
the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to put a
large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal (which
was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever
his reading brought him into profile, I called out \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t see no
wafers!\xE2\x80\x9D And at night his reading was lovely.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say \xE2\x80\x9Ca faithful
Dependent--I overlook his folly;\xE2\x80\x9D and then said aloud, \xE2\x80\x9CMy view is a
little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve, they
will improve.\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you observe, gentlemen,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Waldengarver, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat there was a
man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service,--I
mean, the representation?\xE2\x80\x9D

We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I
added, \xE2\x80\x9CHe was drunk, no doubt.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO dear no, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wopsle, \xE2\x80\x9Cnot drunk. His employer would see to
that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know his employer?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

Mr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both
ceremonies very slowly. \xE2\x80\x9CYou must have observed, gentlemen,\xE2\x80\x9D said he,
\xE2\x80\x9Can ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance
expressive of low malignity, who went through--I will not say
sustained--the r\xC3\xB4le (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King
of Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!\xE2\x80\x9D

Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr.
Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,
that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces
put on,--which jostled us out at the doorway,--to ask Herbert what he
thought of having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would
be kind to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s
with us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat
until two o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing
his plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general
recollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end
with crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft
and without a chance or hope.

Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella, and
miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I
had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s Clara, or play Hamlet to
Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing
twenty words of it.




Chapter XXXII

One day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note
by the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter;
for, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed,
I divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip,
or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:--

\xE2\x80\x9CI am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. I
believe it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham
has that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you her
regard.

\xE2\x80\x9CYours, ESTELLA.\xE2\x80\x9D

If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits
of clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be
content with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew
no peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought
me either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the
coach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the
Blue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still
felt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight
longer than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I
had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when
Wemmick ran against me.

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he; \xE2\x80\x9Chow do you do? I should hardly have thought
this was your beat.\xE2\x80\x9D

I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by
coach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.

\xE2\x80\x9CBoth flourishing thankye,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cand particularly the Aged.
He\xE2\x80\x99s in wonderful feather. He\xE2\x80\x99ll be eighty-two next birthday. I have
a notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighborhood shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t
complain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.
However, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo the office?\xE2\x80\x9D said I, for he was tending in that direction.

\xE2\x80\x9CNext thing to it,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9CI am going to Newgate. We are in
a banker\xE2\x80\x99s-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road
taking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word
or two with our client.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid your client commit the robbery?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CBless your soul and body, no,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Wemmick, very drily. \xE2\x80\x9CBut he
is accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused of
it, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnly neither of us is,\xE2\x80\x9D I remarked.

\xE2\x80\x9CYah!\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger;
\xE2\x80\x9Cyou\xE2\x80\x99re a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate?
Have you time to spare?\xE2\x80\x9D

I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,
notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my
eye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether
I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and ascertained
from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his
temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected,--which
I knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick, and
affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by the information I
had received, accepted his offer.

We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge
where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison
rules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much
neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on
all public wrongdoing--and which is always its heaviest and longest
punishment--was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better
than soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their
prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup.
It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was going his
rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were buying
beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing
scene it was.

It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener
might walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his
seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat, Captain
Tom? Are you there? Ah, indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D and also, \xE2\x80\x9CIs that Black Bill behind
the cistern? Why I didn\xE2\x80\x99t look for you these two months; how do you find
yourself?\xE2\x80\x9D Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to
anxious whisperers,--always singly,--Wemmick with his post-office in
an immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he were
taking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last
observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.

He was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department
of Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers
hung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His
personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,
and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both
hands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in his
pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the
raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from
the insufficient money produced, said, \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s no use, my boy. I\xE2\x80\x99m only
a subordinate. I can\xE2\x80\x99t take it. Don\xE2\x80\x99t go on in that way with a
subordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had
better address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals
in the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may
be worth the while of another; that\xE2\x80\x99s my recommendation to you, speaking
as a subordinate. Don\xE2\x80\x99t try on useless measures. Why should you? Now,
who\xE2\x80\x99s next?\xE2\x80\x9D

Thus, we walked through Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s greenhouse, until he turned to me and
said, \xE2\x80\x9CNotice the man I shall shake hands with.\xE2\x80\x9D I should have done so,
without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.

Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can
see now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-colored frock-coat, with a
peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that
went wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner
of the bars, and put his hand to his hat--which had a greasy and fatty
surface like cold broth--with a half-serious and half-jocose military
salute.

\xE2\x80\x9CColonel, to you!\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick; \xE2\x80\x9Chow are you, Colonel?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll right, Mr. Wemmick.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEverything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong
for us, Colonel.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, it was too strong, sir,--but I don\xE2\x80\x99t care.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, coolly, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou don\xE2\x80\x99t care.\xE2\x80\x9D Then, turning to me,
\xE2\x80\x9CServed His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought his
discharge.\xE2\x80\x9D

I said, \xE2\x80\x9CIndeed?\xE2\x80\x9D and the man\xE2\x80\x99s eyes looked at me, and then looked over
my head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across
his lips and laughed.

\xE2\x80\x9CI think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D he said to Wemmick.

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps,\xE2\x80\x9D returned my friend, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut there\xE2\x80\x99s no knowing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,\xE2\x80\x9D said
the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.

\xE2\x80\x9CThankye,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. \xE2\x80\x9CSame to you, Colonel.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,\xE2\x80\x9D said the
man, unwilling to let his hand go, \xE2\x80\x9CI should have asked the favor of
your wearing another ring--in acknowledgment of your attentions.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll accept the will for the deed,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CBy the by; you were
quite a pigeon-fancier.\xE2\x80\x9D The man looked up at the sky. \xE2\x80\x9CI am told you
had a remarkable breed of tumblers. Could you commission any friend of
yours to bring me a pair, if you\xE2\x80\x99ve no further use for \xE2\x80\x98em?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt shall be done, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll right,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cthey shall be taken care of. Good afternoon,
Colonel. Good-bye!\xE2\x80\x9D They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick
said to me, \xE2\x80\x9CA Coiner, a very good workman. The Recorder\xE2\x80\x99s report is
made to-day, and he is sure to be executed on Monday. Still you see, as
far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same.\xE2\x80\x9D
 With that, he looked back, and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast
his eyes about him in walking out of the yard, as if he were considering
what other pot would go best in its place.

As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great
importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less
than by those whom they held in charge. \xE2\x80\x9CWell, Mr. Wemmick,\xE2\x80\x9D said the
turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,
and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat\xE2\x80\x99s Mr.
Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is he going to make it
manslaughter, or what\xE2\x80\x99s he going to make of it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy don\xE2\x80\x99t you ask him?\xE2\x80\x9D returned Wemmick.

\xE2\x80\x9CO yes, I dare say!\xE2\x80\x9D said the turnkey.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, that\xE2\x80\x99s the way with them here, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D remarked Wemmick, turning
to me with his post-office elongated. \xE2\x80\x9CThey don\xE2\x80\x99t mind what they ask of
me, the subordinate; but you\xE2\x80\x99ll never catch \xE2\x80\x98em asking any questions of
my principal.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs this young gentleman one of the \xE2\x80\x98prentices or articled ones of your
office?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s humor.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere he goes again, you see!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9CI told you so! Asks
another question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,
supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy then,\xE2\x80\x9D said the turnkey, grinning again, \xE2\x80\x9Che knows what Mr. Jaggers
is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYah!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious
way, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou\xE2\x80\x99re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my
principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I\xE2\x80\x99ll get him to
bring an action against you for false imprisonment.\xE2\x80\x9D

The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over
the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street.

\xE2\x80\x9CMind you, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm
to be more confidential; \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know that Mr. Jaggers does a better
thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He\xE2\x80\x99s always so
high. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities. That
Colonel durst no more take leave of him, than that turnkey durst ask him
his intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height and them, he
slips in his subordinate,--don\xE2\x80\x99t you see?--and so he has \xE2\x80\x98em, soul and
body.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian\xE2\x80\x99s
subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the
first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.

Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where
suppliants for Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s notice were lingering about as usual, and I
returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three
hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it
was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime;
that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening, I
should have first encountered it; that, it should have reappeared on two
occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone; that,
it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement. While my
mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young Estella, proud
and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence
of the contrast between the jail and her. I wished that Wemmick had not
met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him, so that,
of all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in
my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust off my feet as I
sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled
its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was
coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free
from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s conservatory, when I saw
her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me.

What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?




Chapter XXXIII

In her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful
than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was more
winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I
saw Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s influence in the change.

We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and
when it was all collected I remembered--having forgotten everything but
herself in the meanwhile--that I knew nothing of her destination.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to Richmond,\xE2\x80\x9D she told me. \xE2\x80\x9COur lesson is, that there are
two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the
Surrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage, and
you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out
of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I, but to
obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own devices, you
and I.\xE2\x80\x9D

As she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an
inner meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with
displeasure.

\xE2\x80\x9CA carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a
little?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you
are to take care of me the while.\xE2\x80\x9D

She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a
waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen
such a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,
he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clew without which he
couldn\xE2\x80\x99t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the
establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous
article, considering the hole\xE2\x80\x99s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,
and somebody\xE2\x80\x99s pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us into
another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a scorched
leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked at this
extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order; which,
proving to be merely, \xE2\x80\x9CSome tea for the lady,\xE2\x80\x9D sent him out of the room
in a very low state of mind.

I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong
combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that
the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising
proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.
Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that
with her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all happy
there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere are you going to, at Richmond?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked Estella.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going to live,\xE2\x80\x9D said she, \xE2\x80\x9Cat a great expense, with a lady there,
who has the power--or says she has--of taking me about, and introducing
me, and showing people to me and showing me to people.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, I suppose so.\xE2\x80\x9D

She answered so carelessly, that I said, \xE2\x80\x9CYou speak of yourself as if
you were some one else.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella,
smiling delightfully, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou must not expect me to go to school to you; I
must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI live quite pleasantly there; at least--\xE2\x80\x9D It appeared to me that I was
losing a chance.

\xE2\x80\x9CAt least?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Estella.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou silly boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, quite composedly, \xE2\x80\x9Chow can you talk such
nonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of
his family?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery superior indeed. He is nobody\xE2\x80\x99s enemy--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t add but his own,\xE2\x80\x9D interposed Estella, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I hate that class of
man. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite,
I have heard?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure I have every reason to say so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once
grave and rallying, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor they beset Miss Havisham with reports and
insinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,
write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment
and the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realize to yourself
the hatred those people feel for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey do me no harm, I hope?\xE2\x80\x9D

Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very singular
to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When she left
off--and she had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment--I said,
in my diffident way with her,--

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any
harm.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no you may be sure of that,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella. \xE2\x80\x9CYou may be certain that
I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and the
tortures they undergo!\xE2\x80\x9D She laughed again, and even now when she had
told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not
doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion.
I thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw
the thought in my mind, and answered it.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is not easy for even you.\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, \xE2\x80\x9Cto know what satisfaction
it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of
the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not
brought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not
your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed
and defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that
is soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round
childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a
woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up
in the night. I did.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these
remembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of
that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo things I can tell you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella. \xE2\x80\x9CFirst, notwithstanding the
proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set
your mind at rest that these people never will--never would, in hundred
years--impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great
or small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so
busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.\xE2\x80\x9D

As she gave it to me playfully,--for her darker mood had been but
Momentary,--I held it and put it to my lips. \xE2\x80\x9CYou ridiculous boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Estella, \xE2\x80\x9Cwill you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the
same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat spirit was that?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CI must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and
plotters.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you
like.\xE2\x80\x9D

I leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue\xE2\x80\x99s. \xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are to take
care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.\xE2\x80\x9D

Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon
us, and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our
intercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,
I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on
against trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it
always was.

I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clew,
brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of
tea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and
forks (including carvers), spoons (various), saltcellars, a meek little
muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover,
Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of
parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof impressions of
the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread, and
ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in with,
expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a prolonged
absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came back with
a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I steeped in hot
water, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I
don\xE2\x80\x99t know what for Estella.

The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,
and the chambermaid taken into consideration,--in a word, the whole
house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella\xE2\x80\x99s purse
much lightened,--we got into our post-coach and drove away. Turning into
Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon under the walls
of which I was so ashamed.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat place is that?\xE2\x80\x9D Estella asked me.

I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it, and then
told her. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again,
murmuring, \xE2\x80\x9CWretches!\xE2\x80\x9D I would not have confessed to my visit for any
consideration.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Jaggers,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,
\xE2\x80\x9Chas the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place
than any man in London.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe is more in the secrets of every place, I think,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, in a
low voice.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since
I can remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could
speak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with
him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnce habituated to his distrustful manner,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI have done very
well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you intimate?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have dined with him at his private house.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI fancy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, shrinking \xE2\x80\x9Cthat must be a curious place.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a curious place.\xE2\x80\x9D

I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with
her; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe
the dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden
glare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive
with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of
it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning.

So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by
which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this
side of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she
told me, for she had never left Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s neighborhood until she
had gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in
going and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her
while she remained here? To that she emphatically said \xE2\x80\x9CGod forbid!\xE2\x80\x9D and
no more.

It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;
that she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task
had needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she had
not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have
felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do
it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush
it and throw it away.

When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew
Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I
hoped I should see her sometimes.

\xE2\x80\x9CO yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you
are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.\xE2\x80\x9D

I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of
some station, though not averse to increasing her income.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is a part of Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s plans for me, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, with
a sigh, as if she were tired; \xE2\x80\x9CI am to write to her constantly and see
her regularly and report how I go on,--I and the jewels,--for they are
nearly all mine now.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she
did so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.

We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house
by the green,--a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,
embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their
court days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still
cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and
stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of
the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the
silent way of the rest.

A bell with an old voice--which I dare say in its time had often said
to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted
sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire--sounded
gravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-colored maids came fluttering
out to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she
gave me her hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed
likewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I
should be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy
with her, but always miserable.

I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in
with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our
own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party
escorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite of
his being subject to Flopson.

Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on
domestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and
servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But
Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of
the baby\xE2\x80\x99s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him quiet
during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot Guards)
of Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be regarded
as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply
externally or to take as a tonic.

Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical
advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a
highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging him
to accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she
sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign
remedy for baby, I thought--Well--No, I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t.




Chapter XXXIV

As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to
notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on
my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,
but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of
chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe. My conscience was not
by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the night,--like
Camilla,--I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should
have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s face,
and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest
old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the
fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the
kitchen fire at home.

Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of
mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part
in its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,
and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my
satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the
influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so
I perceived--though dimly enough perhaps--that it was not beneficial
to anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert.
My lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not
afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace
with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having
unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor
arts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural
bent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them
slumbering. But Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s was a very different case, and it often caused
me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his
sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing
the Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.

So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began
to contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert
must begin too, so he soon followed. At Startop\xE2\x80\x99s suggestion, we put
ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove:
the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were not
that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel
among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six
waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying social
ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I understood
nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the
society: which ran \xE2\x80\x9CGentlemen, may the present promotion of good feeling
ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.\xE2\x80\x9D

The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was
in Covent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of
joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about
town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts
at the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his equipage
headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion deliver
himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way--like coals.
But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could not be,
according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of age.

In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken
Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make
no such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every direction,
and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into keeping
late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him with a
desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about him more
hopefully about mid-day; that he drooped when he came into dinner;
that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather clearly, after
dinner; that he all but realized Capital towards midnight; and that at
about two o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the morning, he became so deeply despondent again
as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general
purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune.

I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at
Hammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert
would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those
seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that
the opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the general
tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere, was
a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew
grayer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the
hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool, read
her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about her
grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into
bed whenever it attracted her notice.

As I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing
my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing
the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn.

We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people
could make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less
miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.
There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying
ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my
belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.

Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look
about him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which
he consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an
almanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I
ever saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what
we undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a
Republic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except
at a certain hour of every afternoon to \xE2\x80\x9Cgo to Lloyd\xE2\x80\x99s\xE2\x80\x9D--in observance
of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything
else in connection with Lloyd\xE2\x80\x99s that I could find out, except come back
again. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively
must find an opening, he would go on \xE2\x80\x98Change at a busy time, and walk in
and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled
magnates. \xE2\x80\x9CFor,\xE2\x80\x9D says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one
of those special occasions, \xE2\x80\x9CI find the truth to be, Handel, that an
opening won\xE2\x80\x99t come to one, but one must go to it,--so I have been.\xE2\x80\x9D

If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated
one another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond
expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the
sight of the Avenger\xE2\x80\x99s livery; which had a more expensive and a
less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the
four-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast
became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at
breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, \xE2\x80\x9Cnot
unwholly unconnected,\xE2\x80\x9D as my local paper might put it, \xE2\x80\x9Cwith jewelery,\xE2\x80\x9D
 I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake
him off his feet,--so that he was actually in the air, like a booted
Cupid,--for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.

At certain times--meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our
humor--I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,--

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, \xE2\x80\x9Cif you will
believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, Herbert,\xE2\x80\x9D I would respond, \xE2\x80\x9Clet us look into our affairs.\xE2\x80\x9D

We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for
this purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to
confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And
I know Herbert thought so too.

We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of
something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might
be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark.
Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and
a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was something
very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.

I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a
neat hand, the heading, \xE2\x80\x9CMemorandum of Pip\xE2\x80\x99s debts\xE2\x80\x9D; with Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn
and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet of
paper, and write across it with similar formalities, \xE2\x80\x9CMemorandum of
Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s debts.\xE2\x80\x9D

Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,
which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half
burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and
otherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly,
insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this
edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. In point of
meritorious character, the two things seemed about equal.

When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?
Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful
manner at the sight of his accumulating figures.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are mounting up, Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D Herbert would say; \xE2\x80\x9Cupon my life, they
are mounting up.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBe firm, Herbert,\xE2\x80\x9D I would retort, plying my own pen with great
assiduity. \xE2\x80\x9CLook the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare
them out of countenance.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo I would, Handel, only they are staring me out of countenance.\xE2\x80\x9D

However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would
fall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the plea
that he had not got Cobbs\xE2\x80\x99s bill, or Lobbs\xE2\x80\x99s, or Nobbs\xE2\x80\x99s, as the case
might be.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it
down.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat a fellow of resource you are!\xE2\x80\x9D my friend would reply, with
admiration. \xE2\x80\x9CReally your business powers are very remarkable.\xE2\x80\x9D

I thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions,
the reputation of a first-rate man of business,--prompt, decisive,
energetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities
down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My
self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.
When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,
docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical
bundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not my
administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into a
focus for him.

My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called \xE2\x80\x9Cleaving
a Margin.\xE2\x80\x9D For example; supposing Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s debts to be one hundred and
sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, \xE2\x80\x9CLeave a margin, and
put them down at two hundred.\xE2\x80\x9D Or, supposing my own to be four times as
much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred. I had
the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound
to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive
device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent
of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of freedom and solvency it
imparted, got pretty far on into another margin.

But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these
examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable
opinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s
compliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the
table before me among the stationary, and feel like a Bank of some sort,
rather than a private individual.

We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might
not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when
we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on
the ground. \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s for you, Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, going out and coming
back with it, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I hope there is nothing the matter.\xE2\x80\x9D This was in
allusion to its heavy black seal and border.

The letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that
I was an honored sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.
Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six
in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on
Monday next at three o\xE2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon.




Chapter XXXV

It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and
the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my
sister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That
the place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed
unable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my
thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming
towards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the door.
In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated, there
was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the
sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she were
still alive and had been often there.

Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my
sister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret
which may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and
perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized with
a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered
so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully
pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.

Having written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him
that I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in
the curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the
morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the
forge.

It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times
when I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,
vividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that
softened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the beans
and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would
be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be
softened as they thought of me.

At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had
put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd
persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black
bandage,--as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort
to anybody,--were posted at the front door; and in one of them I
recognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple
into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication
rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck
with both arms. All the children of the village, and most of the women,
were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house
and forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy)
knocked at the door,--implying that I was far too much exhausted by
grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.

Another sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a
wager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlor. Here, Mr.
Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves
up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity
of black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished putting
somebody\xE2\x80\x99s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby; so he held
out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and confused by the
occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection.

Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow
under his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,
as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent
down and said to him, \xE2\x80\x9CDear Joe, how are you?\xE2\x80\x9D he said, \xE2\x80\x9CPip, old chap,
you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a--\xE2\x80\x9D and clasped my hand
and said no more.

Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly
here and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as
I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and
there began to wonder in what part of the house it--she--my sister--was.
The air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I looked
about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible until one
had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum cake upon
it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two
decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had never seen used
in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry. Standing at this
table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak
and several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing himself,
and making obsequious movements to catch my attention. The moment he
succeeded, he came over to me (breathing sherry and crumbs), and said
in a subdued voice, \xE2\x80\x9CMay I, dear sir?\xE2\x80\x9D and did. I then descried Mr. and
Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner.
We were all going to \xE2\x80\x9Cfollow,\xE2\x80\x9D and were all in course of being tied up
separately (by Trabb) into ridiculous bundles.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich I meantersay, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.
Trabb called \xE2\x80\x9Cformed\xE2\x80\x9D in the parlor, two and two,--and it was dreadfully
like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; \xE2\x80\x9Cwhich I meantersay,
sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself,
along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts
and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on
such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPocket-handkerchiefs out, all!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a
depressed business-like voice. \xE2\x80\x9CPocket-handkerchiefs out! We are ready!\xE2\x80\x9D

So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our
noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and
Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had been
brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking
ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a
horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like
a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along,
under the guidance of two keepers,--the postboy and his comrade.

The neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we
were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and
vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off,
and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such times
the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our
emergence round some corner of expectancy, \xE2\x80\x9CHere they come!\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CHere they
are!\xE2\x80\x9D and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was much annoyed
by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way
as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing
my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of
Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in
being members of so distinguished a procession.

And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the
ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,
close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this
parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was
laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the
light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.

Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,
I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even
when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought
nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like
a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him cough a
reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into
large property. When we got back, he had the hardihood to tell me that
he wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honor, and
to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the
price of her death. After that, he drank all the rest of the sherry,
and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked (which I have since
observed to be customary in such cases) as if they were of quite another
race from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal. Finally, he went
away with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble,--to make an evening of it, I felt sure,
and to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes
and my earliest benefactor.

When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men--but not his Boy; I
looked for him--had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,
the house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a
cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old
kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his
knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great
restraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe,
and when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down
together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I
noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to
make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in which
the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.

He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little
room, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great
thing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing
in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a
little talk.

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI think you might have written to me about these sad
matters.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you, Mr. Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy. \xE2\x80\x9CI should have written if I had thought
that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider
that you ought to have thought that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you, Mr. Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with
her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After
looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave up
that point.

\xE2\x80\x9CI suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COh! I can\xE2\x80\x99t do so, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still
of quiet conviction. \xE2\x80\x9CI have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am
going to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr.
Gargery, together, until he settles down.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow am I going to live?\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary
flush upon her face. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get
the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be
well recommended by all the neighbors, and I hope I can be industrious
and patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D
 pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe new
schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after
that time, and have had time since then to improve.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! Except in my bad side of human nature,\xE2\x80\x9D murmured Biddy.

It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!
I thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further
with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have not heard the particulars of my sister\xE2\x80\x99s death, Biddy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad
states--though they had got better of late, rather than worse--for four
days, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and said
quite plainly, \xE2\x80\x98Joe.\xE2\x80\x99 As she had never said any word for a long while, I
ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs to me that
she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to put her arms
round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid her head down
on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she presently said
\xE2\x80\x98Joe\xE2\x80\x99 again, and once \xE2\x80\x98Pardon,\xE2\x80\x99 and once \xE2\x80\x98Pip.\xE2\x80\x99 And so she never lifted
her head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down
on her own bed, because we found she was gone.\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were
coming out, were blurred in my own sight.

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing was ever discovered, Biddy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know what is become of Orlick?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the
quarries.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf course you have seen him then?--Why are you looking at that dark
tree in the lane?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI saw him there, on the night she died.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat was not the last time either, Biddy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.--It is of
no use,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running
out, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and
he is gone.\xE2\x80\x9D

It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by
this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told
her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of
that country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she
told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,--she
didn\xE2\x80\x99t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,--but ever did
his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a
gentle heart.

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,\xE2\x80\x9D said I; \xE2\x80\x9Cand Biddy,
we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down
here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy said never a single word.

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy, don\xE2\x80\x99t you hear me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Mr. Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,--which appears to me to be in
bad taste, Biddy,--what do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do I mean?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Biddy, timidly.

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, \xE2\x80\x9CI must request
to know what you mean by this?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBy this?\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, don\xE2\x80\x99t echo,\xE2\x80\x9D I retorted. \xE2\x80\x9CYou used not to echo, Biddy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUsed not!\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy. \xE2\x80\x9CO Mr. Pip! Used!\xE2\x80\x9D

Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another
silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI made a remark respecting my coming down here often,
to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the goodness,
Biddy, to tell me why.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?\xE2\x80\x9D asked
Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the
stars with a clear and honest eye.

\xE2\x80\x9CO dear me!\xE2\x80\x9D said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in
despair. \xE2\x80\x9CThis really is a very bad side of human nature! Don\xE2\x80\x99t say any
more, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.\xE2\x80\x9D

For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and
when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her
as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard
and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the night, and
that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what
an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.

Early in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and
looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There
I stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of
health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun
of the life in store for him were shining on it.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood-bye, dear Joe!--No, don\xE2\x80\x99t wipe it off--for God\xE2\x80\x99s sake, give me your
blackened hand!--I shall be down soon and often.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever too soon, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cand never too often, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and
a crust of bread. \xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, when I gave her my hand at parting,
\xE2\x80\x9CI am not angry, but I am hurt.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, don\xE2\x80\x99t be hurt,\xE2\x80\x9D she pleaded quite pathetically; \xE2\x80\x9Clet only me be
hurt, if I have been ungenerous.\xE2\x80\x9D

Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to
me, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy
was quite right, all I can say is,--they were quite right too.




Chapter XXXVI

Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our
debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary
transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a way of doing;
and I came of age,--in fulfilment of Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s prediction, that I should
do so before I knew where I was.

Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he had
nothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a
profound sensation in Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn. But we had looked forward to
my one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and
anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly
help saying something definite on that occasion.

I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my
birthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from
Wemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call
upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced
us that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual
flutter when I repaired to my guardian\xE2\x80\x99s office, a model of punctuality.

In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and
incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of
tissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting
it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian\xE2\x80\x99s room. It was November,
and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against
the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,
Mr. Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

We shook hands,--he was always a remarkably short shaker,--and I thanked
him.

\xE2\x80\x9CTake a chair, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said my guardian.

As I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his
boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when
I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the shelf
were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were making a
stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow my young friend,\xE2\x80\x9D my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the
box, \xE2\x80\x9CI am going to have a word or two with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you please, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you suppose,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the
ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,--\xE2\x80\x9Cwhat
do you suppose you are living at the rate of?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt the rate of, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthe--rate--of?\xE2\x80\x9D And then looked all round the room, and paused with his
pocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.

I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed
any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,
I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply
seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, \xE2\x80\x9CI thought so!\xE2\x80\x9D and blew his
nose with an air of satisfaction.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, I have asked you a question, my friend,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CHave
you anything to ask me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several
questions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAsk one,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo. Ask another.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that confidence to be imparted to me soon?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWaive that, a moment,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cand ask another.\xE2\x80\x9D

I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from
the inquiry, \xE2\x80\x9CHave-I--anything to receive, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D On that, Mr. Jaggers
said, triumphantly, \xE2\x80\x9CI thought we should come to it!\xE2\x80\x9D and called to
Wemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it in,
and disappeared.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cattend, if you please. You have been
drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s
cash-book; but you are in debt, of course?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid I must say yes, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know you must say yes; don\xE2\x80\x99t you?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t ask you what you owe, because you don\xE2\x80\x99t know; and if you did
know, you wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,\xE2\x80\x9D
 cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show
of protesting: \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s likely enough that you think you wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t, but
you would. You\xE2\x80\x99ll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this
piece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it
and tell me what it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is a bank-note,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor five hundred pounds.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is a bank-note,\xE2\x80\x9D repeated Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor five hundred pounds.
And a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow could I do otherwise!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh! But answer the question,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CUndoubtedly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that
handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this
day, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome
sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the
donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your money
affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick
one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are in
communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere
agent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my
instructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but
I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great
liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. \xE2\x80\x9CI am
not paid, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, coolly, \xE2\x80\x9Cto carry your words to any one;\xE2\x80\x9D and
then gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and
stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against
him.

After a pause, I hinted,--

\xE2\x80\x9CThere was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to
waive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me aback
to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new. \xE2\x80\x9CIs it
likely,\xE2\x80\x9D I said, after hesitating, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat my patron, the fountain-head
you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon--\xE2\x80\x9D there I delicately
stopped.

\xE2\x80\x9CWill soon what?\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s no question as it stands,
you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill soon come to London,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, after casting about for a precise
form of words, \xE2\x80\x9Cor summon me anywhere else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, here,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with
his dark deep-set eyes, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe must revert to the evening when we first
encountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person
appeared.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CJust so,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s my answer.\xE2\x80\x9D

As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my
strong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came
quicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I
had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Jaggers shook his head,--not in negativing the question, but in
altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer
it,--and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when
my eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their
suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs
of his warmed hands, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That\xE2\x80\x99s a
question I must not be asked. You\xE2\x80\x99ll understand that better, when I tell
you it\xE2\x80\x99s a question that might compromise me. Come! I\xE2\x80\x99ll go a little
further with you; I\xE2\x80\x99ll say something more.\xE2\x80\x9D

He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the
calves of his legs in the pause he made.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen that person discloses,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,
\xE2\x80\x9Cyou and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person
discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that
person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about
it. And that\xE2\x80\x99s all I have got to say.\xE2\x80\x9D

We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked
thoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion
that Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him
into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he resented
this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did object to
that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I raised my eyes
again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time, and
was doing so still.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf that is all you have to say, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D I remarked, \xE2\x80\x9Cthere can be nothing
left for me to say.\xE2\x80\x9D

He nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me
where I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.
As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favor us with his
company, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on
walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation
for him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had
his hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk
to Wemmick.

The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket,
a thought had come into my head which had been often there before;
and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with
concerning such thought.

He had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going home.
He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and
stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to
be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his hat and great-coat
ready, and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe-key, as
an athletic exercise after business.

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Wemmick,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous
to serve a friend.\xE2\x80\x9D

Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion
were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis friend,\xE2\x80\x9D I pursued, \xE2\x80\x9Cis trying to get on in commercial life,
but has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a
beginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith money down?\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.

\xE2\x80\x9CWith some money down,\xE2\x80\x9D I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across
me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home--\xE2\x80\x9Cwith some money down,
and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9CI should like just to run over with you on my
fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high
as Chelsea Reach. Let\xE2\x80\x99s see; there\xE2\x80\x99s London, one; Southwark, two;
Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.\xE2\x80\x9D
 He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his
safe-key on the palm of his hand. \xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s as many as six, you see, to
choose from.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t understand you,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CChoose your bridge, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cand take a walk upon
your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch
of your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and
you may know the end of it too,--but it\xE2\x80\x99s a less pleasant and profitable
end.\xE2\x80\x9D

I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after
saying this.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is very discouraging,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CMeant to be so,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen is it your opinion,\xE2\x80\x9D I inquired, with some little indignation,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthat a man should never--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9C--Invest portable property in a friend?\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CCertainly
he should not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,--and then it
becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid
of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd that,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cis your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, \xE2\x80\x9Cis my deliberate opinion in this office.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole
here; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut would that be your opinion at Walworth?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, with gravity, \xE2\x80\x9CWalworth is one place, and this
office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is
another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments
must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken
in this office.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery well,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, much relieved, \xE2\x80\x9Cthen I shall look you up at
Walworth, you may depend upon it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou will be welcome there, in a private and
personal capacity.\xE2\x80\x9D

We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian\xE2\x80\x99s
ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in his doorway,
towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff
out the candles. We all three went into the street together, and from
the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.

I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers
had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or
a Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable
consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all
seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he
made of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than
Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to
dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because,
after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the
fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the
details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.




Chapter XXXVII

Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s Walworth
sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage
to the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union
Jack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of
defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most
pacific manner by the Aged.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy son, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, \xE2\x80\x9Crather
had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word
that he would soon be home from his afternoon\xE2\x80\x99s walk. He is very regular
in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my son.\xE2\x80\x9D

I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and
we went in and sat down by the fireside.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou made acquaintance with my son, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said the old man, in his
chirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, \xE2\x80\x9Cat his office, I
expect?\xE2\x80\x9D I nodded. \xE2\x80\x9CHah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at
his business, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D I nodded hard. \xE2\x80\x9CYes; so they tell me. His business
is the Law?\xE2\x80\x9D I nodded harder. \xE2\x80\x9CWhich makes it more surprising in my
son,\xE2\x80\x9D said the old man, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor he was not brought up to the Law, but to
the Wine-Coopering.\xE2\x80\x9D

Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the
reputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into
the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very
sprightly manner, \xE2\x80\x9CNo, to be sure; you\xE2\x80\x99re right.\xE2\x80\x9D And to this hour I
have not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I
had made.

As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making
some other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his own
calling in life had been \xE2\x80\x9Cthe Wine-Coopering.\xE2\x80\x9D By dint of straining that
term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the
chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my meaning
understood.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said the old gentleman; \xE2\x80\x9Cthe warehousing, the warehousing. First,
over yonder;\xE2\x80\x9D he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he
intended to refer me to Liverpool; \xE2\x80\x9Cand then in the City of London here.
However, having an infirmity--for I am hard of hearing, sir--\xE2\x80\x9D

I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.

\xE2\x80\x9C--Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he
went into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and little
made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to what you
said, you know,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued the old man, again laughing heartily, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat I
say is, No to be sure; you\xE2\x80\x99re right.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled
me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this
imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall
on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little
wooden flap with \xE2\x80\x9CJOHN\xE2\x80\x9D upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried
with great triumph, \xE2\x80\x9CMy son\xE2\x80\x99s come home!\xE2\x80\x9D and we both went out to the
drawbridge.

It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the
other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with
the greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,
that I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had
come across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he
was accompanied.

Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in
the post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or
three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed
of portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both
before and behind, made her figure very like a boy\xE2\x80\x99s kite; and I might
have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves a
little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow,
and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in discovering
that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our going in,
and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing
himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a moment to
the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently another click
came, and another little door tumbled open with \xE2\x80\x9CMiss Skiffins\xE2\x80\x9D on it;
then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then Miss Skiffins
and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together. On
Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed
the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he said, \xE2\x80\x9CWell, you
know, they\xE2\x80\x99re both pleasant and useful to the Aged. And by George, sir,
it\xE2\x80\x99s a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to
this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Miss
Skiffins, and me!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Mr. Wemmick made them,\xE2\x80\x9D added Miss Skiffins, \xE2\x80\x9Cwith his own hands
out of his own head.\xE2\x80\x9D

While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green
gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was
company), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property,
and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he did this
to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I seized
the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.

Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I
had never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in
behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how
we had fought. I glanced at Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s home, and at his character, and
at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;
those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had
derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I
confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might
have done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham
in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility
of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the certainty of
his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts,
retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told Wemmick),
and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a great
affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays
upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s experience and
knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to
help Herbert to some present income,--say of a hundred a year, to keep
him in good hope and heart,--and gradually to buy him on to some small
partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help
must always be rendered without Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s knowledge or suspicion, and
that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise. I
wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder, and saying, \xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t help
confiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that
is your fault, in having ever brought me here.\xE2\x80\x9D

Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of
start, \xE2\x80\x9CWell you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is
devilish good of you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSay you\xE2\x80\x99ll help me to be good then,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CEcod,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Wemmick, shaking his head, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s not my trade.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNor is this your trading-place,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are right,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned. \xE2\x80\x9CYou hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,
I\xE2\x80\x99ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be
done by degrees. Skiffins (that\xE2\x80\x99s her brother) is an accountant and
agent. I\xE2\x80\x99ll look him up and go to work for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thank you ten thousand times.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COn the contrary,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9CI thank you, for though we are strictly in
our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there
are Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.\xE2\x80\x9D

After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into
the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The responsible
duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent
old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger
of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were going to make,
but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a hay-stack of buttered
toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron
stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum
of tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and
repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment.

The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right
moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth
as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed
the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of
John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic
infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used
to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins\xE2\x80\x99s
arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather
suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the profile of an
undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a
piece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick.

We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was
delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged
especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage
tribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins--in the
absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of
her family on Sunday afternoons--washed up the tea-things, in a trifling
lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on
her gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, \xE2\x80\x9CNow,
Aged Parent, tip us the paper.\xE2\x80\x9D

Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that this
was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite
satisfaction to read the news aloud. \xE2\x80\x9CI won\xE2\x80\x99t offer an apology,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor he isn\xE2\x80\x99t capable of many pleasures--are you, Aged P.?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll right, John, all right,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the old man, seeing himself
spoken to.

\xE2\x80\x9COnly tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cand he\xE2\x80\x99ll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,
Aged One.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAll right, John, all right!\xE2\x80\x9D returned the cheerful old man, so busy and
so pleased, that it really was quite charming.

The Aged\xE2\x80\x99s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s
great-aunt\xE2\x80\x99s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come
through a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was
always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into
them, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was
equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,
quite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we
all expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he
resumed again.

As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy
corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s mouth,
powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round
Miss Skiffins\xE2\x80\x99s waist. In course of time I saw his hand appear on the
other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly
stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm again as if it were
an article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the
table before her. Miss Skiffins\xE2\x80\x99s composure while she did this was one
of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have
thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have
deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.

By and by, I noticed Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s arm beginning to disappear again, and
gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to
widen again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite
enthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side
of Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness
of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid
it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am
justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged\xE2\x80\x99s reading,
Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to
it by Miss Skiffins.

At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time
for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a
black bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical
dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these
appliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who
was soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and
Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer to
see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had best
go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and having
passed a pleasant evening.

Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,
stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter
appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would
be glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out
to Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by
appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication
with him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was,
that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long
established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted
capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner.
Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the
subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged
for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at certain dates out of my
income: some, contingent on my coming into my property. Miss Skiffins\xE2\x80\x99s
brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but
never appeared in it.

The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the
least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the radiant
face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty
piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the young
merchant\xE2\x80\x99s name), and of Clarriker\xE2\x80\x99s having shown an extraordinary
inclination towards him, and of his belief that the opening had come at
last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter, he
must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend, for I had the
greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so
happy. At length, the thing being done, and he having that day entered
Clarriker\xE2\x80\x99s House, and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a
flush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when
I went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to
somebody.

A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my
view. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all
the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not
much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.




Chapter XXXVIII

If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to
be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O
the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within
me haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it
would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that
house.

The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a
widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother
looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother\xE2\x80\x99s complexion was
pink, and the daughter\xE2\x80\x99s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,
and the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good
position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,
if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but the
understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and
that she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss
Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s before the time of her seclusion.

In Mrs. Brandley\xE2\x80\x99s house and out of Mrs. Brandley\xE2\x80\x99s house, I suffered
every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The
nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of familiarity
without placing me on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction.
She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned the very
familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant
slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary, steward,
half-brother, poor relation,--if I had been a younger brother of her
appointed husband,--I could not have seemed to myself further from my
hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her by her
name and hearing her call me by mine became, under the circumstances
an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely that it almost
maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened
me.

She had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of
every one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them
without that.

I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used
often to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,
f\xC3\xAAte days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,
through which I pursued her,--and they were all miseries to me. I never
had one hour\xE2\x80\x99s happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the
four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me
unto death.

Throughout this part of our intercourse,--and it lasted, as will
presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,--she habitually
reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced
upon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in
this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.

\xE2\x80\x9CPip, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat
apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; \xE2\x80\x9Cwill you never
take warning?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf what?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWarning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo I mean! If you don\xE2\x80\x99t know what I mean, you are blind.\xE2\x80\x9D

I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the
reason that I always was restrained--and this was not the least of my
miseries--by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,
when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My
dread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy
disadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious
struggle in her bosom.

\xE2\x80\x9CAt any rate,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI have no warning given me just now, for you
wrote to me to come to you, this time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s true,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always
chilled me.

After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on
to say:--

\xE2\x80\x9CThe time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day
at Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She
would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,
for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can
you take me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCan I take you, Estella!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay
all charges out of my purse, You hear the condition of your going?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd must obey,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others
like it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen
her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we found her
in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless to add that
there was no change in Satis House.

She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when
I last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was
something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.
She hung upon Estella\xE2\x80\x99s beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her
gestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at
her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared.

From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to
pry into my heart and probe its wounds. \xE2\x80\x9CHow does she use you, Pip; how
does she use you?\xE2\x80\x9D she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,
even in Estella\xE2\x80\x99s hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire
at night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella\xE2\x80\x99s hand drawn
through her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her,
by dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular
letters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;
and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind
mortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch
stick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a
very spectre.

I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of
dependence and even of degradation that it awakened,--I saw in this that
Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s revenge on men, and that she
was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw
in this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her
out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with
the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,
and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in
this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while
the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my being
staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian\xE2\x80\x99s declining to
commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I
saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes,
and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct
shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden
from the sun.

The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on
the wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady
dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I looked
round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the stopped
clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and
the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection
thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in
everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated and
thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across the
landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it were, in
the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the crawlings of the
spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as they betook their
little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and
pausings of the beetles on the floor.

It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose
between Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever seen
them opposed.

We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham
still had Estella\xE2\x80\x99s arm drawn through her own, and still clutched
Estella\xE2\x80\x99s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.
She had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather
endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat!\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, \xE2\x80\x9Care you tired
of me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnly a little tired of myself,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Estella, disengaging her arm,
and moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at
the fire.

\xE2\x80\x9CSpeak the truth, you ingrate!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Havisham, passionately
striking her stick upon the floor; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are tired of me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Estella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down
at the fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a
self-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was
almost cruel.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou stock and stone!\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Miss Havisham. \xE2\x80\x9CYou cold, cold heart!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat?\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she
leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; \xE2\x80\x9Cdo you
reproach me for being cold? You?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you not?\xE2\x80\x9D was the fierce retort.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou should know,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella. \xE2\x80\x9CI am what you have made me. Take
all the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the
failure; in short, take me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO, look at her, look at her!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; \xE2\x80\x9CLook at
her so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I
took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its
stabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt least I was no party to the compact,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor if I could
walk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But what
would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe everything to
you. What would you have?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLove,\xE2\x80\x9D replied the other.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have not,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham.

\xE2\x80\x9CMother by adoption,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Estella, never departing from the easy
grace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never
yielding either to anger or tenderness,--\xE2\x80\x9Cmother by adoption, I have
said that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All
that you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that, I
have nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me, my
gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid I never give her love!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.
\xE2\x80\x9CDid I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all
times, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call me
mad, let her call me mad!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy should I call you mad,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Estella, \xE2\x80\x9CI, of all people? Does
any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I
do? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half
as well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool
that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up
into your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSoon forgotten!\xE2\x80\x9D moaned Miss Havisham. \xE2\x80\x9CTimes soon forgotten!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, not forgotten,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Estella,--\xE2\x80\x9Cnot forgotten, but treasured up
in my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have
you found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving
admission here,\xE2\x80\x9D she touched her bosom with her hand, \xE2\x80\x9Cto anything that
you excluded? Be just to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo proud, so proud!\xE2\x80\x9D moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her gray hair
with both her hands.

\xE2\x80\x9CWho taught me to be proud?\xE2\x80\x9D returned Estella. \xE2\x80\x9CWho praised me when I
learnt my lesson?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo hard, so hard!\xE2\x80\x9D moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.

\xE2\x80\x9CWho taught me to be hard?\xE2\x80\x9D returned Estella. \xE2\x80\x9CWho praised me when I
learnt my lesson?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut to be proud and hard to me!\xE2\x80\x9D Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as she
stretched out her arms. \xE2\x80\x9CEstella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard
to me!\xE2\x80\x9D

Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was
not otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at
the fire again.

\xE2\x80\x9CI cannot think,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy
you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation.
I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have never been
unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any weakness
that I can charge myself with.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWould it be weakness to return my love?\xE2\x80\x9D exclaimed Miss Havisham. \xE2\x80\x9CBut
yes, yes, she would call it so!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI begin to think,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment
of calm wonder, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I almost understand how this comes about. If you
had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of
these rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as
the daylight by which she had never once seen your face,--if you had
done that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the
daylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and
angry?\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning, and
swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.

\xE2\x80\x9COr,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella,--\xE2\x80\x9Cwhich is a nearer case,--if you had taught her,
from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,
that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her
enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had
blighted you and would else blight her;--if you had done this, and then,
for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she
could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her
face), but still made no answer.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, \xE2\x80\x9CI must be taken as I have been made. The success is
not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among
the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took advantage of
the moment--I had sought one from the first--to leave the room, after
beseeching Estella\xE2\x80\x99s attention to her, with a movement of my hand. When
I left, Estella was yet standing by the great chimney-piece, just as she
had stood throughout. Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s gray hair was all adrift upon the
ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see.

It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an
hour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about
the ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I
found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s knee, taking up some stitches
in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and
of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old
banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella
and I played at cards, as of yore,--only we were skilful now, and played
French games,--and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.

I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first
time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to
come near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this side
of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the
half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the room
overhead, in the room beneath,--everywhere. At last, when the night was
slow to creep on towards two o\xE2\x80\x99clock, I felt that I absolutely could no
longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I must get up.
I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard
into the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer courtyard and
walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no sooner in the passage
than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss Havisham going along it
in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I followed her at a distance,
and saw her go up the staircase. She carried a bare candle in her hand,
which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room,
and was a most unearthly object by its light. Standing at the bottom
of the staircase, I felt the mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without
seeing her open the door, and I heard her walking there, and so across
into her own room, and so across again into that, never ceasing the low
cry. After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back,
but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed
me where to lay my hands. During the whole interval, whenever I went to
the bottom of the staircase, I heard her footstep, saw her light pass
above, and heard her ceaseless low cry.

Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between
her and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and
there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,
did Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s manner towards Estella in anywise change, except
that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former
characteristics.

It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley
Drummle\xE2\x80\x99s name upon it; or I would, very gladly.

On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when
good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody\xE2\x80\x99s agreeing
with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order,
forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which, according
to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute\xE2\x80\x99s turn to
do that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the
decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost between us,
that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when he called upon
the company to pledge him to \xE2\x80\x9CEstella!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEstella who?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CNever you mind,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Drummle.

\xE2\x80\x9CEstella of where?\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CYou are bound to say of where.\xE2\x80\x9D Which he
was, as a Finch.

\xE2\x80\x9COf Richmond, gentlemen,\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle, putting me out of the question,
\xE2\x80\x9Cand a peerless beauty.\xE2\x80\x9D

Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I
whispered Herbert.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know that lady,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had
been honored.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you?\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd so do I,\xE2\x80\x9D I added, with a scarlet face.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you?\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle. \xE2\x80\x9CO, Lord!\xE2\x80\x9D

This was the only retort--except glass or crockery--that the heavy
creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it
as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place
and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable
Finch\xE2\x80\x99s impudence to come down to that Grove,--we always talked
about coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of
expression,--down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew
nothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by
that? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew
where I was to be found.

Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,
after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The debate
upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more honorable members
told six more, during the discussion, that they believed they knew where
they were to be found. However, it was decided at last (the Grove being
a Court of Honor) that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight
a certificate from the lady, importing that he had the honor of her
acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret, as a gentleman and a
Finch, for \xE2\x80\x9Chaving been betrayed into a warmth which.\xE2\x80\x9D Next day was
appointed for the production (lest our honor should take cold from
delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in
Estella\xE2\x80\x99s hand, that she had had the honor of dancing with him several
times. This left me no course but to regret that I had been \xE2\x80\x9Cbetrayed
into a warmth which,\xE2\x80\x9D and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the
idea that I was to be found anywhere. Drummle and I then sat snorting
at one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate
contradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to
have gone ahead at an amazing rate.

I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot
adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should
show any favor to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below
the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been referable
to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for
her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound.
No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored; but
a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of
distress.

It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle
had begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A
little while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed
one another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and Estella
held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost
flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him very well, now
scarcely remembering who he was.

The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,
however, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a
blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness,
which sometimes did him good service,--almost taking the place of
concentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching
Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil
himself and drop at the right nick of time.

At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls
at most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,
this blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration
on her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the
next opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to
take her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go.
I was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such
places.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you tired, Estella?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRather, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou should be.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSay rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to
write, before I go to sleep.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRecounting to-night\xE2\x80\x99s triumph?\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CSurely a very poor one,
Estella.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean? I didn\xE2\x80\x99t know there had been any.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEstella,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cdo look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is
looking over here at us.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy should I look at him?\xE2\x80\x9D returned Estella, with her eyes on me
instead. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,--to use
your words,--that I need look at?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CFor he
has been hovering about you all night.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMoths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Estella, with a glance
towards him, \xE2\x80\x9Chover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut cannot the Estella help it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said she, laughing, after a moment, \xE2\x80\x9Cperhaps. Yes. Anything you
like.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should
encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is
despised.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D said she.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,
ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D said she.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous
roll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don\xE2\x80\x99t you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell?\xE2\x80\x9D said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her lovely
eyes the wider.

To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it
from her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, \xE2\x80\x9CWell! Then, that is why
it makes me wretched.\xE2\x80\x9D

Now, if I could have believed that she favored Drummle with any idea of
making me-me--wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;
but in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the
question, that I could believe nothing of the kind.

\xE2\x80\x9CPip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, casting her glance over the room, \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t be foolish
about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and may be
meant to have. It\xE2\x80\x99s not worth discussing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes it is,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause I cannot bear that people should say, \xE2\x80\x98she
throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the
crowd.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI can bear it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! don\xE2\x80\x99t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCalls me proud and inflexible in this breath!\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, opening
her hands. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a
boor!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is no doubt you do,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, something hurriedly, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I have
seen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never
give to--me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you want me then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and
serious, if not angry, look, \xE2\x80\x9Cto deceive and entrap you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you deceive and entrap him, Estella?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, and many others,--all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I\xE2\x80\x99ll
say no more.\xE2\x80\x9D

* *

And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my
heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on unhindered,
to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the event that had
begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world held Estella,
and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first
distortions from Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s wasting hands.

In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of
state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the
tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through
the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof,
the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to
the great iron ring. All being made ready with much labor, and the hour
come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and the sharpened
axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his
hand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and rushed away, and
the ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near and afar, that
tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was
struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me.




Chapter XXXIX

I was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to
enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third
birthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard\xE2\x80\x99s Inn more than a year,
and lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the
river.

Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original
relations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my
inability to settle to anything,--which I hope arose out of the restless
and incomplete tenure on which I held my means,--I had a taste for
reading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of
Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have
brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.

Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and
had a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping
that to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed, I
sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.

It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud,
mud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been
driving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East
there were an Eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the gusts,
that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs;
and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills
carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of
shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages
of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the
worst of all.

Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,
and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so
exposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the
wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges
of cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed
against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they
rocked, that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.
Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could
not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors open and
looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out; and when
I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows
(opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of
such wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out,
and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and
that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being carried away
before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.

I read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book
at eleven o\xE2\x80\x99clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul\xE2\x80\x99s, and all the many
church-clocks in the City--some leading, some accompanying, some
following--struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;
and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,
when I heard a footstep on the stair.

What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the
footstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I
listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.
Remembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up
my reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had
stopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is some one down there, is there not?\xE2\x80\x9D I called out, looking
down.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said a voice from the darkness beneath.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat floor do you want?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe top. Mr. Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is my name.--There is nothing the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing the matter,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the voice. And the man came on.

I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly
within its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its
circle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere
instant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was
strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched
and pleased by the sight of me.

Moving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially
dressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-gray
hair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong
on his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to
weather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp
included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was
holding out both his hands to me.

\xE2\x80\x9CPray what is your business?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked him.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy business?\xE2\x80\x9D he repeated, pausing. \xE2\x80\x9CAh! Yes. I will explain my
business, by your leave.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you wish to come in?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied; \xE2\x80\x9CI wish to come in, master.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the
sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.
I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond
to it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and, having set the
lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to explain himself.

He looked about him with the strangest air,--an air of wondering
pleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,--and he
pulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head
was furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-gray hair grew only on
its sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the
contrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands to
me.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D said I, half suspecting him to be mad.

He stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over
his head. \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s disapinting to a man,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, in a coarse broken
voice, \xE2\x80\x9Carter having looked for\xE2\x80\x99ard so distant, and come so fur; but
you\xE2\x80\x99re not to blame for that,--neither on us is to blame for that. I\xE2\x80\x99ll
speak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.\xE2\x80\x9D

He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his
forehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him attentively
then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know him.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s no one nigh,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, looking over his shoulder; \xE2\x80\x9Cis there?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,
ask that question?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re a game one,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, shaking his head at me with a
deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating;
\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m glad you\xE2\x80\x99ve grow\xE2\x80\x99d up, a game one! But don\xE2\x80\x99t catch hold of me.
You\xE2\x80\x99d be sorry arterwards to have done it.\xE2\x80\x9D

I relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yet
I could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and
the rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the
intervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood
face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my convict
more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair before the
fire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me; no need
to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head; no
need to hug himself with both his arms, and take a shivering turn across
the room, looking back at me for recognition. I knew him before he gave
me one of those aids, though, a moment before, I had not been conscious
of remotely suspecting his identity.

He came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands.
Not knowing what to do,--for, in my astonishment I had lost my
self-possession,--I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them
heartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou acted noble, my boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CNoble, Pip! And I have never forgot
it!\xE2\x80\x9D

At a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I laid
a hand upon his breast and put him away.

\xE2\x80\x9CStay!\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CKeep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did when
I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending
your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not
necessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be something
good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not repulse
you; but surely you must understand that--I--\xE2\x80\x9D

My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at
me, that the words died away on my tongue.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou was a saying,\xE2\x80\x9D he observed, when we had confronted one another
in silence, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat surely I must understand. What, surely must I
understand?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long
ago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have
repented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad
that, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But
our ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look
weary. Will you drink something before you go?\xE2\x80\x9D

He had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly observant
of me, biting a long end of it. \xE2\x80\x9CI think,\xE2\x80\x9D he answered, still with the
end at his mouth and still observant of me, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I will drink (I thank
you) afore I go.\xE2\x80\x9D

There was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table
near the fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of the
bottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum
and water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look
at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his
neckerchief between his teeth--evidently forgotten--made my hand very
difficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with
amazement that his eyes were full of tears.

Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished
him gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and felt
a touch of reproach. \xE2\x80\x9CI hope,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, hurriedly putting something into
a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you will not
think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of doing it,
and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!\xE2\x80\x9D

As I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of his
neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and stretched
out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew his sleeve
across his eyes and forehead.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow are you living?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked him.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in
the new world,\xE2\x80\x9D said he; \xE2\x80\x9Cmany a thousand mile of stormy water off from
this.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope you have done well?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve done wonderfully well. There\xE2\x80\x99s others went out alonger me as has
done well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I\xE2\x80\x99m famous for
it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am glad to hear it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which
they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my
mind.

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,\xE2\x80\x9D I inquired, \xE2\x80\x9Csince
he undertook that trust?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever set eyes upon him. I warn\xE2\x80\x99t likely to it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes. I was
a poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little
fortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay
them back. You can put them to some other poor boy\xE2\x80\x99s use.\xE2\x80\x9D I took out my
purse.

He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he
watched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They
were clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to
him. Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them
long-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped
the ashes into the tray.

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I make so bold,\xE2\x80\x9D he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,
and with a frown that was like a smile, \xE2\x80\x9Cas ask you how you have done
well, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D

He emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with
his heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He put a foot up to the bars,
to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither
looked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only
now that I began to tremble.

When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were
without sound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it
distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.

\xE2\x80\x9CMight a mere warmint ask what property?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

I faltered, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMight a mere warmint ask whose property?\xE2\x80\x9D said he.

I faltered again, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCould I make a guess, I wonder,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Convict, \xE2\x80\x9Cat your income
since you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?\xE2\x80\x9D

With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose
out of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking
wildly at him.

\xE2\x80\x9CConcerning a guardian,\xE2\x80\x9D he went on. \xE2\x80\x9CThere ought to have been some
guardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As
to the first letter of that lawyer\xE2\x80\x99s name now. Would it be J?\xE2\x80\x9D

All the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its
disappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed
in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle
for every breath I drew.

\xE2\x80\x9CPut it,\xE2\x80\x9D he resumed, \xE2\x80\x9Cas the employer of that lawyer whose name begun
with a J, and might be Jaggers,--put it as he had come over sea to
Portsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.
\xE2\x80\x98However, you have found me out,\xE2\x80\x99 you says just now. Well! However, did
I find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for
particulars of your address. That person\xE2\x80\x99s name? Why, Wemmick.\xE2\x80\x9D

I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life.
I stood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where
I seemed to be suffocating,--I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I
grasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caught
me, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on one
knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and that I
shuddered at, very near to mine.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Pip, dear boy, I\xE2\x80\x99ve made a gentleman on you! It\xE2\x80\x99s me wot has
done it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea
should go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec\xE2\x80\x99lated and got
rich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth;
I worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do I
tell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to
know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his head
so high that he could make a gentleman,--and, Pip, you\xE2\x80\x99re him!\xE2\x80\x9D

The abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the
repugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if
he had been some terrible beast.

\xE2\x80\x9CLook\xE2\x80\x99ee here, Pip. I\xE2\x80\x99m your second father. You\xE2\x80\x99re my son,--more to me
nor any son. I\xE2\x80\x99ve put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a
hired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of
sheep till I half forgot wot men\xE2\x80\x99s and women\xE2\x80\x99s faces wos like, I see
yourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my
dinner or my supper, and I says, \xE2\x80\x98Here\xE2\x80\x99s the boy again, a looking at
me whiles I eats and drinks!\xE2\x80\x99 I see you there a many times, as plain as
ever I see you on them misty marshes. \xE2\x80\x98Lord strike me dead!\xE2\x80\x99 I says each
time,--and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens,--\xE2\x80\x98but
wot, if I gets liberty and money, I\xE2\x80\x99ll make that boy a gentleman!\xE2\x80\x99 And
I done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at these here lodgings
o\xE2\x80\x99yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall show money with lords for
wagers, and beat \xE2\x80\x98em!\xE2\x80\x9D

In his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly
fainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one
grain of relief I had.

\xE2\x80\x9CLook\xE2\x80\x99ee here!\xE2\x80\x9D he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and
turning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his
touch as if he had been a snake, \xE2\x80\x9Ca gold \xE2\x80\x98un and a beauty: that\xE2\x80\x99s a
gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; that\xE2\x80\x99s a
gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at
your clothes; better ain\xE2\x80\x99t to be got! And your books too,\xE2\x80\x9D turning his
eyes round the room, \xE2\x80\x9Cmounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And
you read \xE2\x80\x98em; don\xE2\x80\x99t you? I see you\xE2\x80\x99d been a reading of \xE2\x80\x98em when I come
in. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read \xE2\x80\x98em to me, dear boy! And if they\xE2\x80\x99re in
foreign languages wot I don\xE2\x80\x99t understand, I shall be just as proud as if
I did.\xE2\x80\x9D

Again he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood ran
cold within me.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t you mind talking, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, after again drawing his sleeve
over his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I well
remembered,--and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much
in earnest; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou can\xE2\x80\x99t do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You ain\xE2\x80\x99t
looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn\xE2\x80\x99t prepared for this as
I wos. But didn\xE2\x80\x99t you never think it might be me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO no, no, no,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned, \xE2\x80\x9CNever, never!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, you see it wos me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but my
own self and Mr. Jaggers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWas there no one else?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, with a glance of surprise: \xE2\x80\x9Cwho else should there be?
And, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! There\xE2\x80\x99s bright eyes
somewheres--eh? Isn\xE2\x80\x99t there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the
thoughts on?\xE2\x80\x9D

O Estella, Estella!

\xE2\x80\x9CThey shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy \xE2\x80\x98em. Not that a
gentleman like you, so well set up as you, can\xE2\x80\x99t win \xE2\x80\x98em off of his own
game; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,
dear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money
left me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got
my liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I went
for you. \xE2\x80\x98Lord strike a blight upon it,\xE2\x80\x99 I says, wotever it was I went
for, \xE2\x80\x98if it ain\xE2\x80\x99t for him!\xE2\x80\x99 It all prospered wonderful. As I giv\xE2\x80\x99 you
to understand just now, I\xE2\x80\x99m famous for it. It was the money left me, and
the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr. Jaggers--all for
you--when he first come arter you, agreeable to my letter.\xE2\x80\x9D

O that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,--far from
contented, yet, by comparison happy!

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look\xE2\x80\x99ee here, to know in
secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them colonists
might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say? I says
to myself, \xE2\x80\x98I\xE2\x80\x99m making a better gentleman nor ever you\xE2\x80\x99ll be!\xE2\x80\x99 When
one of \xE2\x80\x98em says to another, \xE2\x80\x98He was a convict, a few year ago, and is a
ignorant common fellow now, for all he\xE2\x80\x99s lucky,\xE2\x80\x99 what do I say? I says
to myself, \xE2\x80\x98If I ain\xE2\x80\x99t a gentleman, nor yet ain\xE2\x80\x99t got no learning, I\xE2\x80\x99m
the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a
brought-up London gentleman?\xE2\x80\x99 This way I kep myself a going. And this
way I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day
and see my boy, and make myself known to him, on his own ground.\xE2\x80\x9D

He laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for
anything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt warn\xE2\x80\x99t easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn\xE2\x80\x99t
safe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for
I was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear boy,
I done it!\xE2\x80\x9D

I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had
seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him;
even now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though those
were loud and his was silent.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere will you put me?\xE2\x80\x9D he asked, presently. \xE2\x80\x9CI must be put somewheres,
dear boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo sleep?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. And to sleep long and sound,\xE2\x80\x9D he answered; \xE2\x80\x9Cfor I\xE2\x80\x99ve been
sea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy friend and companion,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, rising from the sofa, \xE2\x80\x9Cis absent; you
must have his room.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe won\xE2\x80\x99t come back to-morrow; will he?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost
efforts; \xE2\x80\x9Cnot to-morrow.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause, look\xE2\x80\x99ee here, dear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, dropping his voice, and
laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, \xE2\x80\x9Ccaution is
necessary.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow do you mean? Caution?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBy G----, it\xE2\x80\x99s Death!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s death?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was sent for life. It\xE2\x80\x99s death to come back. There\xE2\x80\x99s been overmuch
coming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if
took.\xE2\x80\x9D

Nothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched me
with his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to come
to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him instead
of abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the strongest
admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with the
strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary, it
would have been better, for his preservation would then have naturally
and tenderly addressed my heart.

My first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen
from without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did so,
he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I saw
him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again. It
almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to file at his
leg.

When I had gone into Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s room, and had shut off any other
communication between it and the staircase than through the room in
which our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to bed?
He said yes, but asked me for some of my \xE2\x80\x9Cgentleman\xE2\x80\x99s linen\xE2\x80\x9D to put
on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and my
blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good
night.

I got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire
in the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go
to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it
was not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked I
was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.

Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not
designed for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a
sting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to
practise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first
smarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,--it was for the
convict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out
of those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,
that I had deserted Joe.

I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to
Biddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense of
my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration.
No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have
derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never,
undo what I had done.

In every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I could
have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door. With
these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I had had
mysterious warnings of this man\xE2\x80\x99s approach. That, for weeks gone by, I
had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his. That these
likenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over the sea, had
drawn nearer. That his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers
to mine, and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word,
and with me.

Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen
him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had
heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him; that
I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild
beast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a
half-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with
him in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it filled
the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my
dreadful burden.

He had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set and
lowering in his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he had
a pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the key
to the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat down
by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor.
When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of
my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five,
the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain
intensified the thick black darkness.

THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP\xE2\x80\x99S EXPECTATIONS.




Chapter XL

It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so far
as I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought pressing
on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a
distance.

The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was
self-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would
inevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service now,
but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by an
animated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room secret
from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They both had
weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in
at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted; indeed that
was their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get up a mystery
with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle
had unexpectedly come from the country.

This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness
for the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,
I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to
come with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I
fell over something, and that something was a man crouching in a corner.

As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but eluded
my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come
quickly; telling him of the incident on the way back. The wind being as
fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by
rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we examined the
staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there. It then
occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my
rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman\xE2\x80\x99s, and leaving him
standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including the room in
which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and assuredly no other
man was in those chambers.

It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on
that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the
chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram
at the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had
perceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the
night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in
the Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man
who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in
the country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the
night, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came
upstairs.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe night being so bad, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said the watchman, as he gave me back
my glass, \xE2\x80\x9Cuncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three
gentlemen that I have named, I don\xE2\x80\x99t call to mind another since about
eleven o\xE2\x80\x99clock, when a stranger asked for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy uncle,\xE2\x80\x9D I muttered. \xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou saw him, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. Oh yes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLikewise the person with him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerson with him!\xE2\x80\x9D I repeated.

\xE2\x80\x9CI judged the person to be with him,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the watchman. \xE2\x80\x9CThe person
stopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person took this
way when he took this way.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat sort of person?\xE2\x80\x9D

The watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working
person; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-colored kind of clothes
on, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the matter than I
did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching weight to it.

When I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without
prolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two
circumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent
solution apart,--as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home,
who had not gone near this watchman\xE2\x80\x99s gate, might have strayed to my
staircase and dropped asleep there,--and my nameless visitor might have
brought some one with him to show him the way,--still, joined, they had
an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a
few hours had made me.

I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the
morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been dozing a
whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an hour and
a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily,
with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder
of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep
from which the daylight woke me with a start.

All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor
could I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly
dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.
As to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an
elephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild
morning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I
sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to
appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long
I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even
who I was that made it.

At last, the old woman and the niece came in,--the latter with a head
not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,--and testified surprise
at sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in
the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were
to be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they knocked
the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream
or sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting
for--Him--to come to breakfast.

By and by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring myself to
bear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do not even know,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the
table, \xE2\x80\x9Cby what name to call you. I have given out that you are my
uncle.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s it, dear boy! Call me uncle.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you mean to keep that name?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, yes, dear boy, it\xE2\x80\x99s as good as another,--unless you\xE2\x80\x99d like
another.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is your real name?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked him in a whisper.

\xE2\x80\x9CMagwitch,\xE2\x80\x9D he answered, in the same tone; \xE2\x80\x9Cchrisen\xE2\x80\x99d Abel.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat were you brought up to be?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA warmint, dear boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

He answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some
profession.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen you came into the Temple last night--\xE2\x80\x9D said I, pausing to wonder
whether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long
ago.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, dear boy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had
you any one with you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWith me? No, dear boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut there was some one there?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI didn\xE2\x80\x99t take particular notice,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, dubiously, \xE2\x80\x9Cnot knowing the
ways of the place. But I think there was a person, too, come in alonger
me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you known in London?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI hope not!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that
made me turn hot and sick.

\xE2\x80\x9CWere you known in London, once?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWere you--tried--in London?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich time?\xE2\x80\x9D said he, with a sharp look.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe last time.\xE2\x80\x9D

He nodded. \xE2\x80\x9CFirst knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up
a knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, \xE2\x80\x9CAnd what I done is
worked out and paid for!\xE2\x80\x9D fell to at his breakfast.

He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his actions
were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed him since
I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in his mouth,
and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon
it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun with any
appetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat much as
I did,--repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and gloomily
looking at the cloth.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m a heavy grubber, dear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, as a polite kind of apology
when he made an end of his meal, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I always was. If it had been in
my constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha\xE2\x80\x99 got into lighter
trouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as
shepherd t\xE2\x80\x99other side the world, it\xE2\x80\x99s my belief I should ha\xE2\x80\x99 turned into
a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t a had my smoke.\xE2\x80\x9D

As he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the
breast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a
handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having
filled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his pocket
were a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs,
and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the hearth-rug with
his back to the fire, and went through his favorite action of holding
out both his hands for mine.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd this,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed
at his pipe,--\xE2\x80\x9Cand this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine
One! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip\xE2\x80\x99late, is, to
stand by and look at you, dear boy!\xE2\x80\x9D

I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning
slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was
chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his
hoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron
gray hair at the sides.

\xE2\x80\x9CI mustn\xE2\x80\x99t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;
there mustn\xE2\x80\x99t be no mud on his boots. My gentleman must have horses,
Pip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant
to ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood
\xE2\x80\x98uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.
We\xE2\x80\x99ll show \xE2\x80\x98em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won\xE2\x80\x99t us?\xE2\x80\x9D

He took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with
papers, and tossed it on the table.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It\xE2\x80\x99s
yourn. All I\xE2\x80\x99ve got ain\xE2\x80\x99t mine; it\xE2\x80\x99s yourn. Don\xE2\x80\x99t you be afeerd on it.
There\xE2\x80\x99s more where that come from. I\xE2\x80\x99ve come to the old country fur
to see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman. That\xE2\x80\x99ll be my
pleasure. My pleasure \xE2\x80\x98ull be fur to see him do it. And blast you all!\xE2\x80\x9D
 he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with
a loud snap, \xE2\x80\x9Cblast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to the
colonist a stirring up the dust, I\xE2\x80\x99ll show a better gentleman than the
whole kit on you put together!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CStop!\xE2\x80\x9D said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, \xE2\x80\x9CI want to speak
to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you are to
be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what projects you
have.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLook\xE2\x80\x99ee here, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly
altered and subdued manner; \xE2\x80\x9Cfirst of all, look\xE2\x80\x99ee here. I forgot myself
half a minute ago. What I said was low; that\xE2\x80\x99s what it was; low. Look\xE2\x80\x99ee
here, Pip. Look over it. I ain\xE2\x80\x99t a going to be low.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFirst,\xE2\x80\x9D I resumed, half groaning, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat precautions can be taken
against your being recognized and seized?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, dear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, in the same tone as before, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat don\xE2\x80\x99t
go first. Lowness goes first. I ain\xE2\x80\x99t took so many year to make a
gentleman, not without knowing what\xE2\x80\x99s due to him. Look\xE2\x80\x99ee here, Pip. I
was low; that\xE2\x80\x99s what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I
replied, \xE2\x80\x9CI have looked over it. In Heaven\xE2\x80\x99s name, don\xE2\x80\x99t harp upon it!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, but look\xE2\x80\x99ee here,\xE2\x80\x9D he persisted. \xE2\x80\x9CDear boy, I ain\xE2\x80\x99t come so fur,
not fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, dear boy, the danger ain\xE2\x80\x99t so great. Without I was informed
agen, the danger ain\xE2\x80\x99t so much to signify. There\xE2\x80\x99s Jaggers, and there\xE2\x80\x99s
Wemmick, and there\xE2\x80\x99s you. Who else is there to inform?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs there no chance person who might identify you in the street?\xE2\x80\x9D said
I.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, \xE2\x80\x9Cthere ain\xE2\x80\x99t many. Nor yet I don\xE2\x80\x99t intend to
advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from
Botany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who\xE2\x80\x99s to gain by it? Still,
look\xE2\x80\x99ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I should
ha\xE2\x80\x99 come to see you, mind you, just the same.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd how long do you remain?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow long?\xE2\x80\x9D said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping
his jaw as he stared at me. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m not a going back. I\xE2\x80\x99ve come for good.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere are you to live?\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is to be done with you? Where
will you be safe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, \xE2\x80\x9Cthere\xE2\x80\x99s disguising wigs can be bought
for money, and there\xE2\x80\x99s hair powder, and spectacles, and black
clothes,--shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what
others has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of
living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou take it smoothly now,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut you were very serious last
night, when you swore it was Death.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd so I swear it is Death,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, putting his pipe back in his
mouth, \xE2\x80\x9Cand Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and
it\xE2\x80\x99s serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What then,
when that\xE2\x80\x99s once done? Here I am. To go back now \xE2\x80\x98ud be as bad as to
stand ground--worse. Besides, Pip, I\xE2\x80\x99m here, because I\xE2\x80\x99ve meant it by
you, years and years. As to what I dare, I\xE2\x80\x99m a old bird now, as has
dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I\xE2\x80\x99m not afeerd
to perch upon a scarecrow. If there\xE2\x80\x99s Death hid inside of it, there is,
and let him come out, and I\xE2\x80\x99ll face him, and then I\xE2\x80\x99ll believe in him
and not afore. And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen.\xE2\x80\x9D

Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of
admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.

It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some
quiet lodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert
returned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must
be confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I
could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with
him out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so
plain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved
his consent to Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s participation until he should have seen him
and formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd even then, dear
boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of
his pocket, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe\xE2\x80\x99ll have him on his oath.\xE2\x80\x9D

To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about
the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to
state what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never
knew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of
having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his knowledge
of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that wise, gave
him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm. On this
first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he had made me swear
fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had described himself
last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude.

As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he
looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next
discussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an
extraordinary belief in the virtues of \xE2\x80\x9Cshorts\xE2\x80\x9D as a disguise, and had
in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made
him something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable
difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a
prosperous farmer\xE2\x80\x99s; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,
and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the
laundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until
his change of dress was made.

It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my
dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not
get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to
remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account
to open the door.

There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex Street,
the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of
my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so fortunate
as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I then went from
shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to the change in
his appearance. This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own
account, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his desk, but, seeing me
enter, got up immediately and stood before his fire.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cbe careful.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what
I was going to say.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t commit yourself,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cand don\xE2\x80\x99t commit any one.
You understand--any one. Don\xE2\x80\x99t tell me anything: I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to know
anything; I am not curious.\xE2\x80\x9D

Of course I saw that he knew the man was come.

\xE2\x80\x9CI merely want, Mr. Jaggers,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cto assure myself that what I have
been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least I
may verify it.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Jaggers nodded. \xE2\x80\x9CBut did you say \xE2\x80\x98told\xE2\x80\x99 or \xE2\x80\x98informed\xE2\x80\x99?\xE2\x80\x9D he asked
me, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in
a listening way at the floor. \xE2\x80\x9CTold would seem to imply verbal
communication. You can\xE2\x80\x99t have verbal communication with a man in New
South Wales, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the
benefactor so long unknown to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is the man,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cin New South Wales.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd only he?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd only he,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for
my mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss
Havisham.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAs you say, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon
me coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, \xE2\x80\x9CI am not at all
responsible for that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd yet it looked so like it, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D I pleaded with a downcast heart.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot a particle of evidence, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head
and gathering up his skirts. \xE2\x80\x9CTake nothing on its looks; take everything
on evidence. There\xE2\x80\x99s no better rule.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have no more to say,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for
a little while. \xE2\x80\x9CI have verified my information, and there\xE2\x80\x99s an end.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Magwitch--in New South Wales--having at last disclosed himself,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout
my communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of
fact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of
fact. You are quite aware of that?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CQuite, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI communicated to Magwitch--in New South Wales--when he first wrote to
me--from New South Wales--the caution that he must not expect me ever to
deviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him another
caution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at
some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I cautioned
him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all likely to
obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his natural
life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of
felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law. I gave
Magwitch that caution,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at me; \xE2\x80\x9CI wrote
it to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo doubt,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been informed by Wemmick,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking
hard at me, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from
a colonist of the name of Purvis, or--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COr Provis,\xE2\x80\x9D I suggested.

\xE2\x80\x9COr Provis--thank you, Pip. Perhaps it is Provis? Perhaps you know it\xE2\x80\x99s
Provis?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou know it\xE2\x80\x99s Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist
of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on
behalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by
return of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received the
explanation of Magwitch--in New South Wales?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt came through Provis,\xE2\x80\x9D I replied.

\xE2\x80\x9CGood day, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; \xE2\x80\x9Cglad to have
seen you. In writing by post to Magwitch--in New South Wales--or in
communicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention that
the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you,
together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining. Good
day, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D

We shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I
turned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two
vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,
and to force out of their swollen throats, \xE2\x80\x9CO, what a man he is!\xE2\x80\x9D

Wemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done
nothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found
the terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in
safety.

Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.
Whatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) than what
he had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him that made
it hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressed him and the
better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on
the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable, no
doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me; but I
believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a
weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was Convict in
the very grain of the man.

The influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and
gave him a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the
influences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,
his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his ways of
sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,--of brooding about in a
high-shouldered reluctant style,--of taking out his great horn-handled
jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,--of
lifting light glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy
pannikins,--of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it
the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make the
most of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, and then
swallowing it,--in these ways and a thousand other small nameless
instances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,
Bondsman, plain as plain could be.

It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had
conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the
effect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon
the dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was
most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of pretence,
and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. It was
abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut short.

Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful
mystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his
knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head
tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit
and look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all
the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to
start up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of
him, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first
agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for me and
the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back.
Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and begin to dress
myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave him there with
everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier.

I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those
lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the
rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on
my account, and the consideration that he could be, and the dread that
he would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he was not
asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged pack of
cards of his own,--a game that I never saw before or since, and in which
he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table,--when
he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would ask me to
read to him,--\xE2\x80\x9CForeign language, dear boy!\xE2\x80\x9D While I complied, he, not
comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire surveying me
with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between the fingers
of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to
the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary student
pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was not more
wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and recoiling
from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me and the
fonder he was of me.

This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It lasted
about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go out,
except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one
evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite
worn out,--for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful
dreams,--I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,
who had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an
instant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CQuiet! It\xE2\x80\x99s Herbert!\xE2\x80\x9D I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the
airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.

\xE2\x80\x9CHandel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again
how are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must have
been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my--Halloa! I beg
your pardon.\xE2\x80\x9D

He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by
seeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly
putting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something
else.

\xE2\x80\x9CHerbert, my dear friend,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, shutting the double doors, while
Herbert stood staring and wondering, \xE2\x80\x9Csomething very strange has
happened. This is--a visitor of mine.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s all right, dear boy!\xE2\x80\x9D said Provis coming forward, with his little
clasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. \xE2\x80\x9CTake it in
your right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in
any way sumever! Kiss it!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo so, as he wishes it,\xE2\x80\x9D I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at
me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis
immediately shaking hands with him, said, \xE2\x80\x9CNow you\xE2\x80\x99re on your oath, you
know. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan\xE2\x80\x99t make a gentleman on
you!\xE2\x80\x9D




Chapter XLI

In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet
of Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I
recounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings
reflected in Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s face, and not least among them, my repugnance
towards the man who had done so much for me.

What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there
had been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.
Saving his troublesome sense of having been \xE2\x80\x9Clow\xE2\x80\x9D on one occasion since
his return,--on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the
moment my revelation was finished,--he had no perception of the
possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast that
he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support the
character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for
himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,
and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite
established in his own mind.

\xE2\x80\x9CThough, look\xE2\x80\x99ee here, Pip\xE2\x80\x99s comrade,\xE2\x80\x9D he said to Herbert, after having
discoursed for some time, \xE2\x80\x9CI know very well that once since I come
back--for half a minute--I\xE2\x80\x99ve been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had
been low. But don\xE2\x80\x99t you fret yourself on that score. I ain\xE2\x80\x99t made Pip a
gentleman, and Pip ain\xE2\x80\x99t a going to make you a gentleman, not fur me not
to know what\xE2\x80\x99s due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pip\xE2\x80\x99s comrade, you two may
count upon me always having a gen-teel muzzle on. Muzzled I have been
since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled I am
at the present time, muzzled I ever will be.\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert said, \xE2\x80\x9CCertainly,\xE2\x80\x9D but looked as if there were no specific
consolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were
anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us
together, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat
late. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and
saw him safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I
experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of
his arrival.

Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs,
I had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in
bringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a
large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is
conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that any
of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who were
passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty when I
turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate with us,
nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the fountain, I saw
his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and, when I stood for
a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before going
up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase
was when I ascended it.

Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so
blessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound
words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the
question, What was to be done?

The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had
stood,--for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in
one unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with
his pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,
and what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,--I say his
chair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but
next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had
no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my
patron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that
confidence without shaping a syllable.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat,\xE2\x80\x9D said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,--\xE2\x80\x9Cwhat is
to be done?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy poor dear Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D he replied, holding his head, \xE2\x80\x9CI am too stunned
to think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be
done. He is intent upon various new expenses,--horses, and carriages,
and lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou mean that you can\xE2\x80\x99t accept--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow can I?\xE2\x80\x9D I interposed, as Herbert paused. \xE2\x80\x9CThink of him! Look at
him!\xE2\x80\x9D

An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.

\xE2\x80\x9CYet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to
me, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy poor dear Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D Herbert repeated.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cafter all, stopping short here, never taking another
penny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily
in debt,--very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,--and I have
been bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, well, well!\xE2\x80\x9D Herbert remonstrated. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t say fit for nothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that
is, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for
the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.\xE2\x80\x9D

Of course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a
warm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnyhow, my dear Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D said he presently, \xE2\x80\x9Csoldiering won\xE2\x80\x99t do. If
you were to renounce this patronage and these favors, I suppose you
would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have
already had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!
Besides, it\xE2\x80\x99s absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker\xE2\x80\x99s
house, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

Poor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut there is another question,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert. \xE2\x80\x9CThis is an ignorant,
determined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he
seems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce
character.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know he is,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned. \xE2\x80\x9CLet me tell you what evidence I have seen
of it.\xE2\x80\x9D And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of that
encounter with the other convict.

\xE2\x80\x9CSee, then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert; \xE2\x80\x9Cthink of this! He comes here at the peril
of his life, for the realization of his fixed idea. In the moment of
realization, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from
under his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.
Do you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night
of his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his
putting himself in the way of being taken.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen you may rely upon it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat there would be great
danger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he remains
in England, and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon
me from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard
myself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my
chair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that
even if Provis were recognized and taken, in spite of himself, I should
be wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so
wretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would
far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would
ever have come to this!

But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?

\xE2\x80\x9CThe first and the main thing to be done,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cis to get him
out of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be induced
to go.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMy good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street,
there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and
making him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get him away
could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything else in his
life, now.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere, again!\xE2\x80\x9D said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands held
out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. \xE2\x80\x9CI know nothing
of his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see
him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so
unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days
in my childhood!\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and
fro together, studying the carpet.

\xE2\x80\x9CHandel,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, stopping, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou feel convinced that you can take
no further benefits from him; do you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you feel convinced that you must break with him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHerbert, can you ask me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he
has risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from
throwing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir a
finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in Heaven\xE2\x80\x99s
name, and we\xE2\x80\x99ll see it out together, dear old boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,
with only that done.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Herbert,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cwith reference to gaining some knowledge of
his history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him point
blank.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. Ask him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen we sit at breakfast in the morning.\xE2\x80\x9D
 For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would come to
breakfast with us.

With this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams
concerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear
which I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned
transport. Waking, I never lost that fear.

He came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and sat
down to his meal. He was full of plans \xE2\x80\x9Cfor his gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s coming out
strong, and like a gentleman,\xE2\x80\x9D and urged me to begin speedily upon
the pocket-book which he had left in my possession. He considered the
chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to
look out at once for a \xE2\x80\x9Cfashionable crib\xE2\x80\x9D near Hyde Park, in which he
could have \xE2\x80\x9Ca shake-down.\xE2\x80\x9D When he had made an end of his breakfast,
and was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of
preface,--

\xE2\x80\x9CAfter you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that
the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You
remember?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRemember!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CI think so!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe want to know something about that man--and about you. It is strange
to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to
tell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing
more?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D he said, after consideration. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re on your oath, you know,
Pip\xE2\x80\x99s comrade?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAssuredly,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Herbert.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs to anything I say, you know,\xE2\x80\x9D he insisted. \xE2\x80\x9CThe oath applies to
all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI understand it to do so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd look\xE2\x80\x99ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,\xE2\x80\x9D he
insisted again.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo be it.\xE2\x80\x9D

He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,
when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think
it might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,
stuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each knee,
and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments,
looked round at us and said what follows.




Chapter XLII

\xE2\x80\x9CDear boy and Pip\xE2\x80\x99s comrade. I am not a going fur to tell you my life
like a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I\xE2\x80\x99ll
put it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in
jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you\xE2\x80\x99ve got it.
That\xE2\x80\x99s my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,
arter Pip stood my friend.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve been done everything to, pretty well--except hanged. I\xE2\x80\x99ve been
locked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I\xE2\x80\x99ve been carted here and
carted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and
stuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I\xE2\x80\x99ve no more
notion where I was born than you have--if so much. I first become aware
of myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had
run away from me--a man--a tinker--and he\xE2\x80\x99d took the fire with him, and
left me wery cold.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know\xE2\x80\x99d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen\xE2\x80\x99d Abel. How did I know
it? Much as I know\xE2\x80\x99d the birds\xE2\x80\x99 names in the hedges to be chaffinch,
sparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as
the birds\xE2\x80\x99 names come out true, I supposed mine did.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo fur as I could find, there warn\xE2\x80\x99t a soul that see young Abel
Magwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at him,
and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up, took
up, to that extent that I reg\xE2\x80\x99larly grow\xE2\x80\x99d up took up.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as much
to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for there
warn\xE2\x80\x99t many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the name of
being hardened. \xE2\x80\x98This is a terrible hardened one,\xE2\x80\x99 they says to prison
wisitors, picking out me. \xE2\x80\x98May be said to live in jails, this boy.\xE2\x80\x99 Then
they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured my head, some
on \xE2\x80\x98em,--they had better a measured my stomach,--and others on \xE2\x80\x98em giv
me tracts what I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t read, and made me speeches what I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t
understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But what
the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach, mustn\xE2\x80\x99t
I?--Howsomever, I\xE2\x80\x99m a getting low, and I know what\xE2\x80\x99s due. Dear boy and
Pip\xE2\x80\x99s comrade, don\xE2\x80\x99t you be afeerd of me being low.

\xE2\x80\x9CTramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,--though
that warn\xE2\x80\x99t as often as you may think, till you put the question whether
you would ha\xE2\x80\x99 been over-ready to give me work yourselves,--a bit of a
poacher, a bit of a laborer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a haymaker,
a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don\xE2\x80\x99t pay and lead to
trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a Traveller\xE2\x80\x99s Rest,
what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read;
and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me
to write. I warn\xE2\x80\x99t locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my
good share of key-metal still.

\xE2\x80\x9CAt Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi\xE2\x80\x99
a man whose skull I\xE2\x80\x99d crack wi\xE2\x80\x99 this poker, like the claw of a lobster,
if I\xE2\x80\x99d got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and that\xE2\x80\x99s the
man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch, according to
what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he\xE2\x80\x99d been to a public
boarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was
a dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the
night afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth
that I know\xE2\x80\x99d on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when
I went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a
sporting one) called him out, and said, \xE2\x80\x98I think this is a man that
might suit you,\xE2\x80\x99--meaning I was.

\xE2\x80\x9CCompeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a
watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of
clothes.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98To judge from appearances, you\xE2\x80\x99re out of luck,\xE2\x80\x99 says Compeyson to me.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Yes, master, and I\xE2\x80\x99ve never been in it much.\xE2\x80\x99 (I had come out of
Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have
been for something else; but it warn\xE2\x80\x99t.)

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Luck changes,\xE2\x80\x99 says Compeyson; \xE2\x80\x98perhaps yours is going to change.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CI says, \xE2\x80\x98I hope it may be so. There\xE2\x80\x99s room.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98What can you do?\xE2\x80\x99 says Compeyson.

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Eat and drink,\xE2\x80\x99 I says; \xE2\x80\x98if you\xE2\x80\x99ll find the materials.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CCompeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five
shillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.

\xE2\x80\x9CI went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on
to be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson\xE2\x80\x99s business in which we
was to go pardners? Compeyson\xE2\x80\x99s business was the swindling, handwriting
forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts of traps as
Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs out of and get
the profits from and let another man in for, was Compeyson\xE2\x80\x99s business.
He\xE2\x80\x99d no more heart than a iron file, he was as cold as death, and he had
the head of the Devil afore mentioned.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,--not as
being so chrisen\xE2\x80\x99d, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a
shadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a
rich lady some years afore, and they\xE2\x80\x99d made a pot of money by it; but
Compeyson betted and gamed, and he\xE2\x80\x99d have run through the king\xE2\x80\x99s taxes.
So, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,
and Compeyson\xE2\x80\x99s wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity
on him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and
nobody.

\xE2\x80\x9CI might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn\xE2\x80\x99t; and I won\xE2\x80\x99t pretend I
was partick\xE2\x80\x99ler--for where \xE2\x80\x98ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?
So I begun wi\xE2\x80\x99 Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur
lived at the top of Compeyson\xE2\x80\x99s house (over nigh Brentford it was), and
Compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in case
he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled the
account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a tearing
down into Compeyson\xE2\x80\x99s parlor late at night, in only a flannel gown, with
his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson\xE2\x80\x99s wife, \xE2\x80\x98Sally, she
really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can\xE2\x80\x99t get rid of her. She\xE2\x80\x99s
all in white,\xE2\x80\x99 he says, \xE2\x80\x98wi\xE2\x80\x99 white flowers in her hair, and she\xE2\x80\x99s awful
mad, and she\xE2\x80\x99s got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she says she\xE2\x80\x99ll
put it on me at five in the morning.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CSays Compeyson: \xE2\x80\x98Why, you fool, don\xE2\x80\x99t you know she\xE2\x80\x99s got a living body?
And how should she be up there, without coming through the door, or in
at the window, and up the stairs?\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98I don\xE2\x80\x99t know how she\xE2\x80\x99s there,\xE2\x80\x99 says Arthur, shivering dreadful with
the horrors, \xE2\x80\x98but she\xE2\x80\x99s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,
awful mad. And over where her heart\xE2\x80\x99s broke--you broke it!--there\xE2\x80\x99s
drops of blood.\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CCompeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. \xE2\x80\x98Go up alonger this
drivelling sick man,\xE2\x80\x99 he says to his wife, \xE2\x80\x98and Magwitch, lend her a
hand, will you?\xE2\x80\x99 But he never come nigh himself.

\xE2\x80\x9CCompeyson\xE2\x80\x99s wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most
dreadful. \xE2\x80\x98Why look at her!\xE2\x80\x99 he cries out. \xE2\x80\x98She\xE2\x80\x99s a shaking the shroud
at me! Don\xE2\x80\x99t you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain\xE2\x80\x99t it awful to see her so
mad?\xE2\x80\x99 Next he cries, \xE2\x80\x98She\xE2\x80\x99ll put it on me, and then I\xE2\x80\x99m done for! Take
it away from her, take it away!\xE2\x80\x99 And then he catched hold of us, and kep
on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed I see
her myself.

\xE2\x80\x9CCompeyson\xE2\x80\x99s wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the
horrors off, and by and by he quieted. \xE2\x80\x98O, she\xE2\x80\x99s gone! Has her keeper
been for her?\xE2\x80\x99 he says. \xE2\x80\x98Yes,\xE2\x80\x99 says Compeyson\xE2\x80\x99s wife. \xE2\x80\x98Did you tell him
to lock her and bar her in?\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x98Yes.\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x98And to take that ugly thing away
from her?\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x98Yes, yes, all right.\xE2\x80\x99 \xE2\x80\x98You\xE2\x80\x99re a good creetur,\xE2\x80\x99 he says,
\xE2\x80\x98don\xE2\x80\x99t leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!\xE2\x80\x99

\xE2\x80\x9CHe rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and
then he starts up with a scream, and screams out, \xE2\x80\x98Here she is! She\xE2\x80\x99s
got the shroud again. She\xE2\x80\x99s unfolding it. She\xE2\x80\x99s coming out of the
corner. She\xE2\x80\x99s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you--one of each
side--don\xE2\x80\x99t let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.
Don\xE2\x80\x99t let her throw it over my shoulders. Don\xE2\x80\x99t let her lift me up to
get it round me. She\xE2\x80\x99s lifting me up. Keep me down!\xE2\x80\x99 Then he lifted
himself up hard, and was dead.

\xE2\x80\x9CCompeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and
me was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own
book,--this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade
on.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done--which \xE2\x80\x98ud
take a week--I\xE2\x80\x99ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip\xE2\x80\x99s comrade, that
that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always
in debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a
getting into danger. He was younger than me, but he\xE2\x80\x99d got craft, and
he\xE2\x80\x99d got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and
no mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi\xE2\x80\x99--Stop though! I ain\xE2\x80\x99t
brought her in--\xE2\x80\x9D

He looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in
the book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and
spread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them
on again.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere ain\xE2\x80\x99t no need to go into it,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, looking round once more.
\xE2\x80\x9CThe time wi\xE2\x80\x99 Compeyson was a\xE2\x80\x99most as hard a time as ever I had; that
said, all\xE2\x80\x99s said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor,
while with Compeyson?\xE2\x80\x9D

I answered, No.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D he said, \xE2\x80\x9CI was, and got convicted. As to took up on suspicion,
that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted;
but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both committed
for felony,--on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation,--and
there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me, \xE2\x80\x98Separate
defences, no communication,\xE2\x80\x99 and that was all. And I was so miserable
poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back,
afore I could get Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman
Compeyson looked, wi\xE2\x80\x99 his curly hair and his black clothes and his white
pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked. When
the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I
noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the
evidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had
come for\xE2\x80\x99ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money
had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing
and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see the plan
plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, \xE2\x80\x98My lord and gentlemen,
here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can
separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to
as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such;
one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and
only suspected; t\xE2\x80\x99other, the elder, always seen in \xE2\x80\x98em and always wi\xE2\x80\x99 his
guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is
the one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one?\xE2\x80\x99 And
such-like. And when it come to character, warn\xE2\x80\x99t it Compeyson as had
been to the school, and warn\xE2\x80\x99t it his schoolfellows as was in this
position and in that, and warn\xE2\x80\x99t it him as had been know\xE2\x80\x99d by witnesses
in such clubs and societies, and nowt to his disadvantage? And warn\xE2\x80\x99t it
me as had been tried afore, and as had been know\xE2\x80\x99d up hill and down dale
in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when it come to speech-making, warn\xE2\x80\x99t it
Compeyson as could speak to \xE2\x80\x98em wi\xE2\x80\x99 his face dropping every now and then
into his white pocket-handkercher,--ah! and wi\xE2\x80\x99 verses in his speech,
too,--and warn\xE2\x80\x99t it me as could only say, \xE2\x80\x98Gentlemen, this man at my
side is a most precious rascal\xE2\x80\x99? And when the verdict come, warn\xE2\x80\x99t it
Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and
bad company, and giving up all the information he could agen me,
and warn\xE2\x80\x99t it me as got never a word but Guilty? And when I says to
Compeyson, \xE2\x80\x98Once out of this court, I\xE2\x80\x99ll smash that face of yourn!\xE2\x80\x99
ain\xE2\x80\x99t it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two
turnkeys stood betwixt us? And when we\xE2\x80\x99re sentenced, ain\xE2\x80\x99t it him as
gets seven year, and me fourteen, and ain\xE2\x80\x99t it him as the Judge is
sorry for, because he might a done so well, and ain\xE2\x80\x99t it me as the Judge
perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to
worse?\xE2\x80\x9D

He had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked
it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching
out his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, \xE2\x80\x9CI ain\xE2\x80\x99t a going
to be low, dear boy!\xE2\x80\x9D

He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his
face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.

\xE2\x80\x9CI had said to Compeyson that I\xE2\x80\x99d smash that face of his, and I swore
Lord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I
couldn\xE2\x80\x99t get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him
and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at
him, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn\xE2\x80\x99t
a strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I
escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying
them as was in \xE2\x80\x98em and all over, when I first see my boy!\xE2\x80\x9D

He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent
to me again, though I had felt great pity for him.

\xE2\x80\x9CBy my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes
too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to get quit
of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him down. I
smashed his face. \xE2\x80\x98And now,\xE2\x80\x99 says I \xE2\x80\x98as the worst thing I can do, caring
nothing for myself, I\xE2\x80\x99ll drag you back.\xE2\x80\x99 And I\xE2\x80\x99d have swum off, towing
him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I\xE2\x80\x99d a got him aboard
without the soldiers.

\xE2\x80\x9COf course he\xE2\x80\x99d much the best of it to the last,--his character was so
good. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous
intentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought
to trial again, and sent for life. I didn\xE2\x80\x99t stop for life, dear boy and
Pip\xE2\x80\x99s comrade, being here.\xE2\x80\x9D

He wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took
his tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his
button-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he dead?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked, after a silence.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs who dead, dear boy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCompeyson.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe hopes I am, if he\xE2\x80\x99s alive, you may be sure,\xE2\x80\x9D with a fierce look. \xE2\x80\x9CI
never heerd no more of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He
softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his eyes
on the fire, and I read in it:--

\xE2\x80\x9CYoung Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to
be Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s lover.\xE2\x80\x9D

I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by; but
we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he stood
smoking by the fire.




Chapter XLIII

Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be
traced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state
of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison
before meeting her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which
I now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty,
and the returned transport whom I harbored? The road would be none the
smoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would not
be helped, nor I extenuated.

A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather,
his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already
there. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I could
hardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of
him, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any
such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release
himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an
informer was scarcely to be imagined.

Never had I breathed, and never would I breathe--or so I resolved--a
word of Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could
go abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when we
were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story. I
resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.

On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley\xE2\x80\x99s, Estella\xE2\x80\x99s maid was called to
tell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House, as
usual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone there without
me; when was she coming back? There was an air of reservation in the
answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that her maid
believed she was only coming back at all for a little while. I could
make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make
nothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.

Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I
always took him home, and always looked well about me), led us to the
conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came
back from Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to
consider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should
devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious
observation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose
an expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything, and he
would consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his present
hazard was not to be thought of.

Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise
to go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe
or his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and
Herbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be
absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his
impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to
be begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to
Herbert also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that
pretence,--as, to make purchases, or the like.

Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, I set
off by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out
on the open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and
whimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of
mist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly
ride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,
to look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!

As he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a very
lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into the
coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I
ordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very
well knew why he had come there.

Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had
nothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of
coffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which
it was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly
irregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By
degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the
fire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my
hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to
stir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs this a cut?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Drummle.

\xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D said I, poker in hand; \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s you, is it? How do you do? I was
wondering who it was, who kept the fire off.\xE2\x80\x9D

With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself side
by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the fire.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have just come down?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away
with his shoulder.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, edging him a little away with my shoulder.

\xE2\x80\x9CBeastly place,\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle. \xE2\x80\x9CYour part of the country, I think?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D I assented. \xE2\x80\x9CI am told it\xE2\x80\x99s very like your Shropshire.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot in the least like it,\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle.

Here Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.
Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you been here long?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked, determined not to yield an inch of
the fire.

\xE2\x80\x9CLong enough to be tired of it,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,
but equally determined.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you stay here long?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCan\xE2\x80\x99t say,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Mr. Drummle. \xE2\x80\x9CDo you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCan\xE2\x80\x99t say,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle\xE2\x80\x99s
shoulder had claimed another hair\xE2\x80\x99s breadth of room, I should have
jerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged a
similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box. He
whistled a little. So did I.

\xE2\x80\x9CLarge tract of marshes about here, I believe?\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. What of that?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

Mr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, \xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D and
laughed.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you amused, Mr. Drummle?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cnot particularly. I am going out for a ride in the
saddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way
villages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses--and
smithies--and that. Waiter!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs that horse of mine ready?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBrought round to the door, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI say. Look here, you sir. The lady won\xE2\x80\x99t ride to-day; the weather
won\xE2\x80\x99t do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery good, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd I don\xE2\x80\x99t dine, because I\xE2\x80\x99m going to dine at the lady\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CVery good, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his
great-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so
exasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the
robber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat
him on the fire.

One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief
came, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well
squared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our
hands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in
the drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle\xE2\x80\x99s
was cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both
stood our ground.

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you been to the Grove since?\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was
there.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWas that when we had a difference of opinion?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D I replied, very shortly.

\xE2\x80\x9CCome, come! They let you off easily enough,\xE2\x80\x9D sneered Drummle. \xE2\x80\x9CYou
shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have lost your temper.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Drummle,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are not competent to give advice on that
subject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that
occasion), I don\xE2\x80\x99t throw glasses.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do,\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle.

After glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of
smouldering ferocity, I said,--

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don\xE2\x80\x99t think it an
agreeable one.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am sure it\xE2\x80\x99s not,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, superciliously over his shoulder; \xE2\x80\x9CI
don\xE2\x80\x99t think anything about it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd therefore,\xE2\x80\x9D I went on, \xE2\x80\x9Cwith your leave, I will suggest that we
hold no kind of communication in future.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CQuite my opinion,\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle, \xE2\x80\x9Cand what I should have suggested
myself, or done--more likely--without suggesting. But don\xE2\x80\x99t lose your
temper. Haven\xE2\x80\x99t you lost enough without that?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean, sir?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWaiter!\xE2\x80\x9D said Drummle, by way of answering me.

The waiter reappeared.

\xE2\x80\x9CLook here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don\xE2\x80\x99t ride
to-day, and that I dine at the young lady\xE2\x80\x99s?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CQuite so, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D

When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his
hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,
careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket
and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and
boiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without
introducing Estella\xE2\x80\x99s name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;
and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were
no one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have
remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but
for the incursion of three thriving farmers--laid on by the waiter, I
think--who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and
rubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we
were obliged to give way.

I saw him through the window, seizing his horse\xE2\x80\x99s mane, and mounting in
his blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought
he was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in his
mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-colored dress appeared
with what was wanted,--I could not have said from where: whether from
the inn yard, or the street, or where not,--and as Drummle leaned down
from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a jerk of his
head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged
hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick.

Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or
no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the
journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house
that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered,
never to have seen.




Chapter XLIV

In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles
burnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham
seated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.
Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both raised
their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I derived
that, from the look they interchanged.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what wind,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham, \xE2\x80\x9Cblows you here, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.
Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and
then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as
plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived I
had discovered my real benefactor.

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to
Estella; and finding that some wind had blown her here, I followed.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,
I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her
occupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural
place for me, that day.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,
presently--in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not
displease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.\xE2\x80\x9D

Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the
action of Estella\xE2\x80\x99s fingers as they worked that she attended to what I
said; but she did not look up.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,
and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,
anything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not my
secret, but another\xE2\x80\x99s.\xE2\x80\x9D

As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to
go on, Miss Havisham repeated, \xE2\x80\x9CIt is not your secret, but another\xE2\x80\x99s.
Well?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I
belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left,
I suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have
come,--as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid
for it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAy, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; \xE2\x80\x9Cyou did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd that Mr. Jaggers--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Jaggers,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, \xE2\x80\x9Chad
nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and
his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same
relation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that
as it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.\xE2\x80\x9D

Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no
suppression or evasion so far.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least
you led me on?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D she returned, again nodding steadily, \xE2\x80\x9CI let you go on.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWas that kind?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho am I,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor
and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in
surprise,--\xE2\x80\x9Cwho am I, for God\xE2\x80\x99s sake, that I should be kind?\xE2\x80\x9D

It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I
told her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, well, well!\xE2\x80\x9D she said. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI was liberally paid for my old attendance here,\xE2\x80\x9D I said, to soothe
her, \xE2\x80\x9Cin being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for
my own information. What follows has another (and I hope more
disinterested) purpose. In humoring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you
punished--practised on--perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses
your intention, without offence--your self-seeking relations?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my
history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you
not to have it so! You made your own snares. I never made them.\xE2\x80\x9D

Waiting until she was quiet again,--for this, too, flashed out of her in
a wild and sudden way,--I went on.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,
and have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them
to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be
false and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you or
no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that you
deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you suppose
them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and incapable of
anything designing or mean.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey are your friends,\xE2\x80\x9D said Miss Havisham.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey made themselves my friends,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen they supposed me
to have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and
Mistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.\xE2\x80\x9D

This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do
them good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and then
said quietly,--

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you want for them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COnly,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat you would not confound them with the others. They
may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same
nature.\xE2\x80\x9D

Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,--

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you want for them?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am not so cunning, you see,\xE2\x80\x9D I said, in answer, conscious that I
reddened a little, \xE2\x80\x9Cas that I could hide from you, even if I desired,
that I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money
to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the
nature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you
how.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy must it be done without his knowledge?\xE2\x80\x9D she asked, settling her
hands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI began the service myself, more than two years ago,
without his knowledge, and I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to be betrayed. Why I fail in my
ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the secret which
is another person\xE2\x80\x99s and not mine.\xE2\x80\x9D

She gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.
After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light
of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by
the collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again--at
first, vacantly--then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All
this time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her
attention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in our
dialogue,--

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEstella,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my
trembling voice, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou know I love you. You know that I have loved you
long and dearly.\xE2\x80\x9D

She raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her fingers
plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance. I
saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from her to me.

\xE2\x80\x9CI should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me
to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought you
could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it. But I
must say it now.\xE2\x80\x9D

Preserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,
Estella shook her head.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, in answer to that action,--\xE2\x80\x9CI know. I have no hope
that I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become
of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love
you. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.\xE2\x80\x9D

Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook her
head again.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise
on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all these
years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected on the
gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that, in the
endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.\xE2\x80\x9D

I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she
sat looking by turns at Estella and at me.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt seems,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, very calmly, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat there are sentiments,
fancies,--I don\xE2\x80\x99t know how to call them,--which I am not able to
comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form
of words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch
nothing there. I don\xE2\x80\x99t care for what you say at all. I have tried to
warn you of this; now, have I not?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said in a miserable manner, \xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.
Now, did you not think so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and
beautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is in my nature,\xE2\x80\x9D she returned. And then she added, with a stress
upon the words, \xE2\x80\x9CIt is in the nature formed within me. I make a great
difference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can do
no more.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it not true,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat Bentley Drummle is in town here, and
pursuing you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is quite true,\xE2\x80\x9D she replied, referring to him with the indifference
of utter contempt.

\xE2\x80\x9CThat you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with
you this very day?\xE2\x80\x9D

She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,
\xE2\x80\x9CQuite true.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou cannot love him, Estella!\xE2\x80\x9D

Her fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,
\xE2\x80\x9CWhat have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do not
mean what I say?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou would never marry him, Estella?\xE2\x80\x9D

She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her
work in her hands. Then she said, \xE2\x80\x9CWhy not tell you the truth? I am
going to be married to him.\xE2\x80\x9D

I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better
than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear
her say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a
ghastly look upon Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, that it impressed me, even in my
passionate hurry and grief.

\xE2\x80\x9CEstella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this
fatal step. Put me aside for ever,--you have done so, I well know,--but
bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham
gives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done
to the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly
love you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly,
though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can bear it
better, for your sake!\xE2\x80\x9D

My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have
been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all
intelligible to her own mind.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am going,\xE2\x80\x9D she said again, in a gentler voice, \xE2\x80\x9Cto be married to
him. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be
married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by
adoption? It is my own act.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COn whom should I fling myself away?\xE2\x80\x9D she retorted, with a smile.
\xE2\x80\x9CShould I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if
people do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is
done. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading
me into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me
wait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which
has very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say no
more. We shall never understand each other.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSuch a mean brute, such a stupid brute!\xE2\x80\x9D I urged, in despair.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t be afraid of my being a blessing to him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella; \xE2\x80\x9CI shall
not be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary
boy--or man?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO Estella!\xE2\x80\x9D I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do
what I would to restrain them; \xE2\x80\x9Ceven if I remained in England and could
hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle\xE2\x80\x99s wife?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNonsense,\xE2\x80\x9D she returned,--\xE2\x80\x9Cnonsense. This will pass in no time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNever, Estella!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will get me out of your thoughts in a week.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COut of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You
have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the
rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been
in every prospect I have ever seen since,--on the river, on the sails of
the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness,
in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been
the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become
acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London buildings
are made are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your
hands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and
everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my life, you
cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good
in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I associate you only
with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you
must have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp
distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!\xE2\x80\x9D

In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself, I
don\xE2\x80\x99t know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an
inward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering
moments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,--and soon
afterwards with stronger reason,--that while Estella looked at me merely
with incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand
still covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of
pity and remorse.

All done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at
the gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when I went
in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and then
struck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time come
to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and
see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and
be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire
myself out.

It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow
intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the
Middlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was
close by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till
to-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could
get to bed myself without disturbing him.

As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the
Temple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it
ill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held the
gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory I mentioned
my name.

\xE2\x80\x9CI was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here\xE2\x80\x99s a note, sir. The
messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my
lantern?\xE2\x80\x9D

Much surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to
Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the
words, \xE2\x80\x9CPLEASE READ THIS, HERE.\xE2\x80\x9D I opened it, the watchman holding up
his light, and read inside, in Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s writing,--

\xE2\x80\x9CDON\xE2\x80\x99T GO HOME.\xE2\x80\x9D




Chapter XLV

Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made
the best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney chariot
and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed was
always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain,
letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on
his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his
list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back, with a
despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling over the
whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace
and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little
washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.

As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,
before he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those
virtuous days--an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which
instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be
lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom
of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly
wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and lay there
footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own
eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus. And thus, in the
gloom and death of the night, we stared at one another.

What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an
inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I
looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what
a number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers\xE2\x80\x99, and earwigs from the
market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying
by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever
tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,--a
disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable
approaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those
extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves
audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little
washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the
chest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired
a new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw
written, DON\xE2\x80\x99T GO HOME.

Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never warded
off this DON\xE2\x80\x99T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I thought of,
as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had read in the
newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the
night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had been
found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that he
must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to
assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door
to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship
of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But
all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,
and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were
questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed
there could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I
thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when
I recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and
tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,--even then I
was pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don\xE2\x80\x99t go home.
When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became
a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present
tense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do
not ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may not
and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should
not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over
on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again.

I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain
that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain
that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could be
taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been
so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me
from my uneasy bed.

The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o\xE2\x80\x99clock. The little
servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I
passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,
and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was
making tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded a perspective
view of the Aged in bed.

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa, Mr. Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CYou did come home, then?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I didn\xE2\x80\x99t go home.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s all right,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, rubbing his hands. \xE2\x80\x9CI left a note for you
at each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come to?\xE2\x80\x9D

I told him.

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the
notes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick; \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s a good rule never to leave documentary
evidence if you can help it, because you don\xE2\x80\x99t know when it may be put
in. I\xE2\x80\x99m going to take a liberty with you. Would you mind toasting this
sausage for the Aged P.?\xE2\x80\x9D

I said I should be delighted to do it.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen you can go about your work, Mary Anne,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick to the little
servant; \xE2\x80\x9Cwhich leaves us to ourselves, don\xE2\x80\x99t you see, Mr. Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D he
added, winking, as she disappeared.

I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse
proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged\xE2\x80\x99s sausage and he
buttered the crumb of the Aged\xE2\x80\x99s roll.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Mr. Pip, you know,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou and I understand one
another. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have been
engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official sentiments
are one thing. We are extra official.\xE2\x80\x9D

I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted
the Aged\xE2\x80\x99s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.

\xE2\x80\x9CI accidentally heard, yesterday morning,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing in a
certain place where I once took you,--even between you and me, it\xE2\x80\x99s as
well not to mention names when avoidable--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMuch better not,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CI understand you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI heard there by chance, yesterday morning,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat
a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not
unpossessed of portable property,--I don\xE2\x80\x99t know who it may really
be,--we won\xE2\x80\x99t name this person--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot necessary,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9C--Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good
many people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,
and not quite irrespective of the government expense--\xE2\x80\x9D

In watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged\xE2\x80\x99s sausage,
and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s; for which I
apologized.

\xE2\x80\x9C--By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of
thereabouts. From which,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cconjectures had been raised and
theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court,
Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBy whom?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CI wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t go into that,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, evasively, \xE2\x80\x9Cit might clash with
official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard other
curious things in the same place. I don\xE2\x80\x99t tell it you on information
received. I heard it.\xE2\x80\x9D

He took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set forth
the Aged\xE2\x80\x99s breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing it
before him, he went into the Aged\xE2\x80\x99s room with a clean white cloth, and
tied the same under the old gentleman\xE2\x80\x99s chin, and propped him up, and
put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then he
placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CAll right,
ain\xE2\x80\x99t you, Aged P.?\xE2\x80\x9D To which the cheerful Aged replied, \xE2\x80\x9CAll right,
John, my boy, all right!\xE2\x80\x9D As there seemed to be a tacit understanding
that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be
considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance
of these proceedings.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to
suspect),\xE2\x80\x9D I said to Wemmick when he came back, \xE2\x80\x9Cis inseparable from the
person to whom you have adverted; is it?\xE2\x80\x9D

Wemmick looked very serious. \xE2\x80\x9CI couldn\xE2\x80\x99t undertake to say that, of my
own knowledge. I mean, I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t undertake to say it was at first. But
it either is, or it will be, or it\xE2\x80\x99s in great danger of being.\xE2\x80\x9D

As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying
as much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out
of his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I told
him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to ask
him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he
deemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his
breakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his
notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me
once, to put my question.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is
Compeyson?\xE2\x80\x9D

He answered with one other nod.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he living?\xE2\x80\x9D

One other nod.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he in London?\xE2\x80\x9D

He gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave
me one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cquestioning being over,\xE2\x80\x9D which he emphasized and
repeated for my guidance, \xE2\x80\x9CI come to what I did, after hearing what I
heard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to
Clarriker\xE2\x80\x99s to find Mr. Herbert.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd him you found?\xE2\x80\x9D said I, with great anxiety.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any
details, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody--Tom,
Jack, or Richard--being about the chambers, or about the immediate
neighborhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way
while you were out of the way.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe would be greatly puzzled what to do?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe was puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my opinion
that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too far out
of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you something. Under existing
circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you are once
in it. Don\xE2\x80\x99t break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things slacken,
before you try the open, even for foreign air.\xE2\x80\x9D

I thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had
done?

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Herbert,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cafter being all of a heap for half an
hour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is
courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden
Pa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a
bow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You
are acquainted with the young lady, most probably?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot personally,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion
who did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to
present me to her, she had received the proposal with such very moderate
warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of
the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made
her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s prospects by
stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy: he and
his affianced, for their part, had naturally not been very anxious to
introduce a third person into their interviews; and thus, although I was
assured that I had risen in Clara\xE2\x80\x99s esteem, and although the young
lady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by
Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I did not trouble Wemmick with
these particulars.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe house with the bow-window,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing by the river-side,
down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it
seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to
let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary
tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very well of it, for
three reasons I\xE2\x80\x99ll give you. That is to say: Firstly. It\xE2\x80\x99s altogether
out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual heap of streets
great and small. Secondly. Without going near it yourself, you could
always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard, through Mr. Herbert.
Thirdly. After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should want
to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a foreign packet-boat, there he
is--ready.\xE2\x80\x9D

Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and
again, and begged him to proceed.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will, and
by nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or Richard,--whichever
it may be,--you and I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to know,--quite successfully. At the
old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to Dover, and, in
fact, he was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it. Now,
another great advantage of all this is, that it was done without you,
and when, if any one was concerning himself about your movements, you
must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged.
This diverts suspicion and confuses it; and for the same reason I
recommended that, even if you came back last night, you should not go
home. It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion.\xE2\x80\x9D

Wemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and
began to get his coat on.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd now, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, \xE2\x80\x9CI
have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,--from
a Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal
capacity,--I shall be glad to do it. Here\xE2\x80\x99s the address. There can be
no harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is
well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,--which is another
reason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone
home, don\xE2\x80\x99t go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip\xE2\x80\x9D; his
hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; \xE2\x80\x9Cand let me
finally impress one important point upon you.\xE2\x80\x9D He laid his hands upon
my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: \xE2\x80\x9CAvail yourself of this
evening to lay hold of his portable property. You don\xE2\x80\x99t know what may
happen to him. Don\xE2\x80\x99t let anything happen to the portable property.\xE2\x80\x9D

Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I
forbore to try.

\xE2\x80\x9CTime\xE2\x80\x99s up,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I must be off. If you had nothing more
pressing to do than to keep here till dark, that\xE2\x80\x99s what I should advise.
You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a perfectly
quiet day with the Aged,--he\xE2\x80\x99ll be up presently,--and a little bit
of--you remember the pig?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf course,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell; and a little bit of him. That sausage you toasted was his, and
he was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old
acquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!\xE2\x80\x9D in a cheery shout.

\xE2\x80\x9CAll right, John; all right, my boy!\xE2\x80\x9D piped the old man from within.

I soon fell asleep before Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one
another\xE2\x80\x99s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.
We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and
I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it
drowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire for
toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from his
glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was
expected.




Chapter XLVI

Eight o\xE2\x80\x99clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,
not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore
boat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-side
region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to
me; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted
was not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to
find. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks\xE2\x80\x99s Basin; and I had no other
guide to Chinks\xE2\x80\x99s Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.

It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself
among, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,
what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of ship-builders
and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground,
though for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks
and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old Green Copper. After
several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting
it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank. It was a
fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from
the river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three
trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there
was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,--whose long and narrow vista I could
trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the
ground, that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown
old and lost most of their teeth.

Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a
wooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is
another thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,
Mrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly
woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was
immediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into
the parlor and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very
familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room
and region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at
the corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the
chimney-piece, and the colored engravings on the wall, representing the
death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George the
Third in a state coachman\xE2\x80\x99s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the
terrace at Windsor.

\xE2\x80\x9CAll is well, Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cand he is quite satisfied, though
eager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you\xE2\x80\x99ll wait
till she comes down, I\xE2\x80\x99ll make you known to her, and then we\xE2\x80\x99ll go upstairs.
That\xE2\x80\x99s her father.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably
expressed the fact in my countenance.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid he is a sad old rascal,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, smiling, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I have
never seen him. Don\xE2\x80\x99t you smell rum? He is always at it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt rum?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cand you may suppose how mild it makes his
gout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his
room, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and
will weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler\xE2\x80\x99s shop.\xE2\x80\x9D

While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and
then died away.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat else can be the consequence,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, in explanation, \xE2\x80\x9Cif
he will cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand--and
everywhere else--can\xE2\x80\x99t expect to get through a Double Gloucester without
hurting himself.\xE2\x80\x9D

He seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious
roar.

\xE2\x80\x9CTo have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor of course people in general won\xE2\x80\x99t stand that noise. A
curious place, Handel; isn\xE2\x80\x99t it?\xE2\x80\x9D

It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.

\xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Whimple,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, when I told him so, \xE2\x80\x9Cis the best of
housewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without
her motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no
relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSurely that\xE2\x80\x99s not his name, Herbert?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s my name for him. His name is Mr. Barley.
But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a
girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself or anybody
else about her family!\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he
first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at
an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home
to nurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the
motherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated
with equal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that
nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by
reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject
more psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser\xE2\x80\x99s stores.

As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley\xE2\x80\x99s sustained
growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door
opened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came
in with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the
basket, and presented, blushing, as \xE2\x80\x9CClara.\xE2\x80\x9D She really was a most
charming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that
truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.

\xE2\x80\x9CLook here,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate
and tender smile, after we had talked a little; \xE2\x80\x9Chere\xE2\x80\x99s poor Clara\xE2\x80\x99s
supper, served out every night. Here\xE2\x80\x99s her allowance of bread, and
here\xE2\x80\x99s her slice of cheese, and here\xE2\x80\x99s her rum,--which I drink. This
is Mr. Barley\xE2\x80\x99s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two
mutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two
ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It\xE2\x80\x99s
stewed up together, and taken hot, and it\xE2\x80\x99s a nice thing for the gout, I
should think!\xE2\x80\x9D

There was something so natural and winning in Clara\xE2\x80\x99s resigned way of
looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and
something so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of
yielding herself to Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s embracing arm; and something so gentle in
her, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks\xE2\x80\x99s Basin,
and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the
beam,--that I would not have undone the engagement between her and
Herbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.

I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the
growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard
above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through
the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9CPapa wants
me, darling!\xE2\x80\x9D and ran away.

\xE2\x80\x9CThere is an unconscionable old shark for you!\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do
you suppose he wants now, Handel?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CSomething to drink?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s it!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary
merit. \xE2\x80\x9CHe keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.
Wait a moment, and you\xE2\x80\x99ll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There
he goes!\xE2\x80\x9D Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. \xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, \xE2\x80\x9Che\xE2\x80\x99s drinking. Now,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, \xE2\x80\x9Che\xE2\x80\x99s down again
on his back!\xE2\x80\x9D

Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to
see our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley\xE2\x80\x99s door, he was heard hoarsely
muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the
following Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something quite
the reverse:--

\xE2\x80\x9CAhoy! Bless your eyes, here\xE2\x80\x99s old Bill Barley. Here\xE2\x80\x99s old Bill Barley,
bless your eyes. Here\xE2\x80\x99s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the
Lord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,
here\xE2\x80\x99s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.\xE2\x80\x9D

In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley
would commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, while
it was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was
fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.

In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and
airy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found
Provis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to
feel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was
softened,--indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never
afterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.

The opportunity that the day\xE2\x80\x99s rest had given me for reflection had
resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting
Compeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man
might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own
destruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his
fire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s judgment
and sources of information?

\xE2\x80\x9CAy, ay, dear boy!\xE2\x80\x9D he answered, with a grave nod, \xE2\x80\x9CJaggers knows.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, I have talked with Wemmick,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cand have come to tell you
what caution he gave me and what advice.\xE2\x80\x9D

This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told
him how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or
prisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that
my chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping
close for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had
said about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time
came, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might
be safest in Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s judgment. What was to follow that I did not touch
upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my
own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in declared
peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by enlarging my
expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult
circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?

He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His
coming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a
venture. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had
very little fear of his safety with such good help.

Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said
that something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s
suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. \xE2\x80\x9CWe are both good
watermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the
right time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no
boatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance
is worth saving. Never mind the season; don\xE2\x80\x99t you think it might be a
good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and
were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into that
habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,
and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or
fifty-first.\xE2\x80\x9D

I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed
that it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never
recognize us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank. But
we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his
window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was right.

Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;
remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and
that I would take half an hour\xE2\x80\x99s start of him. \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t like to leave
you here,\xE2\x80\x9D I said to Provis, \xE2\x80\x9Cthough I cannot doubt your being safer
here than near me. Good-bye!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D he answered, clasping my hands, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know when we may
meet again, and I don\xE2\x80\x99t like good-bye. Say good night!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGood night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time
comes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, good night!\xE2\x80\x9D

We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms; and we left him
on the landing outside his door, holding a light over the stair-rail to
light us downstairs. Looking back at him, I thought of the first night
of his return, when our positions were reversed, and when I little
supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him
as it was now.

Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no
appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the
foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name of
Provis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell.
He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there was,
that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a strong
personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a secluded
life. So, when we went into the parlor where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were
seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell, but
kept it to myself.

When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of the
motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little
affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk had
grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the hills,
and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming
youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks\xE2\x80\x99s Basin to fill it to
overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and went
home very sadly.

All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The
windows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark
and still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the
fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between
me and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my
bedside when he came in,--for I went straight to bed, dispirited and
fatigued,--made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,
he looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as
solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.

Next day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat
was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach
her within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and
practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in
cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been
out a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the
hours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old
London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there
was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But I
knew well enough how to \xE2\x80\x98shoot\xE2\x80\x99 the bridge after seeing it done, and so
began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith.
The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a
pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards
the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three
times in a week, and he never brought me a single word of intelligence
that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm,
and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched. Once received,
it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I suspected of
watching me, it would be hard to calculate.

In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding.
Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at
one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to
think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Clara. But
I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that
any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going swiftly,
silently, and surely, to take him.




Chapter XLVII

Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,
and he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain, and
had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the
Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him as I
did.

My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed
for money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the
want of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve
it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But
I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more
money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and
plans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert, to
hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction--whether it
was a false kind or a true, I hardly know--in not having profited by his
generosity since his revelation of himself.

As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella
was married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a
conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had
confided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her
to me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of
hope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you
who read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last
year, last month, last week?

It was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,
towering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a
range of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause
for fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror
fresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would
with dread, for Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s returning step at night, lest it should be
fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,--for all that, and
much more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to
inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed
about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.

There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could
not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London
Bridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be
brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing
this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the
water-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings
that I have now to tell of.

One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf
at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide, and
had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had become
foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back among the
shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I had seen the
signal in his window, All well.

As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort
myself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude
before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would afterwards go
to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved his questionable
triumph was in that water-side neighborhood (it is nowhere now), and
to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that Mr. Wopsle had
not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the contrary, had rather
partaken of its decline. He had been ominously heard of, through the
play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection with a little girl of
noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen him as a predatory
Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an
outrageous hat all over bells.

I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,
where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every half-yard
of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the knives,--to
this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lord Mayor\xE2\x80\x99s
dominions which is not geographical,--and wore out the time in dozing
over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of dinners. By
and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.

There, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty\xE2\x80\x99s service,--a most
excellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so
tight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,--who knocked all
the little men\xE2\x80\x99s hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and
brave, and who wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t hear of anybody\xE2\x80\x99s paying taxes, though he was
very patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in
the cloth, and on that property married a young person in bed-furniture,
with great rejoicings; the whole population of Portsmouth (nine in
number at the last census) turning out on the beach to rub their own
hands and shake everybody else\xE2\x80\x99s, and sing \xE2\x80\x9CFill, fill!\xE2\x80\x9D A certain
dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t fill, or do anything else
that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly stated (by the
boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed to two other
Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so effectually
done (the Swab family having considerable political influence) that it
took half the evening to set things right, and then it was only brought
about through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters,
and red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and
coming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron
whom he couldn\xE2\x80\x99t confute with what he had overheard. This led to Mr.
Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s (who had never been heard of before) coming in with a star
and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the
Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot,
and that he had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack, as a slight
acknowledgment of his public services. The boatswain, unmanned for the
first time, respectfully dried his eyes on the Jack, and then cheering
up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your Honor, solicited permission to
take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle, conceding his fin with a gracious
dignity, was immediately shoved into a dusty corner, while everybody
danced a hornpipe; and from that corner, surveying the public with a
discontented eye, became aware of me.

The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in
the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected
Mr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric
countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged
in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great
cowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.
But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,
the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,--on account of
the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice
of his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a
flour-sack, out of the first-floor window,--summoned a sententious
Enchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily, after
an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a high-crowned
hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm. The business
of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at, sung at,
butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various colors,
he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with great
surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were
lost in amazement.

There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.
Wopsle\xE2\x80\x99s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his
mind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat
thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large
watch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking
of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him
waiting for me near the door.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow do you do?\xE2\x80\x9D said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the
street together. \xE2\x80\x9CI saw that you saw me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSaw you, Mr. Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D he returned. \xE2\x80\x9CYes, of course I saw you. But who else
was there?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWho else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is the strangest thing,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost
look again; \xE2\x80\x9Cand yet I could swear to him.\xE2\x80\x9D

Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, \xE2\x80\x9CI can\xE2\x80\x99t be positive;
yet I think I should.\xE2\x80\x9D

Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me
when I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.

\xE2\x80\x9COh! He can\xE2\x80\x99t be in sight,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Wopsle. \xE2\x80\x9CHe went out before I went
off. I saw him go.\xE2\x80\x9D

Having the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected
this poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission.
Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but said nothing.

\xE2\x80\x9CI had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw
that you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a
ghost.\xE2\x80\x9D

My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak
yet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on
to induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was
perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.

\xE2\x80\x9CI dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is
so very strange! You\xE2\x80\x99ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I
could hardly believe it myself, if you told me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIndeed?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day,
when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery\xE2\x80\x99s, and some soldiers
came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI remember it very well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that we
joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took the
lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI remember it all very well.\xE2\x80\x9D Better than he thought,--except the last
clause.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that
there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely
handled and much mauled about the face by the other?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI see it all before me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,
and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,
with the torchlight shining on their faces,--I am particular about
that,--with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an
outer ring of dark night all about us?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CI remember all that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I saw
him over your shoulder.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSteady!\xE2\x80\x9D I thought. I asked him then, \xE2\x80\x9CWhich of the two do you suppose
you saw?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe one who had been mauled,\xE2\x80\x9D he answered readily, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I\xE2\x80\x99ll swear I
saw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is very curious!\xE2\x80\x9D said I, with the best assumption I could put on
of its being nothing more to me. \xE2\x80\x9CVery curious indeed!\xE2\x80\x9D

I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation
threw me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson\xE2\x80\x99s
having been behind me \xE2\x80\x9Clike a ghost.\xE2\x80\x9D For if he had ever been out of my
thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was
in those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I
should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if
I had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had
found him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,
because I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger
there might be about us, danger was always near and active.

I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He
could not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.
It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify
him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me, and
known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How was
he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought, in
black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I believed
not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no especial
notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a face at all
disfigured would have attracted my attention.

When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I
extract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment,
after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was between twelve and
one o\xE2\x80\x99clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates were shut. No one
was near me when I went in and went home.

Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire. But
there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I
had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his hint.
As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to the
Castle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I went to
bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me. Herbert
and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious. And
we were very cautious indeed,--more cautious than before, if that were
possible,--and I for my part never went near Chinks\xE2\x80\x99s Basin, except
when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at
anything else.




Chapter XLVIII

The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred
about a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf
below Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and,
undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was
strolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy
concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one
overtaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s hand, and he passed it through my
arm.

\xE2\x80\x9CAs we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together. Where
are you bound for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor the Temple, I think,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t you know?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in
cross-examination, \xE2\x80\x9CI do not know, for I have not made up my mind.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are going to dine?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CYou don\xE2\x80\x99t mind admitting
that, I suppose?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t mind admitting that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd are not engaged?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t mind admitting also that I am not engaged.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThen,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Ccome and dine with me.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was going to excuse myself, when he added, \xE2\x80\x9CWemmick\xE2\x80\x99s coming.\xE2\x80\x9D So
I changed my excuse into an acceptance,--the few words I had uttered,
serving for the beginning of either,--and we went along Cheapside
and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up
brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely
finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the
afternoon\xE2\x80\x99s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,
opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at
the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.

At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,
hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the
business of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s fire, its rising
and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were
playing a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,
fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a
corner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance of
a host of hanged clients.

We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,
as soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have
thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much
as a look to Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no
objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it
was not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised
them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were
twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you send that note of Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?\xE2\x80\x9D Mr.
Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Wemmick; \xE2\x80\x9Cit was going by post, when you brought Mr.
Pip into the office. Here it is.\xE2\x80\x9D He handed it to his principal instead
of to me.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s a note of two lines, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, \xE2\x80\x9Csent
up to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your
address. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of
business you mentioned to her. You\xE2\x80\x99ll go down?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those
terms.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen do you think of going down?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have an impending engagement,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was
putting fish into the post-office, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat renders me rather uncertain of
my time. At once, I think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick to Mr.
Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Che needn\xE2\x80\x99t write an answer, you know.\xE2\x80\x9D

Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled
that I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass of wine,
and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not at me.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo, Pip! Our friend the Spider,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Chas played his
cards. He has won the pool.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was as much as I could do to assent.

\xE2\x80\x9CHah! He is a promising fellow--in his way--but he may not have it all
his own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to
be found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSurely,\xE2\x80\x9D I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou do not
seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI didn\xE2\x80\x99t say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and
beat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be
a question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance
work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such
circumstances, because it\xE2\x80\x99s a toss-up between two results.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMay I ask what they are?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA fellow like our friend the Spider,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Ceither
beats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but
he either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick his opinion.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEither beats or cringes,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself
to me.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo here\xE2\x80\x99s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, taking a decanter
of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of us and
for himself, \xE2\x80\x9Cand may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady\xE2\x80\x99s
satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman,
it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are
to-day!\xE2\x80\x9D

She was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the
table. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,
nervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers, as
she spoke, arrested my attention.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s the matter?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cwas rather
painful to me.\xE2\x80\x9D

The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood
looking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or
whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go.
Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such
hands on a memorable occasion very lately!

He dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained
before me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those
hands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I
compared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,
and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband
and a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the
housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over
me when I last walked--not alone--in the ruined garden, and through the
deserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I
saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach
window; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like
lightning, when I had passed in a carriage--not alone--through a sudden
glare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association
had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,
wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a
chance swift from Estella\xE2\x80\x99s name to the fingers with their knitting
action, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this
woman was Estella\xE2\x80\x99s mother.

Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed
the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said
the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the
wine again, and went on with his dinner.

Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the
room was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands
were Estella\xE2\x80\x99s hands, and her eyes were Estella\xE2\x80\x99s eyes, and if she had
reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less
sure that my conviction was the truth.

It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,
quite as a matter of business,--just as he might have drawn his salary
when that came round,--and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of
perpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,
his post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office
for its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong
twin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.

We took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping
among Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right
twin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down
Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was
walking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had
evaporated into the evening air.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s over! He\xE2\x80\x99s a wonderful man, without his
living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine
with him,--and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.\xE2\x80\x9D

I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.

\xE2\x80\x9CWouldn\xE2\x80\x99t say it to anybody but yourself,\xE2\x80\x9D he answered. \xE2\x80\x9CI know that
what is said between you and me goes no further.\xE2\x80\x9D

I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s adopted daughter, Mrs.
Bentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke
of the Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned
Miss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll
of the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.

\xE2\x80\x9CWemmick,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cdo you remember telling me, before I first went to
Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s private house, to notice that housekeeper?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid I?\xE2\x80\x9D he replied. \xE2\x80\x9CAh, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,\xE2\x80\x9D he added,
suddenly, \xE2\x80\x9CI know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA wild beast tamed, you called her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what do you call her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s his secret. She has been with him many a long year.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in
being acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me
goes no further.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D Wemmick replied, \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know her story,--that is, I don\xE2\x80\x99t know
all of it. But what I do know I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you. We are in our private and
personal capacities, of course.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf course.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for
murder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I
believe had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it
was up, as you may suppose.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut she was acquitted.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMr. Jaggers was for her,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning,
\xE2\x80\x9Cand worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a desperate
case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and he worked
it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to have made
him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day for many
days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial where he
couldn\xE2\x80\x99t work it himself, sat under counsel, and--every one knew--put
in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,--a woman a
good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger. It was
a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman in
Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick (as
we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy.
The murdered woman,--more a match for the man, certainly, in point of
years--was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had been a
violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched and
torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now, there
was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and
on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers
principally rested his case. You may be sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, touching me
on the sleeve, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then,
though he sometimes does now.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner
party.

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, sir!\xE2\x80\x9D Wemmick went on; \xE2\x80\x9Cit happened--happened, don\xE2\x80\x99t you
see?--that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of
her apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in
particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully
contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a bruise
or two about her,--nothing for a tramp,--but the backs of her hands
were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails? Now, Mr.
Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles
which were not as high as her face; but which she could not have got
through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles were
actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that
the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken
through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of
blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made was this:
it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that she was
under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder,
frantically destroyed her child by this man--some three years old--to
revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way: \xE2\x80\x9CWe say
these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show
you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set
up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept all
consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have
destroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have scratched
her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder of her
child; why don\xE2\x80\x99t you? As to this case, if you will have scratches,
we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them,
assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CTo
sum up, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the
jury, and they gave in.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHas she been in his service ever since?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes; but not only that,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe went into his service
immediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since been
taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was tamed
from the beginning.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you remember the sex of the child?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSaid to have been a girl.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have nothing more to say to me to-night?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

We exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for
my thoughts, though with no relief from the old.




Chapter XLIX

Putting Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s note in my pocket, that it might serve as
my credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her
waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I went
down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway House,
and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for I sought
to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it
in the same manner.

The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing
courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old monks had
once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong walls were
now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables, were almost
as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral chimes had at
once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried on avoiding
observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell of the old
organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the rooks, as they
hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the
priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was changed, and that
Estella was gone out of it for ever.

An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who
lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the
gate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,
and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was not
in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing. Looking
in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on the hearth
in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the contemplation of, the
ashy fire.

Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old
chimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There
was an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to
pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge
her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in the
progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of
that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in a low voice,
\xE2\x80\x9CIs it real?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost
no time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you. Thank you.\xE2\x80\x9D

As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I
remarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.

\xE2\x80\x9CI want,\xE2\x80\x9D she said, \xE2\x80\x9Cto pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you
were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But perhaps you
can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my heart?\xE2\x80\x9D

When I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous right
hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it again
before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do
something useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it
not?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSomething that I would like done very much.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is it?\xE2\x80\x9D

I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had
not got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking
in a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be
so; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed
that she was conscious of the fact.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you break off,\xE2\x80\x9D she asked then, with her former air of being afraid
of me, \xE2\x80\x9Cbecause you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no,\xE2\x80\x9D I answered, \xE2\x80\x9Chow can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped
because I thought you were not following what I said.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps I was not,\xE2\x80\x9D she answered, putting a hand to her head. \xE2\x80\x9CBegin
again, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.\xE2\x80\x9D

She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was
habitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of
forcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her
how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how
in this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)
involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they
were the weighty secrets of another.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo!\xE2\x80\x9D said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd how
much money is wanting to complete the purchase?\xE2\x80\x9D

I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. \xE2\x80\x9CNine
hundred pounds.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as
you have kept your own?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CQuite as faithfully.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd your mind will be more at rest?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMuch more at rest.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you very unhappy now?\xE2\x80\x9D

She asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an unwonted
tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my voice failed
me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and softly laid
her forehead on it.

\xE2\x80\x9CI am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of disquiet
than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.\xE2\x80\x9D

After a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire again.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of
unhappiness. Is it true?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CToo true.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCan I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as
done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the
tone of the question. But there is nothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

She presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room
for the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her
pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and
wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from
her neck.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CQuite. I dined with him yesterday.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your
irresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if
you would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it
to you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving
it from him.\xE2\x80\x9D

She read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and
evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the
receipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled
again, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the
pencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without
looking at me.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, \xE2\x80\x9CI
forgive her,\xE2\x80\x9D though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do
it!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO Miss Havisham,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI can do it now. There have been sore
mistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want
forgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,
and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees
at my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,
when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have
been raised to heaven from her mother\xE2\x80\x99s side.

To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet
gave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got
my arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of mine
which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and wept. I
had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that the
relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was not
kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.

\xE2\x80\x9CO!\xE2\x80\x9D she cried, despairingly. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat have I done! What have I done!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me
answer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances. Is
she married?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house
had told me so.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat have I done! What have I done!\xE2\x80\x9D She wrung her hands, and crushed
her white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat have
I done!\xE2\x80\x9D

I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a
grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form
that her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found
vengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light
of day, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had
secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,
her mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and
must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew
equally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her
punishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this earth
on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become a
master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse, the
vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been
curses in this world?

\xE2\x80\x9CUntil you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a
looking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know
what I had done. What have I done! What have I done!\xE2\x80\x9D And so again,
twenty, fifty times over, What had she done!

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham,\xE2\x80\x9D I said, when her cry had died away, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou may dismiss me
from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and if
you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a
part of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that
than to bemoan the past through a hundred years.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, yes, I know it. But, Pip--my dear!\xE2\x80\x9D There was an earnest womanly
compassion for me in her new affection. \xE2\x80\x9CMy dear! Believe this: when she
first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At first,
I meant no more.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, well!\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CI hope so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did
worse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,
and with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and
point my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBetter,\xE2\x80\x9D I could not help saying, \xE2\x80\x9Cto have left her a natural heart,
even to be bruised or broken.\xE2\x80\x9D

With that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and then
burst out again, What had she done!

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you knew all my story,\xE2\x80\x9D she pleaded, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou would have some compassion
for me and a better understanding of me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham,\xE2\x80\x9D I answered, as delicately as I could, \xE2\x80\x9CI believe I may
say that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first left
this neighborhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration, and I
hope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed between us
give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to Estella? Not as
she is, but as she was when she first came here?\xE2\x80\x9D

She was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and
her head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and
replied, \xE2\x80\x9CGo on.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhose child was Estella?\xE2\x80\x9D

She shook her head.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou don\xE2\x80\x99t know?\xE2\x80\x9D

She shook her head again.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBrought her here.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWill you tell me how that came about?\xE2\x80\x9D

She answered in a low whisper and with caution: \xE2\x80\x9CI had been shut up in
these rooms a long time (I don\xE2\x80\x99t know how long; you know what time the
clocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear
and love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent
for him to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the
newspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would
look about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here
asleep, and I called her Estella.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMight I ask her age then?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTwo or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an
orphan and I adopted her.\xE2\x80\x9D

So convinced I was of that woman\xE2\x80\x99s being her mother, that I wanted
no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I
thought, the connection here was clear and straight.

What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had
succeeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew
of Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No matter
with what other words we parted; we parted.

Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I
called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I would
not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before leaving.
For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again, and I felt
that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.

By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which
the rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and
leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on
end, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by
the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the paths
where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary all!

Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little
door at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at the
opposite door,--not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started and
swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was encumbered
with a growth of fungus,--when I turned my head to look back. A childish
association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight
action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam. So
strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam shuddering from
head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,--though to be sure I was
there in an instant.

The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of
this illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an
indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I
had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on into
the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out
at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go upstairs
and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I had left
her. I took the latter course and went up.

I looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in the
ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back towards
me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away,
I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw her
running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about her,
and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.

I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.
That I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over
her; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose,
and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and
all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the ground
struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered her,
the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,--that this
occurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or
thought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the
floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were
floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded
bridal dress.

Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running
away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries
at the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like
a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or
why we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the flames
were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments
no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.

She was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even
touched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if
I unreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire
would break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon\xE2\x80\x99s
coming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my hands
were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling.

On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,
but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay
mainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon\xE2\x80\x99s directions, her bed was
carried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to
be well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again, an
hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her stick,
and had heard her say that she would lie one day.

Though every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she
still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had
covered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with
a white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that
had been and was changed was still upon her.

I found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I
got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the
next post. Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s family I took upon myself; intending to
communicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he
liked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert, as
soon as I returned to town.

There was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had
happened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she
began to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that
she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat have I done!\xE2\x80\x9D
 And then, \xE2\x80\x9CWhen she first came, I meant to save her from misery like
mine.\xE2\x80\x9D And then, \xE2\x80\x9CTake the pencil and write under my name, \xE2\x80\x98I forgive
her!\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she
sometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in
another word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.

As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that pressing
reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive
out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I would
return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and being
taken up clear of the town. At about six o\xE2\x80\x99clock of the morning,
therefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as
they said, not stopping for being touched, \xE2\x80\x9CTake the pencil and write
under my name, \xE2\x80\x98I forgive her.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D




Chapter L

My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in
the morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less
severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames
had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My right
hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It was
bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and
arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a
cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had
been caught by the fire, but not my head or face.

When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he came
back to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. He
was the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,
and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put them
on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for.

At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I
might say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the
flames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I
dozed for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s cries, and by her
running at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain
of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I
suffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention
engaged.

Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That
was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our
agreeing--without agreement--to make my recovery of the use of my hands
a question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.

My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all
was well down the river? As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect
confidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the day
was wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more by
the light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it
spontaneously.

\xE2\x80\x9CI sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere was Clara?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDear little thing!\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert. \xE2\x80\x9CShe was up and down with
Gruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the floor
the moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long, though.
What with rum and pepper,--and pepper and rum,--I should think his
pegging must be nearly over.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd then you will be married, Herbert?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHow can I take care of the dear child otherwise?--Lay your arm out upon
the back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I\xE2\x80\x99ll sit down here, and get the
bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I was
speaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night, and
told me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here about some
woman that he had had great trouble with.--Did I hurt you?\xE2\x80\x9D

I had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a start.

\xE2\x80\x9CI had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.
Shall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTell me by all means. Every word.\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been
rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for. \xE2\x80\x9CYour
head is cool?\xE2\x80\x9D he said, touching it.

\xE2\x80\x9CQuite,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CTell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt seems,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9C--there\xE2\x80\x99s a bandage off most charmingly, and
now comes the cool one,--makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,
don\xE2\x80\x99t it? but it will be comfortable presently,--it seems that the
woman was a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;
revengeful, Handel, to the last degree.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTo what last degree?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMurder.--Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended
her, and the reputation of that defence first made his name known
to Provis. It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim,
and there had been a struggle--in a barn. Who began it, or how fair
it was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended is
certainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWas the woman brought in guilty?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo; she was acquitted.--My poor Handel, I hurt you!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThis acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little
child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very
night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the
young woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore
that she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he
should never see it again; then she vanished.--There\xE2\x80\x99s the worst arm
comfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right
hand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light
than by a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don\xE2\x80\x99t see the poor
blistered patches too distinctly.--You don\xE2\x80\x99t think your breathing is
affected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere comes the darkest part of Provis\xE2\x80\x99s life. She did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat is, he says she did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, of course, my dear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,
and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. \xE2\x80\x9CHe says it all. I
have no other information.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, to be sure.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, whether,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Che had used the child\xE2\x80\x99s mother ill, or
whether he had used the child\xE2\x80\x99s mother well, Provis doesn\xE2\x80\x99t say; but she
had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described
to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for her, and
forbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be called upon to
depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause of her death, he
hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept himself dark, as he
says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was only vaguely talked
of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the jealousy arose. After
the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost the child and the
child\xE2\x80\x99s mother.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI want to ask--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA moment, my dear boy, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson,
the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keeping
out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so, of course
afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him
poorer and working him harder. It was clear last night that this barbed
the point of Provis\xE2\x80\x99s animosity.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI want to know,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cand particularly, Herbert, whether he told
you when this happened?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CParticularly? Let me remember, then, what he said as to that. His
expression was, \xE2\x80\x98a round score o\xE2\x80\x99 year ago, and a\xE2\x80\x99most directly after I
took up wi\xE2\x80\x99 Compeyson.\xE2\x80\x99 How old were you when you came upon him in the
little churchyard?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think in my seventh year.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAy. It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you
brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would have
been about your age.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHerbert,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, \xE2\x80\x9Ccan you see
me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBy the firelight,\xE2\x80\x9D answered Herbert, coming close again.

\xE2\x80\x9CLook at me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do look at you, my dear boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTouch me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do touch you, my dear boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much
disordered by the accident of last night?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CN-no, my dear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, after taking time to examine me. \xE2\x80\x9CYou
are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down the river,
is Estella\xE2\x80\x99s Father.\xE2\x80\x9D




Chapter LI

What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving
Estella\xE2\x80\x99s parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the
question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before
me by a wiser head than my own.

But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized
with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down,--that I
ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers, and come
at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I felt that I did this
for Estella\xE2\x80\x99s sake, or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in
whose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic
interest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps the latter possibility
may be the nearer to the truth.

Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street
that night. Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s representations that, if I did, I should probably
be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive\xE2\x80\x99s safety would depend
upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding, again
and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr. Jaggers
to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts
looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out
together, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left
Herbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.

There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over
the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things
straight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr.
Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer
office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s post that morning, I knew
what was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick
together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to
compromise him.

My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders,
favored my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief account of
the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him all
the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk
to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of
evidence, than it had been before. While I described the disaster, Mr.
Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire. Wemmick leaned
back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the pockets of his
trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post. The two brutal
casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings,
seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn\xE2\x80\x99t smell fire at
the present moment.

My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced
Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for
Herbert. Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when
I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,
with instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was
in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.
Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked
on at me. \xE2\x80\x9CI am sorry, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, as I put the check in my pocket,
when he had signed it, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat we do nothing for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Havisham was good enough to ask me,\xE2\x80\x9D I returned, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhether she
could do nothing for me, and I told her No.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEverybody should know his own business,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw
Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s lips form the words \xE2\x80\x9Cportable property.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI should not have told her No, if I had been you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr Jaggers;
\xE2\x80\x9Cbut every man ought to know his own business best.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CEvery man\xE2\x80\x99s business,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,
\xE2\x80\x9Cis portable property.\xE2\x80\x9D

As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at
heart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:--

\xE2\x80\x9CI did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to give
me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave me
all she possessed.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid she?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and
then straightening himself. \xE2\x80\x9CHah! I don\xE2\x80\x99t think I should have done so,
if I had been Miss Havisham. But she ought to know her own business
best.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know more of the history of Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s adopted child than Miss
Havisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated \xE2\x80\x9CMother?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have seen her mother within these three days.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CPerhaps I know more of Estella\xE2\x80\x99s history than even you do,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CI
know her father too.\xE2\x80\x9D

A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner--he was too
self-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being
brought to an indefinably attentive stop--assured me that he did not
know who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis\xE2\x80\x99s
account (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;
which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s
client until some four years later, and when he could have no reason for
claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this unconsciousness
on Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s part before, though I was quite sure of it now.

\xE2\x80\x9CSo! You know the young lady\xE2\x80\x99s father, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D I replied, \xE2\x80\x9Cand his name is Provis--from New South Wales.\xE2\x80\x9D

Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest
start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the
sooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the
action of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the
announcement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just
then, lest Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s sharpness should detect that there had been
some communication unknown to him between us.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd on what evidence, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he
paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, \xE2\x80\x9Cdoes Provis make
this claim?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHe does not make it,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cand has never made it, and has no
knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.\xE2\x80\x9D

For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so
unexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket
without completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked
with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.

Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation
that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact
knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look
towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for
some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s look. When I did at last turn
my eyes in Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s direction, I found that he had unposted his pen,
and was intent upon the table before him.

\xE2\x80\x9CHah!\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the
table. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?\xE2\x80\x9D

But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a
passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and
manly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had
lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had
made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I
represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from
him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said that
I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted
assurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,
and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he
cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,
and that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,
whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything
else in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and
silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to
Wemmick, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CWemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle
heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the
innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business
life. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to
represent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be more
open with me!\xE2\x80\x9D

I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.
Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving
crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his
employment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like
a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat\xE2\x80\x99s all this?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers. \xE2\x80\x9CYou with an old father, and you
with pleasant and playful ways?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell!\xE2\x80\x9D returned Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CIf I don\xE2\x80\x99t bring \xE2\x80\x98em here, what does it
matter?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling
openly, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot a bit of it,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. \xE2\x80\x9CI think
you\xE2\x80\x99re another.\xE2\x80\x9D

Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still
distrustful that the other was taking him in.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou with a pleasant home?\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers.

\xE2\x80\x9CSince it don\xE2\x80\x99t interfere with business,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Clet it be
so. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t wonder if you might be planning
and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days,
when you\xE2\x80\x99re tired of all this work.\xE2\x80\x9D

Mr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and
actually drew a sigh. \xE2\x80\x9CPip,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cwe won\xE2\x80\x99t talk about \xE2\x80\x98poor
dreams;\xE2\x80\x99 you know more about such things than I, having much fresher
experience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I\xE2\x80\x99ll put a
case to you. Mind! I admit nothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly
said that he admitted nothing.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, \xE2\x80\x9Cput this case. Put the case that a
woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child
concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser,
on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to the
latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put the
case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an
eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI follow you, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPut the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he
saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain
destruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at
a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that
he habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,
neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing
up to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw
in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much
spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,--to be
prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI follow you, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPut the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the
heap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make
no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this
power: \xE2\x80\x9CI know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so, you
did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you through
it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it should
be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced.
Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring you off. If
you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost, your child is
still saved.\xE2\x80\x9D Put the case that this was done, and that the woman was
cleared.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI understand you perfectly.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut that I make no admissions?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat you make no admissions.\xE2\x80\x9D And Wemmick repeated, \xE2\x80\x9CNo admissions.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPut the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little
shaken the woman\xE2\x80\x99s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,
she was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be
sheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the
old, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking
out, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend
the imaginary case?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CQuite.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPut the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That
the mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the
mother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many
miles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was
still a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case
to yourself very carefully.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully.\xE2\x80\x9D

And Wemmick said, \xE2\x80\x9CI do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father\xE2\x80\x99s? I think
he would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother\xE2\x80\x99s? I
think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was.
For the daughter\xE2\x80\x99s? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her
parentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to
disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for
life. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her the
subject of those \xE2\x80\x98poor dreams\xE2\x80\x99 which have, at one time or another, been
in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you that you
had better--and would much sooner when you had thought well of it--chop
off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand, and
then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut that off too.\xE2\x80\x9D

I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his
lips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.
\xE2\x80\x9CNow, Wemmick,\xE2\x80\x9D said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat
item was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?\xE2\x80\x9D

Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the
odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with
this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say
conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to
the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one
another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately
justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for
a moment. I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they
got on very well indeed together.

But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike,
the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his
sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within
those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or in that
of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble (which in
that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest daughter
was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this melancholy
circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the
fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike\xE2\x80\x99s eye happened to
twinkle with a tear.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat are you about?\xE2\x80\x9D demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.
\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you come snivelling here for?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI didn\xE2\x80\x99t go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou did,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CHow dare you? You\xE2\x80\x99re not in a fit state to
come here, if you can\xE2\x80\x99t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.
What do you mean by it?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA man can\xE2\x80\x99t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,\xE2\x80\x9D pleaded Mike.

\xE2\x80\x9CHis what?\xE2\x80\x9D demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. \xE2\x80\x9CSay that again!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNow look here my man,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing
to the door. \xE2\x80\x9CGet out of this office. I\xE2\x80\x99ll have no feelings here. Get
out.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt serves you right,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9CGet out.\xE2\x80\x9D

So, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and
Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and
went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had
just had lunch.




Chapter LII


From Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss
Skiffins\xE2\x80\x99s brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins\xE2\x80\x99s brother, the
accountant, going straight to Clarriker\xE2\x80\x99s and bringing Clarriker to me,
I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was the
only good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,
since I was first apprised of my great expectations.

Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House
were steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a
small branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension
of the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would
go out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for
a separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more
settled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its
hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.

But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home
of a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he told
me no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara
Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join
them (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up the
Nile and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part in
those bright plans, I felt that Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s way was clearing fast, and
that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his
daughter would soon be happily provided for.

We had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it presented
no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal that I
was still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably restored;
disfigured, but fairly serviceable.

On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received
the following letter from Wemmick by the post.

\xE2\x80\x9CWalworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say
Wednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try
it. Now burn.\xE2\x80\x9D

When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire--but not
before we had both got it by heart--we considered what to do. For, of
course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have thought it over again and again,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I think I
know a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A good
fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and honorable.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had thought of him more than once.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut how much would you tell him, Herbert?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere
freak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know that
there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away. You go
with him?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo doubt.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhere?\xE2\x80\x9D

It had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the
point, almost indifferent what port we made for,--Hamburg, Rotterdam,
Antwerp,--the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any
foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do.
I had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the
boat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for
search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would
leave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get
down the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot
until we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we
lay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we
made inquiries beforehand.

Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after
breakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for
Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our
thoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign
steamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied
ourselves that we knew the build and color of each. We then separated
for a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;
Herbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do
without any hindrance, and when we met again at one o\xE2\x80\x99clock reported
it done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen
Startop, and he was more than ready to join.

Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer; our
charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our object, we
should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not come home to
dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that he should
not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he should prepare
Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on Wednesday, when
he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the arrangements with
him should be concluded that Monday night; and that he should be
communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on board.

These precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.

On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter
in the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not ill-written.
It had been delivered by hand (of course, since I left home), and its
contents were these:--

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow
night at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,
you had better come. If you want information regarding your uncle
Provis, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time. You
must come alone. Bring this with you.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange
letter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I must
decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would take
me down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of
going, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And again,
for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some important
bearing on the flight itself.

If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still have
gone. Having hardly any time for consideration,--my watch showing me
that the coach started within half an hour,--I resolved to go. I should
certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle Provis. That,
coming on Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s letter and the morning\xE2\x80\x99s busy preparation, turned
the scale.

It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost
any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this mysterious
epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be secret got
mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of
way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him that as I should
be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry
down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring.
I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock up the chambers,
and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If I had taken a
hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have missed my aim;
going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard. I
was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in straw, when I
came to myself.

For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had
so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning hurry
and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had waited for
Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now I began
to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt whether I had
sufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should
get out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an
anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases
of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried
people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered
everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it,--if
that be reasoning,--in case any harm should befall him through my not
going, how could I ever forgive myself!

It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary
to me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside
in my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of
minor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was
preparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she was
still very ill, though considered something better.

My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I
dined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able
to cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for
me. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain
me with my own story,--of course with the popular feature that
Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know the young man?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CKnow him!\xE2\x80\x9D repeated the landlord. \xE2\x80\x9CEver since he was--no height at
all.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDoes he ever come back to this neighborhood?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAy, he comes back,\xE2\x80\x9D said the landlord, \xE2\x80\x9Cto his great friends, now and
again, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat man is that?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHim that I speak of,\xE2\x80\x9D said the landlord. \xE2\x80\x9CMr. Pumblechook.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he ungrateful to no one else?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo doubt he would be, if he could,\xE2\x80\x9D returned the landlord, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut he
can\xE2\x80\x99t. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDoes Pumblechook say so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSay so!\xE2\x80\x9D replied the landlord. \xE2\x80\x9CHe han\xE2\x80\x99t no call to say so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut does he say so?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt would turn a man\xE2\x80\x99s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of
it, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said the landlord.

I thought, \xE2\x80\x9CYet Joe, dear Joe, you never tell of it. Long-suffering and
loving Joe, you never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYour appetite\xE2\x80\x99s been touched like by your accident,\xE2\x80\x9D said the landlord,
glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. \xE2\x80\x9CTry a tenderer bit.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, thank you,\xE2\x80\x9D I replied, turning from the table to brood over the
fire. \xE2\x80\x9CI can eat no more. Please take it away.\xE2\x80\x9D

I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as
through the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;
the meaner he, the nobler Joe.

My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire
for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not from
my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened round
my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for the
letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it, and
was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of
the coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the
little sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.
Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.




Chapter LIII

It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed
lands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there was
a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon.
In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in among the
piled mountains of cloud.

There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A
stranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were
so oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew
them well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had
no excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my
inclination, I went on against it.

The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor
that in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards
the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights
away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew the
limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart;
so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night, there
would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright
specks.

At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand
still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose
and blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while I
seemed to have the whole flats to myself.

It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was
burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and
left, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It
lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the
tools and barrows that were lying about.

Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,--for the rude
path lay through it,--I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened
my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,
I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and
how the house--of wood with a tiled roof--would not be proof against the
weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze
were coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a
ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I knocked again.
No answer still, and I tried the latch.

It rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a lighted
candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead. As
there was a loft above, I called, \xE2\x80\x9CIs there any one here?\xE2\x80\x9D but no voice
answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine,
called again, \xE2\x80\x9CIs there any one here?\xE2\x80\x9D There being still no answer, I
went out at the door, irresolute what to do.

It was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen
already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the shelter
of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was considering that
some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or
the candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the
wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in
my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock; and the next
thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in a strong running
noose, thrown over my head from behind.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said a suppressed voice with an oath, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve got you!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is this?\xE2\x80\x9D I cried, struggling. \xE2\x80\x9CWho is it? Help, help, help!\xE2\x80\x9D

Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on
my bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man\xE2\x80\x99s hand,
sometimes a strong man\xE2\x80\x99s breast, was set against my mouth to deaden
my cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled
ineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd
now,\xE2\x80\x9D said the suppressed voice with another oath, \xE2\x80\x9Ccall out again, and
I\xE2\x80\x99ll make short work of you!\xE2\x80\x9D

Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the
surprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in
execution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.
But, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt
before, it were now being boiled.

The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black
darkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.
After groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he
wanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the sparks
that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and breathed,
match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue point of
the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,--no wonder
there,--and one after another the sparks died out.

The man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As
the sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and
touches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending
over the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,
breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and
showed me Orlick.

Whom I had looked for, I don\xE2\x80\x99t know. I had not looked for him. Seeing
him, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes
upon him.

He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,
and dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away from
him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms folded
on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to a stout
perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,--a fixture there,--the
means of ascent to the loft above.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ve
got you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CUnbind me. Let me go!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99ll let you go. I\xE2\x80\x99ll let you go to the moon, I\xE2\x80\x99ll
let you go to the stars. All in good time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy have you lured me here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t you know?\xE2\x80\x9D said he, with a deadly look.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy have you set upon me in the dark?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBecause I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than two.
O you enemy, you enemy!\xE2\x80\x9D

His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms
folded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a
malignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence,
he put his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a
brass-bound stock.

\xE2\x80\x9CDo you know this?\xE2\x80\x9D said he, making as if he would take aim at me. \xE2\x80\x9CDo
you know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes,\xE2\x80\x9D I answered.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou cost me that place. You did. Speak!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat else could I do?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to
come betwixt me and a young woman I liked?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen did I?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen didn\xE2\x80\x99t you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to
her.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done
you no harm, if you had done yourself none.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re a liar. And you\xE2\x80\x99ll take any pains, and spend any money, to drive
me out of this country, will you?\xE2\x80\x9D said he, repeating my words to Biddy
in the last interview I had with her. \xE2\x80\x9CNow, I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you a piece of
information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this
country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty times
told, to the last brass farden!\xE2\x80\x9D As he shook his heavy hand at me, with
his mouth snarling like a tiger\xE2\x80\x99s, I felt that it was true.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat are you going to do to me?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m a going,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a
heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,--\xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m
a going to have your life!\xE2\x80\x9D

He leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it
across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou was always in Old Orlick\xE2\x80\x99s way since ever you was a child. You goes
out of his way this present night. He\xE2\x80\x99ll have no more on you. You\xE2\x80\x99re
dead.\xE2\x80\x9D

I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked
wildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.

\xE2\x80\x9CMore than that,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, folding his arms on the table again, \xE2\x80\x9CI won\xE2\x80\x99t
have a rag of you, I won\xE2\x80\x99t have a bone of you, left on earth. I\xE2\x80\x99ll put
your body in the kiln,--I\xE2\x80\x99d carry two such to it, on my Shoulders,--and,
let people suppose what they may of you, they shall never know nothing.\xE2\x80\x9D

My mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences
of such a death. Estella\xE2\x80\x99s father would believe I had deserted him,
would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,
when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had
called at Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would
never know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what
I had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed
through. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible
than death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And
so quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn
generations,--Estella\xE2\x80\x99s children, and their children,--while the
wretch\xE2\x80\x99s words were yet on his lips.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow, wolf,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cafore I kill you like any other beast,--which is
wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,--I\xE2\x80\x99ll have a good look
at you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!\xE2\x80\x9D

It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though
few could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the
hopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by
a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I
resolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some
last poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of
men were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of
Heaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no
farewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to
me, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my
miserable errors,--still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I
would have done it.

He had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his
neck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink
slung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and
took a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw
flash into his face.

\xE2\x80\x9CWolf!\xE2\x80\x9D said he, folding his arms again, \xE2\x80\x9COld Orlick\xE2\x80\x99s a going to tell
you somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.\xE2\x80\x9D

Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the
whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her death,
before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.

\xE2\x80\x9CIt was you, villain,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CI tell you it was your doing,--I tell you it was done through you,\xE2\x80\x9D he
retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the
vacant air between us. \xE2\x80\x9CI come upon her from behind, as I come upon you
to-night. I giv\xE2\x80\x99 it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a
limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have come
to life again. But it warn\xE2\x80\x99t Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was
favored, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?
Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.\xE2\x80\x9D

He drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of
the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly
understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an
end of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew
that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards
me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he would do
as he had done in my sister\xE2\x80\x99s case,--make all haste to the town, and
be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My rapid mind
pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with him in it,
and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white
vapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.

It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years
while he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented pictures
to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of my brain,
I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons without
seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of these
images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him himself,--who
would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!--that I knew of
the slightest action of his fingers.

When he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which
he sat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,
shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me, stood
before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.

\xE2\x80\x9CWolf, I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled
over on your stairs that night.\xE2\x80\x9D

I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of
the heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman\xE2\x80\x99s lantern on the wall.
I saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;
there, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd why was Old Orlick there? I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you something more, wolf.
You and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as
getting a easy living in it goes, and I\xE2\x80\x99ve took up with new companions,
and new masters. Some of \xE2\x80\x98em writes my letters when I wants \xE2\x80\x98em
wrote,--do you mind?--writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;
they\xE2\x80\x99re not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I\xE2\x80\x99ve had a firm mind
and a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your
sister\xE2\x80\x99s burying. I han\xE2\x80\x99t seen a way to get you safe, and I\xE2\x80\x99ve looked
arter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,
\xE2\x80\x98Somehow or another I\xE2\x80\x99ll have him!\xE2\x80\x99 What! When I looks for you, I finds
your uncle Provis, eh?\xE2\x80\x9D

Mill Pond Bank, and Chinks\xE2\x80\x99s Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,
all so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was
over, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his
back, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running
out to sea!

\xE2\x80\x9CYou with a uncle too! Why, I know\xE2\x80\x99d you at Gargery\xE2\x80\x99s when you was so
small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and
thumb and chucked you away dead (as I\xE2\x80\x99d thoughts o\xE2\x80\x99 doing, odd times,
when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you
hadn\xE2\x80\x99t found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for
to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old
Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year
ago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like
a bullock, as he means to drop you--hey?--when he come for to hear
that--hey?\xE2\x80\x9D

In his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I
turned my face aside to save it from the flame.

\xE2\x80\x9CAh!\xE2\x80\x9D he cried, laughing, after doing it again, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe burnt child dreads
the fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was
smuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick\xE2\x80\x99s a match for you and
know\xE2\x80\x99d you\xE2\x80\x99d come to-night! Now I\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you something more, wolf, and
this ends it. There\xE2\x80\x99s them that\xE2\x80\x99s as good a match for your uncle Provis
as Old Orlick has been for you. Let him \xE2\x80\x98ware them, when he\xE2\x80\x99s lost his
nevvy! Let him \xE2\x80\x98ware them, when no man can\xE2\x80\x99t find a rag of his dear
relation\xE2\x80\x99s clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There\xE2\x80\x99s them that can\xE2\x80\x99t
and that won\xE2\x80\x99t have Magwitch,--yes, I know the name!--alive in the same
land with them, and that\xE2\x80\x99s had such sure information of him when he
was alive in another land, as that he couldn\xE2\x80\x99t and shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t leave it
unbeknown and put them in danger. P\xE2\x80\x99raps it\xE2\x80\x99s them that writes fifty
hands, and that\xE2\x80\x99s not like sneaking you as writes but one. \xE2\x80\x98Ware
Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!\xE2\x80\x9D

He flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an
instant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the
light on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and
Biddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.

There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite
wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and forwards. His
great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before, as he
did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides, and with
his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left. Wild as my inward
hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me
instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that, unless he had
resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all
human knowledge, he would never have told me what he had told.

Of a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed
it away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed
slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked at
me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his
hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing
horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw in his
hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.

The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering
one vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and
struggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I
could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until
then unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard responsive
shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door, heard
voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men, as if
it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out into the
night.

After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the
same place, with my head on some one\xE2\x80\x99s knee. My eyes were fixed on the
ladder against the wall, when I came to myself,--had opened on it before
my mind saw it,--and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I
was in the place where I had lost it.

Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who supported
me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came between me and it
a face. The face of Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy!

\xE2\x80\x9CI think he\xE2\x80\x99s all right!\xE2\x80\x9D said Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy, in a sober voice; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut ain\xE2\x80\x99t
he just pale though!\xE2\x80\x9D

At these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,
and I saw my supporter to be--

\xE2\x80\x9CHerbert! Great Heaven!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSoftly,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert. \xE2\x80\x9CGently, Handel. Don\xE2\x80\x99t be too eager.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd our old comrade, Startop!\xE2\x80\x9D I cried, as he too bent over me.

\xE2\x80\x9CRemember what he is going to assist us in,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cand be
calm.\xE2\x80\x9D

The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain
in my arm. \xE2\x80\x9CThe time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is
to-night? How long have I been here?\xE2\x80\x9D For, I had a strange and
strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time--a day and a
night,--two days and nights,--more.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank God!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert. \xE2\x80\x9CBut
you can\xE2\x80\x99t help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can you
stand?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, yes,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing
arm.\xE2\x80\x9D

They laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen and
inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they tore
up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced
it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling
lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the door of the
dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the quarry on our
way back. Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy--Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s overgrown young man now--went before us
with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come in at the door. But,
the moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky,
and the night, though rainy, was much lighter. The white vapor of the
kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as I had thought a prayer
before, I thought a thanksgiving now.

Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,--which at
first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining
quiet,--I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our
chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had
met in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I
was gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the
inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His
uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an
hour\xE2\x80\x99s consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who
volunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went
down. Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his
uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he
resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the
Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,
finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s, where they lost me.
Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when
I was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh
themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes. Among
the loungers under the Boar\xE2\x80\x99s archway happened to be Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s Boy,--true
to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no
business,--and Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham\xE2\x80\x99s in
the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy became their guide,
and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by the town way
to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went along, Herbert
reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some
genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis\xE2\x80\x99s safety, and,
bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous,
left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on by
himself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to
ascertain whether all was right within. As he could hear nothing but
indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was while my mind was so
busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly
I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries, and rushed in, closely
followed by the other two.

When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our
immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it
was, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such
a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might
be fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we
relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the
present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather
light of the matter to Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy; who, I am convinced, would have been
much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his intervention
saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb\xE2\x80\x99s boy was of a malignant
nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in his
constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody\xE2\x80\x99s expense. When
we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed to meet his
views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of
him (which made no impression on him at all).

Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London
that night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be
clear away before the night\xE2\x80\x99s adventure began to be talked of. Herbert
got a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this stuff
dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear its pain
on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple, and I went
at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.

My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for
to-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of
itself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the
mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon
me that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with such
consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.

No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining
from communication with him that day; yet this again increased my
restlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing
that he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell
me so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was
something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the fact
had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days wore
on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,
my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow
morning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning
head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to
high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew
in prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a
fatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to
myself with a start, \xE2\x80\x9CNow it has come, and I am turning delirious!\xE2\x80\x9D

They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed, and
gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the notion
I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and the
opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed
and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for
four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last
self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept
soundly.

Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking
lights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a
marsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was
spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray, with here and there
at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along
the clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the
unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from
the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters. From me
too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.

Herbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on
the sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the fire,
which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In good
time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the sharp
morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still
flowing towards us.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhen it turns at nine o\xE2\x80\x99clock,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, cheerfully, \xE2\x80\x9Clook out for
us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!\xE2\x80\x9D




Chapter LIV

It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind
blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.
We had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly
possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the
bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were
questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for
it was wholly set on Provis\xE2\x80\x99s safety. I only wondered for the passing
moment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered
circumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.

We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if
we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had
taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After
a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two
or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went
on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then about
high-water,--half-past eight.

Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being
with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,
and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long
reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is
broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and
where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we could
choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all night.
The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from
London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at what time
to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail the first;
so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we should have
another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.

The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose
was so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in
which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the
movement on the river, and the moving river itself,--the road that ran
with us, seeming to sympathize with us, animate us, and encourage us
on,--freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use
in the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends, and
they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.

At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present
extent, and watermen\xE2\x80\x99s boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing
colliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now;
but of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part
so many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and
there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;
the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a much
easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and we
went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.

Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its
oyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor\xE2\x80\x99s Gate, and
we were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,
and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking immensely
high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were colliers by the
score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off stages on deck, as
counterweights to measures of coal swinging up, which were then rattled
over the side into barges; here, at her moorings was to-morrow\xE2\x80\x99s steamer
for Rotterdam, of which we took good notice; and here to-morrow\xE2\x80\x99s for
Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we crossed. And now I, sitting in the
stern, could see, with a faster beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill
Pond stairs.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs he there?\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot yet.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CRight! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his signal?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot well from here; but I think I see it.--Now I see him! Pull both.
Easy, Herbert. Oars!\xE2\x80\x9D

We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,
and we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas
bag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear boy!\xE2\x80\x9D he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took his
seat. \xE2\x80\x9CFaithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!\xE2\x80\x9D

Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty
chain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the
moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood
and shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the
figure-head of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds (as
is done by many Johns), and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality
of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head; in
and out, hammers going in ship-builders\xE2\x80\x99 yards, saws going at timber,
clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky ships,
capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible sea-creatures
roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen, in and
out,--out at last upon the clearer river, where the ships\xE2\x80\x99 boys might
take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled waters with them
over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind.

At the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had
looked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We
certainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not either
attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by any boat,
I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on, or to
make her purpose evident. But we held our own without any appearance of
molestation.

He had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural part
of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he had
led accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us. He
was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his
gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not
disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no
notion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted
it, but it must come before he troubled himself.

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you knowed, dear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D he said to me, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat it is to sit here
alonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day
betwixt four walls, you\xE2\x80\x99d envy me. But you don\xE2\x80\x99t know what it is.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think I know the delights of freedom,\xE2\x80\x9D I answered.

\xE2\x80\x9CAh,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, shaking his head gravely. \xE2\x80\x9CBut you don\xE2\x80\x99t know it equal to
me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it equal to
me,--but I ain\xE2\x80\x99t a going to be low.\xE2\x80\x9D

It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he
should have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected
that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the
habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I
was not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:--

\xE2\x80\x9CYou see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t\xE2\x80\x99other side the world, I
was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for
all I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could
come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody\xE2\x80\x99s head would be troubled about
him. They ain\xE2\x80\x99t so easy concerning me here, dear boy,--wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be,
leastwise, if they knowed where I was.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf all goes well,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou will be perfectly free and safe again
within a few hours.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell,\xE2\x80\x9D he returned, drawing a long breath, \xE2\x80\x9CI hope so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd think so?\xE2\x80\x9D

He dipped his hand in the water over the boat\xE2\x80\x99s gunwale, and said,
smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:--

\xE2\x80\x9CAy, I s\xE2\x80\x99pose I think so, dear boy. We\xE2\x80\x99d be puzzled to be more quiet
and easy-going than we are at present. But--it\xE2\x80\x99s a flowing so soft
and pleasant through the water, p\xE2\x80\x99raps, as makes me think it--I was
a thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the
bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river
what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can\xE2\x80\x99t no more hold their tide than
I can hold this. And it\xE2\x80\x99s run through my fingers and gone, you see!\xE2\x80\x9D
 holding up his dripping hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut for your face I should think you were a little despondent,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of that
there rippling at the boat\xE2\x80\x99s head making a sort of a Sunday tune. Maybe
I\xE2\x80\x99m a growing a trifle old besides.\xE2\x80\x9D

He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of
face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of
England. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been
in constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer
into the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he would
be safest where he was, and he said. \xE2\x80\x9CDo you, dear boy?\xE2\x80\x9D and quietly sat
down again.

The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the
sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose
none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By
imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of the
nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the muddy
banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend. As our
charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a boat or
two\xE2\x80\x99s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch the
stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a large
transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And soon
the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,
and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking
advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us
in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of
the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and
mudbanks.

Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive
with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour\xE2\x80\x99s rest
proved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery
stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about.
It was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a
dim horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great
floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed
stranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round
the last low point we had headed; and the last green barge, straw-laden,
with a brown sail, had followed; and some ballast-lighters, shaped like
a child\xE2\x80\x99s first rude imitation of a boat, lay low in the mud; and a
little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud
on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy
stones stuck out of the mud, and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck
out of the mud, and an old landing-stage and an old roofless building
slipped into the mud, and all about us was stagnation and mud.

We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder work
now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and rowed
until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a little,
so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on the low
level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black; and
there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising
grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life, save here and
there in the foreground a melancholy gull.

As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,
would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for clearly
our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find. So,
they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a
house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. It
was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her galley-fire smoking
and flaring, looked like a comfortable home. The night was as dark by
this time as it would be until morning; and what light we had, seemed
to come more from the river than the sky, as the oars in their dipping
struck at a few reflected stars.

At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that
we were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular
intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or
other of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and
there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little
creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them
nervously. Sometimes, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat was that ripple?\xE2\x80\x9D one of us would say in a
low voice. Or another, \xE2\x80\x9CIs that a boat yonder?\xE2\x80\x9D And afterwards we would
fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what
an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.

At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran
alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard
by. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light
to be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I
dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good
fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various
liquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,--\xE2\x80\x9Csuch as
they were,\xE2\x80\x9D the landlord said. No other company was in the house than
the landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the \xE2\x80\x9CJack\xE2\x80\x9D of the
little causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low-water
mark too.

With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came
ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all
else, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the
kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop
were to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as
carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there
were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have
thought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,
notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.

While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the
Jack--who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes
on, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as
interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of
a drowned seaman washed ashore--asked me if we had seen a four-oared
galley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must have
gone down then, and yet she \xE2\x80\x9Ctook up too,\xE2\x80\x9D when she left there.

\xE2\x80\x9CThey must ha\xE2\x80\x99 thought better on\xE2\x80\x99t for some reason or another,\xE2\x80\x9D said the
Jack, \xE2\x80\x9Cand gone down.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA four-oared galley, did you say?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CA four,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Jack, \xE2\x80\x9Cand two sitters.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid they come ashore here?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThey put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I\xE2\x80\x99d ha\xE2\x80\x99 been
glad to pison the beer myself,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Jack, \xE2\x80\x9Cor put some rattling
physic in it.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI know why,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud
had washed into his throat.

\xE2\x80\x9CHe thinks,\xE2\x80\x9D said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale eye,
who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,--\xE2\x80\x9Che thinks they was, what they
wasn\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI knows what I thinks,\xE2\x80\x9D observed the Jack.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou thinks Custum \xE2\x80\x98Us, Jack?\xE2\x80\x9D said the landlord.

\xE2\x80\x9CI do,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Jack.

\xE2\x80\x9CThen you\xE2\x80\x99re wrong, Jack.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAM I!\xE2\x80\x9D

In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in
his views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into
it, knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on
again. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he could
afford to do anything.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,
Jack?\xE2\x80\x9D asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.

\xE2\x80\x9CDone with their buttons?\xE2\x80\x9D returned the Jack. \xE2\x80\x9CChucked \xE2\x80\x98em overboard.
Swallered \xE2\x80\x98em. Sowed \xE2\x80\x98em, to come up small salad. Done with their
buttons!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t be cheeky, Jack,\xE2\x80\x9D remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and
pathetic way.

\xE2\x80\x9CA Custum \xE2\x80\x98Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Jack,
repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen they
comes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters don\xE2\x80\x99t go
hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and both
with and against another, without there being Custum \xE2\x80\x98Us at the bottom
of it.\xE2\x80\x9D Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord, having no
one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the subject.

This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind
was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and
I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley
hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly
circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced Provis to
go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop by this
time knew the state of the case), and held another council. Whether we
should remain at the house until near the steamer\xE2\x80\x99s time, which would
be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off early in the
morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we deemed it the
better course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the
steamer\xE2\x80\x99s time, and then to get out in her track, and drift easily with
the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went
to bed.

I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a
few hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house
(the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled
me. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the
window. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,
as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw
two men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at
nothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I
could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction
of the Nore.

My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going
away. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back
of the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder day
than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I could
see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I soon
lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the matter, and
fell asleep again.

We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before
breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our
charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the
men belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no
thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,--as, indeed,
it might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away
together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take
us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about
noon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he
and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.

He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me on
the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger,
not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As we
approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place, while
I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had passed
in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no boat off
the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were there any
signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the tide was
high, and there might have been some footpints under water.

When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I
waved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;
sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving
about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got
aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that time
it wanted but ten minutes of one o\xE2\x80\x99clock, and we began to look out for
her smoke.

But, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards
we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on
at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity
of saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands
cordially, and neither Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I
saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way
ahead of us, and row out into the same track.

A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer\xE2\x80\x99s smoke,
by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,
coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide,
that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to sit
quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, \xE2\x80\x9CTrust to me,
dear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was very
skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and fallen
alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars, she kept
alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or two when we
pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and looked at us
attentively,--as did all the rowers; the other sitter was wrapped up,
much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some instruction
to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in either boat.

Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,
and gave me the word \xE2\x80\x9CHamburg,\xE2\x80\x9D in a low voice, as we sat face to face.
She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew louder
and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us, when the
galley hailed us. I answered.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have a returned Transport there,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man who held the lines.
\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,
otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,
and you to assist.\xE2\x80\x9D

At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,
he ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead,
had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on to
our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great
confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and
heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but felt
her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw the
steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s shoulder, and saw
that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide, and
saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite
frantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start
up, lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the
shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that the
face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago. Still, in
the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it
that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board the steamer,
and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink from under me.

It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand
mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was
taken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there; but
our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.

What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of
her steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first
distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the
galley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong
strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and
eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,
bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up
his hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and
true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,
but not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled
at the wrists and ankles.

The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water
was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not
understanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had
been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and
we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out was
kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone; but
everybody knew that it was hopeless now.

At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern
we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise. Here
I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,--Provis no longer,--who
had received some very severe injury in the Chest, and a deep cut in the
head.

He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the
steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to
his chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought
he had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did not
pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson, but
that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him,
that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had both gone
overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him (Magwitch) out of
our boat, and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it, had capsized
us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in
each other\xE2\x80\x99s arms, and that there had been a struggle under water, and
that he had disengaged himself, struck out, and swum away.

I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me.
The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going
overboard.

When I asked this officer\xE2\x80\x99s permission to change the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s
wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the
public-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take
charge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book
which had once been in my hands passed into the officer\xE2\x80\x99s. He further
gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to
accord that grace to my two friends.

The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone
down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was
likeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to
be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it
took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may
have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in
various stages of decay.

We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then Magwitch
was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and Startop
were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a doleful
parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch\xE2\x80\x99s side, I felt that that
was my place henceforth while he lived.

For now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,
wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man
who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,
gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a
series of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to
Joe.

His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,
and often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm
I could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that
I could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was
unquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,
people enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not
doubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had
been presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken
prison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation
under a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who
was the cause of his arrest.

As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,
and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how
grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D he answered, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m quite content to take my chance. I\xE2\x80\x99ve seen
my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.\xE2\x80\x9D

No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.
Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s hint now.
I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to
the Crown.

\xE2\x80\x9CLookee here, dear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D said he \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s best as a gentleman should not be
knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by chance
alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for the
last o\xE2\x80\x99 many times, and I don\xE2\x80\x99t ask no more.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will never stir from your side,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen I am suffered to be
near you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!\xE2\x80\x9D

I felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away
as he lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his
throat,--softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing
that he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might not
otherwise have thought of until too late,--that he need never know how
his hopes of enriching me had perished.




Chapter LV

He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been
immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down
for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped, to
speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had meant
to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened that
there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give
the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his private
house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and Mr.
Jaggers on the prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s behalf would admit nothing. It was the sole
resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes
when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent its
going against us.

I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the
fate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for
having \xE2\x80\x9Clet it slip through my fingers,\xE2\x80\x9D and said we must memorialize
by and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal
from me that, although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture
would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make
it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not related to the
outlaw, or connected with him by any recognizable tie; he had put his
hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension,
and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I finally resolved,
and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my heart should never
be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one.

There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer
had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some
accurate knowledge of Magwitch\xE2\x80\x99s affairs. When his body was found, many
miles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he
was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still
legible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a
banking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the
designation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of
information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.
Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His ignorance,
poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but that my
inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers\xE2\x80\x99s aid.

After three days\xE2\x80\x99 delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over
for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness
came, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial at
the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.

It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one
evening, a good deal cast down, and said,--

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.\xE2\x80\x9D

His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he
thought.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am
very much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHerbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but
my need is no greater now than at another time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou will be so lonely.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have not leisure to think of that,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CYou know that I am
always with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I
should be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away from
him, you know that my thoughts are with him.\xE2\x80\x9D

The dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to both
of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear fellow,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Clet the near prospect of our
separation--for, it is very near--be my justification for troubling you
about yourself. Have you thought of your future?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, for I have been afraid to think of any future.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not
be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly
words go, with me.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI will,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CIn this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a--\xE2\x80\x9D

I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, \xE2\x80\x9CA
clerk.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CA clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as
a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,
Handel,--in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?\xE2\x80\x9D

There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in
which after saying \xE2\x80\x9CNow, Handel,\xE2\x80\x9D as if it were the grave beginning of
a portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,
stretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.

\xE2\x80\x9CClara and I have talked about it again and again,\xE2\x80\x9D Herbert pursued,
\xE2\x80\x9Cand the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in
her eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come
together, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her
husband\xE2\x80\x99s friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,
Handel!\xE2\x80\x9D

I thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could not
yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my
mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.
Secondly,--Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my
thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury
to your business, leave the question open for a little while--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CFor any while,\xE2\x80\x9D cried Herbert. \xE2\x80\x9CSix months, a year!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot so long as that,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CTwo or three months at most.\xE2\x80\x9D

Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,
and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must
go away at the end of the week.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Clara?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe dear little thing,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Herbert, \xE2\x80\x9Cholds dutifully to her
father as long as he lasts; but he won\xE2\x80\x99t last long. Mrs. Whimple
confides to me that he is certainly going.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot to say an unfeeling thing,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Che cannot do better than go.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am afraid that must be admitted,\xE2\x80\x9D said Herbert; \xE2\x80\x9Cand then I shall
come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I
will walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed darling
comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book,
and hasn\xE2\x80\x99t a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for the son of
my mother!\xE2\x80\x9D

On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,--full
of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,--as he sat on one of the
seaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note
to Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and
over again, and then went to my lonely home,--if it deserved the name;
for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.

On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an
unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him
alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had
come, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of
explanation in reference to that failure.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe late Compeyson,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Chad by little and little got at the
bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was from
the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people being
always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open, seeming
to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I thought that
would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only suppose now,
that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man, habitually to
deceive his own instruments. You don\xE2\x80\x99t blame me, I hope, Mr. Pip? I am
sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most
earnestly for all your interest and friendship.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you, thank you very much. It\xE2\x80\x99s a bad job,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick,
scratching his head, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I assure you I haven\xE2\x80\x99t been so cut up for a
long time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property.
Dear me!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, to be sure,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9COf course, there can be no objection
to your being sorry for him, and I\xE2\x80\x99d put down a five-pound note myself
to get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson
having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and being
so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have been
saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved.
That\xE2\x80\x99s the difference between the property and the owner, don\xE2\x80\x99t you
see?\xE2\x80\x9D

I invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass
of grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he
was drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up to
it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,--

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThese twelve years, more likely,\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CYes. I\xE2\x80\x99m going to take
a holiday. More than that; I\xE2\x80\x99m going to take a walk. More than that; I\xE2\x80\x99m
going to ask you to take a walk with me.\xE2\x80\x9D

I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,
when Wemmick anticipated me.

\xE2\x80\x9CI know your engagements,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I know you are out of sorts,
Mr. Pip. But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.
It ain\xE2\x80\x99t a long walk, and it\xE2\x80\x99s an early one. Say it might occupy you
(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn\xE2\x80\x99t you
stretch a point and manage it?\xE2\x80\x9D

He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little
to do for him. I said I could manage it,--would manage it,--and he was
so very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his
particular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half
past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.

Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday
morning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking
tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two
glasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have
been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his
bedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.

When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and
were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was
considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put
it over his shoulder. \xE2\x80\x9CWhy, we are not going fishing!\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CNo,\xE2\x80\x9D
 returned Wemmick, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I like to walk with one.\xE2\x80\x9D

I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went
towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said
suddenly,--

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa! Here\xE2\x80\x99s a church!\xE2\x80\x9D

There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather
surprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,--

\xE2\x80\x9CLet\xE2\x80\x99s go in!\xE2\x80\x9D

We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked all
round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets, and
getting something out of paper there.

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa!\xE2\x80\x9D said he. \xE2\x80\x9CHere\xE2\x80\x99s a couple of pair of gloves! Let\xE2\x80\x99s put \xE2\x80\x98em
on!\xE2\x80\x9D

As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened
to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They
were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side
door, escorting a lady.

\xE2\x80\x9CHalloa!\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick. \xE2\x80\x9CHere\xE2\x80\x99s Miss Skiffins! Let\xE2\x80\x99s have a wedding.\xE2\x80\x9D

That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now
engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The
Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for
the altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much
difficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary
to put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the
pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old
gentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe
resistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to
perfection.

The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at
those fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without
preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out of
his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, \xE2\x80\x9CHalloa! Here\xE2\x80\x99s a ring!\xE2\x80\x9D

I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; while
a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby\xE2\x80\x99s, made a feint
of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of giving
the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergyman\xE2\x80\x99s being
unintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus. When he said, \xE2\x80\x9CWho
giveth this woman to be married to this man?\xE2\x80\x9D the old gentleman, not in
the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood
most amiably beaming at the ten commandments. Upon which, the clergyman
said again, \xE2\x80\x9CWHO giveth this woman to be married to this man?\xE2\x80\x9D The old
gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the
bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice, \xE2\x80\x9CNow Aged P. you know; who
giveth?\xE2\x80\x9D To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before saying
that he gave, \xE2\x80\x9CAll right, John, all right, my boy!\xE2\x80\x9D And the clergyman
came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment
whether we should get completely married that day.

It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church
Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it, and
put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put
her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. \xE2\x80\x9CNow, Mr. Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D
 said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came
out, \xE2\x80\x9Clet me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a
wedding-party!\xE2\x80\x9D

Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so
away upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle
board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after
the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer
unwound Wemmick\xE2\x80\x99s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in a
high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and
submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done.

We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on
table, Wemmick said, \xE2\x80\x9CProvided by contract, you know; don\xE2\x80\x99t be afraid of
it!\xE2\x80\x9D I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the Castle,
saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could.

Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with him,
and wished him joy.

\xE2\x80\x9CThankee!\xE2\x80\x9D said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. \xE2\x80\x9CShe\xE2\x80\x99s such a manager
of fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for
yourself. I say, Mr. Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D calling me back, and speaking low. \xE2\x80\x9CThis is
altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

Wemmick nodded. \xE2\x80\x9CAfter what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers
may as well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or
something of the kind.\xE2\x80\x9D




Chapter LVI

He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his
committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken
two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great
pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his
hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke
very little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the
first duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he
ought to hear.

Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after
the first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities
of being with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for
his illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a
determined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.

Although I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the
regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record
on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I
do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he
wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day
when the prison door closed upon him.

The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man
who was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner
or from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered
over the question whether he might have been a better man under better
circumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that
way, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.

It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his desperate
reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on
him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his eyes on me with
a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had seen some small
redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was a little child.
As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I never knew him
complain.

When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be
made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. It
was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,
and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the
bar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting
close to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he
stretched forth to me.

The trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said
for him were said,--how he had taken to industrious habits, and had
thriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that
he had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It was
impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him guilty.

At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible experience
of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing of
Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death.
But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me,
I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I saw
two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that
sentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,
that he might get breath enough to keep life in him.

The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment, down
to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering in
the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it
at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men
and women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and
weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There
had been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been
stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains
and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great
gallery full of people,--a large theatrical audience,--looked on, as the
two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge
addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must
single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had
been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments and
punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years;
and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had made his
escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable man would
seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when far removed
from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and
honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and
passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to
society, he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance, and had
come back to the country where he was proscribed. Being here presently
denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of
Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, he had
resisted them, and had--he best knew whether by express design, or in
the blindness of his hardihood--caused the death of his denouncer, to
whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment for his return
to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his case being this
aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.

The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the
glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of
light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,
and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,
with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things,
and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this
way of light, the prisoner said, \xE2\x80\x9CMy Lord, I have received my sentence
of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,\xE2\x80\x9D and sat down again.
There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had to say
to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of them were
supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of
bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands,
and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from
the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of having to
be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held my hand
while all the others were removed, and while the audience got up
(putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere), and
pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him and me.

I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder\xE2\x80\x99s
Report was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that
night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting
forth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my
sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I
had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men
in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the
Crown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took
no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed
in these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away
from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more
hopeful and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable
restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,
wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions. To
the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold, dusty
spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and their
long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.

The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more
strictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention
of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I sat down
at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there, that I was
willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my
designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There was duty to be
done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer always gave me the
assurance that he was worse, and some other sick prisoners in the
room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses,
(malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be thanked!) always
joined in the same report.

As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly
looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face
until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would
subside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then
he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to
understand his meaning very well.

The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change
in him than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and
lighted up as I entered.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear boy,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, as I sat down by his bed: \xE2\x80\x9CI thought you was late.
But I knowed you couldn\xE2\x80\x99t be that.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is just the time,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CI waited for it at the gate.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou always waits at the gate; don\xE2\x80\x99t you, dear boy?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes. Not to lose a moment of the time.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank\xE2\x80\x99ee dear boy, thank\xE2\x80\x99ee. God bless you! You\xE2\x80\x99ve never deserted me,
dear boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

I pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once
meant to desert him.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd what\xE2\x80\x99s the best of all,\xE2\x80\x9D he said, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou\xE2\x80\x99ve been more comfortable
alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.
That\xE2\x80\x99s best of all.\xE2\x80\x9D

He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,
and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and a
film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.

\xE2\x80\x9CAre you in much pain to-day?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t complain of none, dear boy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou never do complain.\xE2\x80\x9D

He had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to
mean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid it
there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.

The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I
found the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,
\xE2\x80\x9CYou needn\xE2\x80\x99t go yet.\xE2\x80\x9D I thanked him gratefully, and asked, \xE2\x80\x9CMight I
speak to him, if he can hear me?\xE2\x80\x9D

The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,
though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid
look at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I
say?\xE2\x80\x9D

A gentle pressure on my hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou had a child once, whom you loved and lost.\xE2\x80\x9D

A stronger pressure on my hand.

\xE2\x80\x9CShe lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a lady
and very beautiful. And I love her!\xE2\x80\x9D

With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my
yielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,
he gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying on
it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and
his head dropped quietly on his breast.

Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men
who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better
words that I could say beside his bed, than \xE2\x80\x9CO Lord, be merciful to him
a sinner!\xE2\x80\x9D




Chapter LVII

Now that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention
to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally
determine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills
up in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and
began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought
rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and
concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth
beyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me had
enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that it
was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless
as to that.

For a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,--anywhere,
according as I happened to sink down,--with a heavy head and aching
limbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which
appeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;
and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I
found I could not do so.

Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night,
groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether I had
two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror,
not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself
lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up
the stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been
inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning
of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making;
whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of
the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Miss
Havisham was consuming within it,--these were things that I tried to
settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on
my bed. But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them,
disordering them all, and it was through the vapor at last that I saw
two men looking at me.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you want?\xE2\x80\x9D I asked, starting; \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know you.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the
shoulder, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is a matter that you\xE2\x80\x99ll soon arrange, I dare say, but
you\xE2\x80\x99re arrested.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is the debt?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CHundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller\xE2\x80\x99s account, I
think.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhat is to be done?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou had better come to my house,\xE2\x80\x9D said the man. \xE2\x80\x9CI keep a very nice
house.\xE2\x80\x9D

I made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended
to them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I
still lay there.

\xE2\x80\x9CYou see my state,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CI would come with you if I could; but
indeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die
by the way.\xE2\x80\x9D

Perhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to
believe that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in
my memory by only this one slender thread, I don\xE2\x80\x99t know what they did,
except that they forbore to remove me.

That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that
I often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I
confounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a
brick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the
giddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a
vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored
in my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered
off; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own
remembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes
struggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and
that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and
would then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me
down, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a
constant tendency in all these people,--who, when I was very ill, would
present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,
and would be much dilated in size,--above all, I say, I knew that there
was an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to
settle down into the likeness of Joe.

After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice that
while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature did
not change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I opened
my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the bedside, Joe.
I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the window-seat, smoking
his pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw Joe. I asked for cooling
drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was Joe\xE2\x80\x99s. I sank back on
my pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and
tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.

At last, one day, I took courage, and said, \xE2\x80\x9CIs it Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

And the dear old home-voice answered, \xE2\x80\x9CWhich it air, old chap.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tell
me of my ingratitude. Don\xE2\x80\x99t be so good to me!\xE2\x80\x9D

For Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, and
put his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich dear old Pip, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou and me was ever friends.
And when you\xE2\x80\x99re well enough to go out for a ride--what larks!\xE2\x80\x9D

After which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back towards
me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me from
getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering, \xE2\x80\x9CO God
bless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe\xE2\x80\x99s eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but I was holding
his hand, and we both felt happy.

\xE2\x80\x9CHow long, dear Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old
chap?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd have you been here all that time, dear Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your
being ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post, and
being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of
walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part, and
marriage were the great wish of his hart--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you
said to Biddy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich it were,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat how you might be amongst strangers, and
that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a moment
might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, \xE2\x80\x98Go to him,
without loss of time.\xE2\x80\x99 That,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, summing up with his judicial
air, \xE2\x80\x9Cwere the word of Biddy. \xE2\x80\x98Go to him,\xE2\x80\x99 Biddy say, \xE2\x80\x98without loss of
time.\xE2\x80\x99 In short, I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t greatly deceive you,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe added, after a
little grave reflection, \xE2\x80\x9Cif I represented to you that the word of that
young woman were, \xE2\x80\x98without a minute\xE2\x80\x99s loss of time.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

There Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked
to in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at
stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that
I was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay
quiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.

Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at him,
it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the
pride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its
curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as
the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and
the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own
writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,
Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the
pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his
sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was
necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,
and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin; and
when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might
have been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen
spluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was
on the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into
space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was
tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole
he got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had
removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with
his two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the
effect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,
with unbounded satisfaction.

Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to
talk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He
shook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.

\xE2\x80\x9CIs she dead, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhy you see, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way
of getting at it by degrees, \xE2\x80\x9CI wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t go so far as to say that, for
that\xE2\x80\x99s a deal to say; but she ain\xE2\x80\x99t--\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLiving, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s nigher where it is,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe; \xE2\x80\x9Cshe ain\xE2\x80\x99t living.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid she linger long, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CArter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you
was put to it) a week,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe; still determined, on my account, to
come at everything by degrees.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cit do appear that she had settled the most
of it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had
wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the
accident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,
do you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand
unto him? \xE2\x80\x98Because of Pip\xE2\x80\x99s account of him, the said Matthew.\xE2\x80\x99 I am told
by Biddy, that air the writing,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, repeating the legal turn as
if it did him infinite good, \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98account of him the said Matthew.\xE2\x80\x99 And a
cool four thousand, Pip!\xE2\x80\x9D

I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of
the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money more
to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool.

This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I
had done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations
had any legacies?

\xE2\x80\x9CMiss Sarah,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe have twenty-five pound perannium fur to
buy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty
pound down. Mrs.--what\xE2\x80\x99s the name of them wild beasts with humps, old
chap?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CCamels?\xE2\x80\x9D said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.

Joe nodded. \xE2\x80\x9CMrs. Camels,\xE2\x80\x9D by which I presently understood he meant
Camilla, \xE2\x80\x9Cshe have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in
spirits when she wake up in the night.\xE2\x80\x9D

The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give
me great confidence in Joe\xE2\x80\x99s information. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd now,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou
ain\xE2\x80\x99t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one
additional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he\xE2\x80\x99s been a bustin\xE2\x80\x99 open a
dwelling-ouse.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhose?\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CNot, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Joe, apologetically; \xE2\x80\x9Cstill, a Englishman\xE2\x80\x99s ouse is his Castle, and
castles must not be busted \xE2\x80\x98cept when done in war time. And wotsume\xE2\x80\x99er
the failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it Pumblechook\xE2\x80\x99s house that has been broken into, then?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThat\xE2\x80\x99s it, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe; \xE2\x80\x9Cand they took his till, and they took his
cash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,
and they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him
up to his bedpust, and they giv\xE2\x80\x99 him a dozen, and they stuffed his
mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he knowed
Orlick, and Orlick\xE2\x80\x99s in the county jail.\xE2\x80\x9D

By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow
to gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe
stayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.

For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,
that I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in the
old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old unassertive
protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my life since the
days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that
was gone. He did everything for me except the household work, for which
he had engaged a very decent woman, after paying off the laundress on
his first arrival. \xE2\x80\x9CWhich I do assure you, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D he would often say, in
explanation of that liberty; \xE2\x80\x9CI found her a tapping the spare bed, like
a cask of beer, and drawing off the feathers in a bucket, for sale.
Which she would have tapped yourn next, and draw\xE2\x80\x99d it off with you a
laying on it, and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in
the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the wine and spirits in your
Wellington boots.\xE2\x80\x9D

We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had
once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day
came, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,
took me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were
still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of
the wealth of his great nature.

And Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,
where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,
and sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be
Sunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought
how it had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been
forming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and
by night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning
and tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed
there came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday
bells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt
that I was not nearly thankful enough,--that I was too weak yet to be
even that,--and I laid my head on Joe\xE2\x80\x99s shoulder, as I had laid it long
ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much
for my young senses.

More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used
to talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change
whatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my
eyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.

When we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me--so
easily!--across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful
Christmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet
made any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of
my late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself now,
and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself whether I
ought to refer to it when he did not.

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you heard, Joe,\xE2\x80\x9D I asked him that evening, upon further
consideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, \xE2\x80\x9Cwho my patron was?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI heerd,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cas it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you hear who it was, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv\xE2\x80\x99 you
the bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo it was.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAstonishing!\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, in the placidest way.

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you hear that he was dead, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D I presently asked, with increasing
diffidence.

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI think,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather
evasively at the window-seat, \xE2\x80\x9Cas I did hear tell that how he were
something or another in a general way in that direction.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDid you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNot partickler, Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIf you would like to hear, Joe--\xE2\x80\x9D I was beginning, when Joe got up and
came to my sofa.

\xE2\x80\x9CLookee here, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, bending over me. \xE2\x80\x9CEver the best of
friends; ain\xE2\x80\x99t us, Pip?\xE2\x80\x9D

I was ashamed to answer him.

\xE2\x80\x9CWery good, then,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, as if I had answered; \xE2\x80\x9Cthat\xE2\x80\x99s all right;
that\xE2\x80\x99s agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as
betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There\xE2\x80\x99s subjects enough
as betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your
poor sister and her Rampages! And don\xE2\x80\x99t you remember Tickler?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI do indeed, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLookee here, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CI done what I could to keep you
and Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my
inclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it
were not so much,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, in his favorite argumentative way, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat
she dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that
she dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain\xE2\x80\x99t a
grab at a man\xE2\x80\x99s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your
sister was quite welcome), that \xE2\x80\x98ud put a man off from getting a little
child out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into
heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up
and says to himself, \xE2\x80\x98Where is the good as you are a doing? I grant you
I see the \xE2\x80\x98arm,\xE2\x80\x99 says the man, \xE2\x80\x98but I don\xE2\x80\x99t see the good. I call upon
you, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe man says?\xE2\x80\x9D I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.

\xE2\x80\x9CThe man says,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe assented. \xE2\x80\x9CIs he right, that man?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Joe, he is always right.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWell, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, \xE2\x80\x9Cthen abide by your words. If he\xE2\x80\x99s always
right (which in general he\xE2\x80\x99s more likely wrong), he\xE2\x80\x99s right when he says
this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when you
was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know\xE2\x80\x99d as J. Gargery\xE2\x80\x99s
power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his
inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do
not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy giv\xE2\x80\x99 herself a
deal o\xE2\x80\x99 trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost awful dull), as I
should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this light, as I should
so put it. Both of which,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, quite charmed with his logical
arrangement, \xE2\x80\x9Cbeing done, now this to you a true friend, say. Namely.
You mustn\xE2\x80\x99t go a overdoing on it, but you must have your supper and your
wine and water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets.\xE2\x80\x9D

The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and
kindness with which Biddy--who with her woman\xE2\x80\x99s wit had found me out so
soon--had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But
whether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had
all dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not
understand.

Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to
develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension
of, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less
easy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear
fellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,
the dear \xE2\x80\x9Cold Pip, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D that now were music in my ears. I too had
fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,
imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe\xE2\x80\x99s hold upon them began
to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to
understand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was
all mine.

Ah! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that
in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given
Joe\xE2\x80\x99s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got
stronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better
loosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?

It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the
Temple Gardens leaning on Joe\xE2\x80\x99s arm, that I saw this change in him very
plainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at the
river, and I chanced to say as we got up,--

\xE2\x80\x9CSee, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back by
myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWhich do not overdo it, Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe; \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I shall be happy fur to
see you able, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no
further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be
weaker than I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was
thoughtful.

I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing
change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I
was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come
down to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not
quite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little
savings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I
must not suffer him to do it.

It was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to
bed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,--to-morrow being
Sunday,--and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday
morning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this
last vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts
(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go
out to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I
cleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically
arrived at a resolution too.

We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and
then walked in the fields.

\xE2\x80\x9CI feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,\xE2\x80\x9D I said.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear old Pip, old chap, you\xE2\x80\x99re a\xE2\x80\x99most come round, sir.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt has been a memorable time for me, Joe.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CLikeways for myself, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D Joe returned.

\xE2\x80\x9CWe have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were
days once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall
forget these.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CPip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, \xE2\x80\x9Cthere has
been larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us--have been.\xE2\x80\x9D

At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done
all through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well
as in the morning?

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, dear Joe, quite.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd are always a getting stronger, old chap?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, dear Joe, steadily.\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and
said, in what I thought a husky voice, \xE2\x80\x9CGood night!\xE2\x80\x9D

When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of
my resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before
breakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;
for, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and
he was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.

I hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These
were its brief contents:--

\xE2\x80\x9CNot wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear
Pip and will do better without JO.

\xE2\x80\x9CP.S. Ever the best of friends.\xE2\x80\x9D

Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I
had been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my
creditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be quite
recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe\xE2\x80\x99s having paid the money; but Joe
had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.

What remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and
there to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance
with him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved
Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts,
and had formed into a settled purpose?

The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how
humbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost
all I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in
my first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, \xE2\x80\x9CBiddy, I think you once
liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed away
from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since.
If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take me with
all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can receive me like
a forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and have as much need
of a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am a little worthier
of you that I was,--not much, but a little. And, Biddy, it shall rest
with you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe, or whether I
shall try for any different occupation down in this country, or whether
we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which
I set aside, when it was offered, until I knew your answer. And now,
dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will go through the world with
me, you will surely make it a better world for me, and me a better man
for it, and I will try hard to make it a better world for you.\xE2\x80\x9D

Such was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to
the old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I have
left to tell.




Chapter LVIII

The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down
to my native place and its neighborhood before I got there. I found the
Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a
great change in the Boar\xE2\x80\x99s demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated
my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,
the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of
property.

It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so
often made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,
which was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and
could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and
post-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as
in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and the
quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.

Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled
round by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits
of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of
the Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to
be sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in
whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of
the main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were marked
off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to
make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust
and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open gate, and
looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no
business there, I saw the auctioneer\xE2\x80\x99s clerk walking on the casks and
telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler, pen in
hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often
pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.

When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar\xE2\x80\x99s coffee-room, I found Mr.
Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improved
in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and
addressed me in the following terms:--

\xE2\x80\x9CYoung man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be
expected! what else could be expected!\xE2\x80\x9D

As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I was
broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.

\xE2\x80\x9CWilliam,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, \xE2\x80\x9Cput a muffin on table.
And has it come to this! Has it come to this!\xE2\x80\x9D

I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and
poured out my tea--before I could touch the teapot--with the air of a
benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.

\xE2\x80\x9CWilliam,\xE2\x80\x9D said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, \xE2\x80\x9Cput the salt on. In
happier times,\xE2\x80\x9D addressing me, \xE2\x80\x9CI think you took sugar? And did you take
milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThank you,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, shortly, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut I don\xE2\x80\x99t eat watercresses.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou don\xE2\x80\x99t eat \xE2\x80\x98em,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding
his head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if
abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. \xE2\x80\x9CTrue.
The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn\xE2\x80\x99t bring any, William.\xE2\x80\x9D

I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over
me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.

\xE2\x80\x9CLittle more than skin and bone!\xE2\x80\x9D mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd yet
when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread afore
him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!\xE2\x80\x9D

This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner
in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, \xE2\x80\x9CMay I?\xE2\x80\x9D
 and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the
same fat five fingers.

\xE2\x80\x9CHah!\xE2\x80\x9D he went on, handing me the bread and butter. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd air you a going
to Joseph?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIn heaven\xE2\x80\x99s name,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, firing in spite of myself, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat does it
matter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.\xE2\x80\x9D

It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook
the opportunity he wanted.

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, young man,\xE2\x80\x9D said he, releasing the handle of the article in
question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the
behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, \xE2\x80\x9CI will leave that teapot
alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I forgit myself
when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to wish your frame,
exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality, to be stimilated
by the \xE2\x80\x98olesome nourishment of your forefathers. And yet,\xE2\x80\x9D said
Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at
arm\xE2\x80\x99s length, \xE2\x80\x9Cthis is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy
infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I tell you this is him!\xE2\x80\x9D

A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be
particularly affected.

\xE2\x80\x9CThis is him,\xE2\x80\x9D said Pumblechook, \xE2\x80\x9Cas I have rode in my shay-cart. This
is him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister
of which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M\xE2\x80\x99ria from
her own mother, let him deny it if he can!\xE2\x80\x9D

The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave
the case a black look.

\xE2\x80\x9CYoung man,\xE2\x80\x9D said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old
fashion, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou air a going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you
ask me, where you air a going? I say to you, Sir, you air a going to
Joseph.\xE2\x80\x9D

The waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow,\xE2\x80\x9D said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air
of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and
conclusive, \xE2\x80\x9CI will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of
the Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is William,
which his father\xE2\x80\x99s name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou do not, sir,\xE2\x80\x9D said William.

\xE2\x80\x9CIn their presence,\xE2\x80\x9D pursued Pumblechook, \xE2\x80\x9CI will tell you, young
man, what to say to Joseph. Says you, \xE2\x80\x9CJoseph, I have this day seen
my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun\xE2\x80\x99s. I will name no
names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have
seen that man.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI swear I don\xE2\x80\x99t see him here,\xE2\x80\x9D said I.

\xE2\x80\x9CSay that likewise,\xE2\x80\x9D retorted Pumblechook. \xE2\x80\x9CSay you said that, and even
Joseph will probably betray surprise.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThere you quite mistake him,\xE2\x80\x9D said I. \xE2\x80\x9CI know better.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSays you,\xE2\x80\x9D Pumblechook went on, \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98Joseph, I have seen that man, and
that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your
character, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and
ignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of
gratitoode. Yes, Joseph,\xE2\x80\x99 says you,\xE2\x80\x9D here Pumblechook shook his head and
hand at me, \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode.
He knows it, Joseph, as none can. You do not know it, Joseph, having no
call to know it, but that man do.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face
to talk thus to mine.

\xE2\x80\x9CSays you, \xE2\x80\x98Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now
repeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of
Providence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it
plain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. Reward of ingratitoode to his
earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun\xE2\x80\x99s. But that man said he did
not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to do
it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would do it
again.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s pity,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast,
\xE2\x80\x9Cthat the man did not say what he had done and would do again.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSquires of the Boar!\xE2\x80\x9D Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord, \xE2\x80\x9Cand
William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town or down
town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do it, kind to
do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.\xE2\x80\x9D

With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,
and left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by
the virtues of that same indefinite \xE2\x80\x9Cit.\xE2\x80\x9D I was not long after him in
leaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him
holding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to a select
group, who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the
opposite side of the way.

But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose
great forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,
contrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for
my limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew
nearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness
further and further behind.

The June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were soaring
high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful
and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many pleasant
pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the change for the
better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at
my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved, beguiled
my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for my heart was softened
by my return, and such a change had come to pass, that I felt like one
who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings
had lasted many years.

The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the
little roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness\xE2\x80\x99
sake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a
holiday; no children were there, and Biddy\xE2\x80\x99s house was closed. Some
hopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties, before
she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.

But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under
the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe\xE2\x80\x99s hammer. Long
after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it
and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there, and the
white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and their
leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the clink of
Joe\xE2\x80\x99s hammer was not in the midsummer wind.

Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I saw
it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no glittering
shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still.

But the house was not deserted, and the best parlor seemed to be in use,
for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the window
was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning to peep
over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in arm.

At first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but
in another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she wept
to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she, because I
looked so worn and white.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut dear Biddy, how smart you are!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, dear Pip.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Joe, how smart you are!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, dear old Pip, old chap.\xE2\x80\x9D

I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then--

\xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s my wedding-day!\xE2\x80\x9D cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, \xE2\x80\x9Cand I am
married to Joe!\xE2\x80\x9D

They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on
the old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe\xE2\x80\x99s
restoring touch was on my shoulder. \xE2\x80\x9CWhich he warn\xE2\x80\x99t strong enough, my
dear, fur to be surprised,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. And Biddy said, \xE2\x80\x9CI ought to
have thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.\xE2\x80\x9D They were both so
overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to
them, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day
complete!

My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed
this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me in my
illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been his
knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Biddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou have the best husband in the whole world,
and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have--But no, you
couldn\xE2\x80\x99t love him better than you do.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t indeed,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will
make you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble Joe!\xE2\x80\x9D

Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before
his eyes.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in
charity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you
have done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I am
going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I shall
never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me
out of prison, and have sent it to you, don\xE2\x80\x99t think, dear Joe and Biddy,
that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I could cancel
a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if I could!\xE2\x80\x9D

They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no
more.

\xE2\x80\x9CBut I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,
and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter
night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for
ever. Don\xE2\x80\x99t tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don\xE2\x80\x99t tell him, Biddy,
that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honored you both,
because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child, I said
it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI ain\xE2\x80\x99t a going,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe, from behind his sleeve, \xE2\x80\x9Cto tell him
nothink o\xE2\x80\x99 that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain\xE2\x80\x99t. Nor yet no one ain\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind
hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you
say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and then
I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better of
me, in the time to come!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO dear old Pip, old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe. \xE2\x80\x9CGod knows as I forgive you, if I
have anythink to forgive!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAmen! And God knows I do!\xE2\x80\x9D echoed Biddy.

\xE2\x80\x9CNow let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few
minutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go
with me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say
good-bye!\xE2\x80\x9D

***

I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition
with my creditors,--who gave me ample time to pay them in full,--and I
went out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England,
and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four
months I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across
the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under
old Bill Barley\xE2\x80\x99s growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to
marry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until
he brought her back.

Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived
happily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my
debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It
was not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to
Herbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s partnership
had been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So he
told it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow
and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not
leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we made
mints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a
good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so
much to Herbert\xE2\x80\x99s ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often
wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I
was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude
had never been in him at all, but had been in me.




Chapter LIX

For eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily
eyes,--though they had both been often before my fancy in the
East,--when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I
laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it
so softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking his
pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as strong as
ever, though a little gray, sat Joe; and there, fenced into the corner
with Joe\xE2\x80\x99s leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire,
was--I again!

\xE2\x80\x9CWe giv\xE2\x80\x99 him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,\xE2\x80\x9D said Joe,
delighted, when I took another stool by the child\xE2\x80\x99s side (but I did not
rumple his hair), \xE2\x80\x9Cand we hoped he might grow a little bit like you, and
we think he do.\xE2\x80\x9D

I thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we
talked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took
him down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,
and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the
memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife
of the Above.

\xE2\x80\x9CBiddy,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little girl
lay sleeping in her lap, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou must give Pip to me one of these days; or
lend him, at all events.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNo, no,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, gently. \xE2\x80\x9CYou must marry.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CSo Herbert and Clara say, but I don\xE2\x80\x99t think I shall, Biddy. I have so
settled down in their home, that it\xE2\x80\x99s not at all likely. I am already
quite an old bachelor.\xE2\x80\x9D

Biddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips, and
then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine.
There was something in the action, and in the light pressure of Biddy\xE2\x80\x99s
wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.

\xE2\x80\x9CDear Pip,\xE2\x80\x9D said Biddy, \xE2\x80\x9Cyou are sure you don\xE2\x80\x99t fret for her?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CO no,--I think not, Biddy.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CTell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?

\xE2\x80\x9CMy dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a
foremost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But that
poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,--all gone
by!\xE2\x80\x9D

Nevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly intended
to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for her sake.
Yes, even so. For Estella\xE2\x80\x99s sake.

I had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being
separated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, and who
had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice, brutality,
and meanness. And I had heard of the death of her husband, from an
accident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse. This release had
befallen her some two years before; for anything I knew, she was married
again.

The early dinner hour at Joe\xE2\x80\x99s, left me abundance of time, without
hurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.
But, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think
of old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.

There was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the
wall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough
fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck
root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A gate in
the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.

A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet
up to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the
moon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where
every part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,
and where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was looking
along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure in it.

The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving
towards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the
figure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away, when
it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if much
surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,--

\xE2\x80\x9CEstella!\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.\xE2\x80\x9D

The freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable
majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,
I had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,
softened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was
the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.

We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, \xE2\x80\x9CAfter so many years,
it is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our
first meeting was! Do you often come back?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have never been here since.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CNor I.\xE2\x80\x9D

The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white
ceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought of
the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on
earth.

Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.

\xE2\x80\x9CI have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been
prevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!\xE2\x80\x9D

The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and
the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing
that I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she said
quietly,--

\xE2\x80\x9CWere you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this
condition?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYes, Estella.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CThe ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not
relinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I
have kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I
made in all the wretched years.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CIs it to be built on?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAt last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And
you,\xE2\x80\x9D she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,--\xE2\x80\x9Cyou
live abroad still?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CStill.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd do well, I am sure?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore--yes, I do
well.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CI have often thought of you,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella.

\xE2\x80\x9CHave you?\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9COf late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from me
the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant
of its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the
admission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CYou have always held your place in my heart,\xE2\x80\x9D I answered.

And we were silent again until she spoke.

\xE2\x80\x9CI little thought,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella, \xE2\x80\x9Cthat I should take leave of you in
taking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CGlad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,
the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CBut you said to me,\xE2\x80\x9D returned Estella, very earnestly, \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98God bless you,
God forgive you!\xE2\x80\x99 And if you could say that to me then, you will not
hesitate to say that to me now,--now, when suffering has been stronger
than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart
used to be. I have been bent and broken, but--I hope--into a better
shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are
friends.\xE2\x80\x9D

\xE2\x80\x9CWe are friends,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from
the bench.

\xE2\x80\x9CAnd will continue friends apart,\xE2\x80\x9D said Estella.

I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as
the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the
evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil
light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xE2\x80\x99s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
