# Task 0 test script

This tests the validity of the script `my_cvt_img.sh`, which should convert images into jpeg, putting them in the specified directory according to some naming convention.

To run the test, copy the contents of this directory into the directory with the script to be tested. Afterwards, simply run 

```{bash}
./run_test_cvt_img.sh
```

And the tests will proceed.
