# Auto tests for Principles of Computer Organizations course

### Tests are rewritten for the c++ version of the lab

```c_str_lib``` directory should have ```mystring.hpp``` and ```mystring.cpp``` files.

### Usage
Go to directory with your lab and run following commands:
```
cd ../
git clone https://github.com/ucu-cs/c_strings_auto_testing auto_tests
cd auto_tests
cp -r ../c_str_lib ./
./compile.sh
./bin/gtester
```
### Important!

- I test this only on Arch Linux and Ubuntu.
- `pragma` is only for gcc compiler
